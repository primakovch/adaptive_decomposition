        "claim": "It Is Known That The Novel Coronavirus Has A Survival Rate Of 99.7%",
        "doc": "Does a graphic being widely shared on social media accurately represent the survival rate of the novel coronavirus at 99.7%? No, that's not true: Scientists do not know precisely how many people survive or recover from the virus versus how many people will die from it. The post is sharing a lot of misleading data without offering any sourcing to back up the numbers. Leading health organizations have preliminary estimates on the reproduction rate (r0) of the novel coronavirus, but there are still many unknowns. This post purports to be stating facts, but it is effectively trying to downplay the severity of the outbreak. The claim originated from a post (archived here) published by Jen Largent-Farnam on March 1, 2020. It opened: FACTS: #Coronavirus has a contagion factor of 2. SARS was 4. Measles is 18. #Coronavirus has a cure rate of 99.7% for those under 50 it infects. #Coronavirus spread is leveling off. This is a viral-pneumonia being hyped as The Black Plague before an election. Users on social media only saw this: The post claimed to be sharing facts, but the user offered no source material for any of these claims. In the comments section, other users repeatedly pressed the poster for sourcing and citations. Largent-Farnam said she got the information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Her claim that she retrieved the data from the CDC website is inaccurate. The CDC offers this disclaimer on the top of its page dedicated to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19: COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States. Largent-Farnam's post suggested that the novel coronavirus is less contagious than SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. That may be true, but there are still many unknowns, as scientists discover more information about how the new coronavirus spreads. One way to determine how infectious a disease might be is with the \"R naught\" (r0) rate. According to the University of Minnesota: The r0 is another way of saying how infectious a disease is, as it offers an average of how many people a single person can infect with a virus. If the r0 is less than 1, an outbreak dies; if the average is greater than one, it spreads. Highly infectious viruses, such as measles, have r0s between 10 and 20. The SARS outbreak in 2003 had an r0 of around 3. According to Business Insider, scientists do not currently agree on what that r0 rate is for the novel coronavirus. On January 23, 2020, the World Health Organization estimated the preliminary r0 to be between 1.4 and 2.5. Researchers at Lancaster University initially put the number at 3.8 but revised it down to 2.5. Meanwhile, doctors in China estimated the r0 was between 3.3 and 5.47. As researchers learn more about the novel coronavirus, these numbers will continue to shift. At a news conference on March 3, 2020, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said: Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported Covid-19 cases have died. The New York Times reported that the figure did not include \"mild cases that were not detected because people did not seek medical attention.\" According to the newspaper: The extent and mortality of the epidemic will not be known with great accuracy until a reliable test is developed for the antibodies present in people who have been infected, and that test is administered to large numbers of people. Another claim on the meme that is false pertains to the cure rate. There is no known cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus, though laboratories around the world are racing against the clock to create one. Some labs believe they have made some promising findings, but they won't move into the human testing phase until next month at the earliest. That means a vaccine could be a year or more away. There is currently no definitive data about how many people who become infected will survive the current outbreak. Lastly, the poster claimed the novel coronavirus is nothing more than viral pneumonia that is being hyped as a \"Black Plague\" in an election year. This effort to downplay concerns about the threat of the novel coronavirus is potentially dangerous. Viral pneumonia cannot be treated by antibiotics, but that treatment does work for the bubonic plague, which is not nearly as fatal as it once was. As of March 5, 2020, at least 3,000 people around the world have died from the novel coronavirus, and there are more than 90,000 cases, according to The New York Times. The outbreak has prompted airlines to cancel routes, forced some schools to close, and caused global stock markets to tumble. There is a lot of misinformation online about the novel coronavirus.

        "claim": "House prices have quadrupled since 1990, but average income has only risen by half.",
        "doc": "A graph shared on Facebook and Twitter shows average UK house prices quadrupling since 1990, while the average household income rose by about half. This is a misleading comparison because while the income figures have been adjusted for inflation, the house price figures haven't. In cash terms, average income has tripled during this time, which is a much larger rise than the chart suggests.. The graph gives its source as the Land Registry\u2014a government department registering property and land ownership.The graph is correct that the Land Registry shows the average UK residential property price (including flats) was \u00a357,726 in June 1990 . According to the Land Registry, the equivalent figure for June 2020 was \u00a3234,947 . The Facebook graph quotes a slightly higher figure of \u00a3237,834, which has also been reported by the government . (The differences are likely due to the way in which House Price Index data is updated as transactions are completed.) The graph also says the average UK household income for 2020 is \u00a337,100. This is the correct figure for the mean UK disposable household income (income after taxes and benefits) for the financial year ending April 2020 . (The exact figure is \u00a337,108 .) It is the figure for income in 1990\u2014 \u00a320,448\u2014that skews the graph. We can't find this exact number in the official data from the Office for National Statistics . It is close to the median figure for average household disposable income in 1990, which is \u00a320,249. But in order to compare it with the 2020 figure, we have to use the mean average, which is higher, at \u00a324,458. More importantly, both of these figures have been adjusted for inflation, to reflect the fact that a pound in 1990 was more valuable than it is now. Yet the house price figures have not been adjusted for inflation. This means that when the meme compared the growth in income with the growth in house prices using these measures, it was not comparing like with like. In order to do that, we have to convert the income figure for 1990 back to its original cash value at the time. This was a much lower number, \u00a312,353, which would make the bar chart in this post look quite different. In cash terms, in 1990, the average household would therefore have had a disposable household income of \u00a312,353, at a time when the average house cost about \u00a357,726. By comparison, in 2020, the average household income was \u00a337,108 and the average house price was about \u00a3234,947. During the last 30 years, therefore, the average household income has tripled, but the average house price has quadrupled. This may have made buying a house less affordable (although this is also affected by changing interest rates), but not to the extent that the chart on this post suggested.",

        "doc": "The latest state budget signed into law by GOP Gov. Rick Perry is expected to leave $6 billion-plus in the state\u2019s so-called rainy day fund, right?Nope, says first-term state Rep. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, who told the Texas Tribune for a June 24 article that while the $6 billion indeed went unspent in the 2012-13 budget, that\u2019s not the whole story.\"We\u2019ve got to get the message right,\" said Perry, who\u2019s of no relation to the governor. \"There\u2019s been a lot of misinformation out there that there\u2019s $6 billion in the fund that\u2019s not been used. It\u2019s been used.\"Eh?Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.6 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget, which runs through August.The governor recently told a New Orleans audience that Texas lawmakers balanced the budget while leaving $6 billion in a rainy day fund--a claim we rated Half True this week because his claim didn\u2019t acknowledge some costs that lawmakers put off paying until 2013.\"That\u2019s the governor\u2019s message,\" Rep. Perry told the Tribune. \"That\u2019s not Charles Perry the legislator\u2019s message.\"In an interview with us, the representative conceded the Republican-guided Legislature did not earmark the money expected to pile up in the fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion. But, he said, that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t have covered existing needs.Rep. Perry, informing us he\u2019s a CPA by trade, said underfunding Medicaid by $4.4 billion and postponing $2.3 billion in payments to school districts to the fiscal year starting in September 2013 amount to obligations that can\u2019t be denied.\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that (rainy-day) money is not restricted,\" he said. \"We know we\u2019re going to have to pay it.\"In separate interviews, Rep. Jim Pitts of Waxhachie and Sen. Steve Ogden of Bryan, who chair the respective House and Senate budget-drafting committees, agreed lawmakers left the cited items dangling. Both cautioned, though, that much could change to ease pressures by 2013. The state\u2019s economy could out-perform expectations, Medicaid caseloads might fall short of projections, Congress could even reduce what it expects states to chip in.Rep. Perry reminded us those are uncertain speculations. Plus, he suggested, it\u2019s likely \"we are going to see less and less money from the feds,\" noting that Congress is in talks to reduce federal spending and besides, states will ultimately be expected to pick up a share of the costs of the federal health care overhaul approved in 2010.Our take: Rep. Perry\u2019s statement overreaches because the money projected to pile up in the fund has not been used. Still, the 2011 Legislature adjourned amid expectations that when legislators next gather, they will lean on the fund to cover $6 billion in unpaid expenses.We rate his claim Barely True.",

        "claim": "On Sept. 27, 2021, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law that would require county election officials to mail every registered, active voter in California a ballot before elections.",
        "doc": "On Sept. 27, 2021, social media users circulated posts about California supposedly changing its election laws so that officials would automatically mail ballots to every active, registered voter in all future elections. The claim was true. On Sept. 27, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that would permanently force county election departments to mail every active,registeredvoter a ballot weeks before Election Day, according to legislative recordsobtained by Snopes. Before his approval, state statutes established such a program \u2014 though only temporarily. In the 2020 presidential election and 2021 failed effort to recall Newsom, officials sent all registered voters a ballot \u201cas a safety measure to counteract pandemic-related disruptions,\u201d as the governor described in a news release. However, under statutes governing universal voting by mail in those elections, the ballot distribution system would have expired at the end of 2021. According to Assembly Bill 37: Existing law requires county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter for all elections proclaimed or conducted prior to January 1, 2022. [\u2026]This bill would extend the requirements to mail a ballot to every registered voter to all elections and apply them to all local elections officials. Both the temporary and permeant measures drew sharp criticism from political conservatives, who argued the process of mailing ballots to millions of people could open the door to fraud. [See also from Snopes: Do Mail-In Ballots Increase Risk of Voter Fraud?] Before Newsom\u2019s approval of AB 37, for example, opponents drew attention to how county officials track who is \u2014 and who isn\u2019t \u2014 an active voter, the Los Angeles Times reported. \u201cActive\u201d and \u201cregistered\u201d voters are residents who are legally able to vote; have filled out paperwork to submit their names to the voting registrar; and are reachable via their addresses on file. In a story about the permanent change, the L.A. Times wrote: One persistent criticism focuses on elections officials\u2019 use of a list of inactive voters, those who may still be eligible to vote but haven\u2019t been reachable at their mailing address on file and who haven\u2019t cast ballots in recent elections. In some situations, inactive registrations are canceled after a voter fails to participate in two consecutive federal elections. When errors do occur, critics have insisted without any clear evidence that the mistakes are an indicator of larger, systemic problems. AB 37 stipulates that ballots can\u2019t be mailed to anyone on a county\u2019s inactive voter list. Republican lawmakers sought additional rules for how counties should maintain their lists of active and inactive voters. Those opponents also pushed unsuccessfully for stronger restrictions on who can turn in a completed ballot at designated drop-off sites or polling stations, as well as a shorter window for when ballots postmarked by Election Day can count, the LA Times reported. Supporters, however, believe the law makes voting in elections easier for more people. \u201cData shows that sending everyone a ballot in the mail provides voters access. And when voters get ballots in the mail, they vote,\u201d Assemblyman Marc Berman, D-Palo Alto, the bill\u2019s author, said during a Senate committee hearing in July 2021, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. That was indeed the case after California officials mailed every registered voter a ballot in the 2020presidential election between former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Almost 17.8 million people turned in completed ballots, according to the L.A. Times. That number accounted for about 71% of eligible voters, or the highest such percentage since 1951. \u201cLast year we took unprecedented steps to ensure all voters had the opportunity to cast a ballot during the pandemic and today we are making those measures permanent after record-breaking participation in the 2020 presidential election,\u201d Newsom said in the Sept. 27 release. With Newsom\u2019s approval of AB 37, California joined a handful of other U.S. states with the same type of programs, including Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. But, as the L.A. Times\u2019 story noted, no other state\u2019s effort is comparable due to California\u2019s population and the law\u2019s scope.

Rather, on November 2, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, Chaired by Jerome Powell, announced that it was hiking interest rates (called the federal funds rate) by 75 basis points. This was the sixth rate hike of 2022, aimed at curbing inflation and loose money policy, as is being done by central banks around the world. While Powell made this announcement on November 2, the minutes of the meeting itself where the decision was taken was released on November 23. According to this, while recent economic developments in the United Kingdom were discussed, there was no mention of meeting any governor of any African central bank, or the IMF or the World Bank The minutes of the meeting can be found here. The press conference and its transcript can be seen here. Further, the publicly available schedule of the Federal Reserve governors and chairs also show that no such meeting has taken place. 2. Have any of these insitutition met at any points this year? Yes, earlier in October, when the annual meeting of the Boards of IMF and the World Bank took place. The governors of several central banks and the finance ministers of several countries were also in attendance. This year, it took place in Washington DC from October 10 to 16. An African specific meeting also took place and was attended by the finance and agricultural ministers of five African countries and representatives of civil society, as can be found here. But the video recording and associated transcripts convey that the US dollar demonetisation as claimed was not discussed here. 3. Is there anything to show that the US dollar banknotes will be demonetised? No. The Federal Reserve maintains that all notes, regardless of when they were printed, remain legal tender, even after the introduction of new iterations of banknotes. As the Federal Reserve answers the question, \"Do I have to trade in my old-design notes when a new one begins circulating?\" with, \"No, you do not have to trade in your old-design notes for new ones. All U.S. currency remains legal tender, regardless of when it was issued.\" This can be seen here. ",

        "claim": "U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert has posed several times with AR-15 style guns, and that weapon was used in a March 2021 mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado.",
        "doc": "In March 2021, as Americans responded with horror to yet another mass shooting, this time at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, the popular left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats highlighted what it presented as rank hypocrisy on the part of controversial first-term Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a strident supporter of gun rights. The meme, posted on March 22, contained a photograph of Boebert and the following text: BREAKING NEWS: Lauren Boebert sends \u201cprayers\u201d to the victims of today\u2019s shooting in Boulder, Colorado. Boebert fetishizes guns and regularly poses for photos with AR-15 rifles, the same one used to murder 10 of her fellow Coloradoans today. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO BOEBERT? On March 23, Boulder police announced that they had arrested 21-year-old Colorado man Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, and charged him with 10 counts of murder in connection with a shooting rampage at the King Soopers grocery store on Table Mesa Drive in Boulder, on March 22. The description of Boebert \u201cfetishizing\u201d guns is a highly subjective one, and well beyond the scope of this fact check. However the meme accurately described Boebert\u2019s remarks in the aftermath of the March 2021 shooting, as well as her past record of posing for photographs holding or alongside AR-15 style guns. Initial information provided to Snopes by Boulder police indicates that the suspected shooter owned, carried and used an AR-15 style gun, or a variant thereof, but a definitive determination of the weapon used to kill each of the 10 individuals who died in the shooting will likely not be possible until ballistics testing and autopsies have been conducted. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cMixture.\u201d If relevant information becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly. On March 22, Boebert did indeed offer her prayers to those affected by the shooting, including the victims. So that component of the Occupy Democrats meme was accurate. In one tweet she wrote: My prayers are with the shoppers, employees, first responders & others affected by the shooting in Boulder. May God be with them. While we are still awaiting important information and details in this case, random public shootings & senseless acts of violence are never ok. And in another she wrote: As we continue to hear the news coming out of Boulder, I\u2019m praying for the police, first responders, and those affected by this tragedy. May God be with us as we make sense of this senseless violence, and may we unify and not divide during this time. It would perhaps be a stretch to say that Boebert regularly poses for photos with AR-15 rifles, but she has done so several times in recent years, and certainly more frequently than most Congress members and congressional candidates, and appears to have no aversion to appearing armed with, or next to, semi-automatic rifles. At a Feb. 18, 2021, virtual hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee, Boebert appeared sitting in front of a book case that visibly contained a handgun and three rifles, two of them similar in appearance to the AR-15: Democratic committee member Rep. Jared Huffman of California mocked Boebert, saying she had a \u201cshrine to [her] gun fetish as [her] Zoom background.\u201d In January 2020, while campaigning for the 3rd Congressional District seat she ultimately won, Boebert posed next to Alamosa County Sheriff Robert Jackson, holding an AR-15 style rifle, in a photograph she posted to her Instagram account: Boebert first came to prominence in 2014, when she opened Shooters Grill, a gun-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, which attracted the attention of local and national news media due to its policy of encouraging customers and staff to carry licensed firearms. Over the years, she has posed with AR-15 style guns on a few occasions, as part of efforts to promote the restaurant. In 2015, for example, Boebert was filmed firing an AR-15 style rifle on a shooting range, as part of a short online video about Shooters, produced by Barcroft Media: And in July 2019, Boebert posed at a gun show in Colorado, brandishing what appeared to be AR-15 style rifles, in photographs posted to the Instagram account of her restaurant: According to several details contained in a Boulder police arrest affidavit, provided to Snopes by the Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s office, the preponderance of evidence so far indicates that the suspected shooter owned, was armed with, and used an AR-15 style rifle, or a variant thereof, during the March 22 attack at King Soopers. The affidavit, written by Boulder police Detective Sarah Cantu and based on reports by various law enforcement officers and investigators, contains the following relevant information: The police affidavit in question states that Alissa had recently purchased a firearm which is a variant of an AR-15, several witnesses observed that the alleged assailant carried an AR-15 style gun, and a Boulder police officer reported that at one point Alissa shot at him with what he said appeared to be an \u201cassault rifle.\u201d (An AR-15 is a semi-automatic rifle, as distinct from an assault rifle, which allows the user to switch into fully automatic mode, but it\u2019s easy to see how an AR-15 or AR-15 variant could be mistaken for an assault rifle). However, definitive clarification as to the exact weapon or weapons used to kill the 10 individuals who lost their lives in the King Soopers attack will likely not be available until ballistics testing and autopsies have been conducted, and their results made public. If further pertinent information becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly. Until then, this component of the Occupy Democrats meme remains unproven, and we are therefore issuing a rating of \u201cMixture.\u201d",

        "claim": "Says Lee Leffingwell \"raised property taxes 20 percent in three years.\"",
        "doc": "Brigid Shea, running for mayor of Austin against incumbent Lee Leffingwell and activist Clay Dafoe, sent a mailer we spotted May 7, 2012, including a double-digit claim about hizzoner and taxes.\"Lee raised property taxes 20 percent in three years,\" the mailer says.All that much, and by his lonesome?Fortuitously, we had in hand a chart provided by the Travis Central Appraisal District showing the tax rate set by the Austin City Council each year from 1990-91 through 2011-12.Before Leffingwell was elected mayor, the council set a rate of 40.12 cents per $100 of appraised value for 2008-09, meaning the fiscal year through September 2009. Last year, the Leffingwell-led council set a rate of 48.11 cents for 2011-12. Put another way, the liability on a property valued at $100,000 before Leffingwell became mayor was $401.20. The liability in 2011-12 was $481.10.On its face, that\u2019s a 20 percent increase over three years -- as referenced on the flip side of Shea's mailer, which says: \"Lee voted to raise your property tax rate 20 percent in three years.\"But no mayor can set a tax rate on his or her own, which Shea knows because she\u2019s a former council member. Each year, the seven-member council votes on the rate as it completes the city\u2019s budget. In Austin\u2019s form of government, the mayor has one vote, like fellow council members. Asked by email about Shea\u2019s claim, the mayor\u2019s campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said: \"Lee did not raise these taxes \u2014 the Austin City Council raised these taxes.\"Another wrinkle: Leffingwell, a retired airline pilot, was on the council before he ran for mayor and had a vote on city tax rates set for every budget starting in 2005-06. Through his council tenure, the tax rate has dipped and gone up, according to the appraisal district\u2019s breakdown. In Leffingwell\u2019s first year on the council, members kept the previous year\u2019s rate of 44.30 cents per $100 in appraised value. Members cut the rate each of the next three years before raising it each of the next three years.Ed Van Eenoo, the city\u2019s budget officer, told us the council voted 7-0 for the three tax-rate changes \u2014 all increases \u2014 with Leffingwell as mayor.However, tax-rate changes alone don\u2019t reveal the pocketbook impact of city property taxes.Notably, for instance, Leffingwell said recently that Austin has the lowest tax rate by far of the five biggest Texas cities. That\u2019s so, but we rated his claim Half True after pointing out that any touting of tax rates is incomplete if it fails to fold in how much property-owners actually pay out.That\u2019s because property valuations and tax exemptions also influence what property owners pay. To gauge the property taxes owed the city, for instance, take your house\u2019s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate \u2014 with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than \"48.11 cents.\"Van Eenoo put it this way in an email reply to our inquiries about changes in the rates on the mayor\u2019s watch: \"Simply looking at tax rates does not provide a complete analysis as tax rates are heavily influenced by home values. When property values go up, the revenue needed to maintain operations can generally be achieved at a lower tax rate. Vice versa when values go down as they did in 2010 and 2011.\"One way to evaluate property tax rates without ignoring the role of home values, Van Eenoo said, is to compare the tax rate adopted by the council with what\u2019s known as the \"rollback rate.\" That\u2019s the maximum rate the city is allowed to set under state law without triggering a voter referendum. The rollback rate, Van Eenoo told us, is calculated as the rate that would bring in 8 percent more in revenue for operations and maintenance than in the previous year, plus enough money to pay the coming year\u2019s debt service.In keeping with the time period behind Shea\u2019s claim, let\u2019s focus on Leffingwell\u2019s mayoral years.In his first year leading the council, the tax rate set by the council was the rollback rate, as it had been for the previous three years. In the latter two years of Leffingwell\u2019s mayorship, the adopted tax rates were lower than the rollback rate, Van Eenoo said. In those years, then, the council didn\u2019t raise taxes as much as it could have.Yet another measure that takes into account changes in property values is the \"effective tax rate.\" That\u2019s the rate that the city would have to set to bring in roughly the same amount of revenue it received the year before on properties taxed in both years. In each year of Leffingwell\u2019s mayoral term, according to city data, the council\u2019s adopted tax rate exceeded the effective rate; on average, the rate was nearly 4 percent higher.Looking beyond rates, we wondered how much typical homeowners\u2019 city property tax bills had changed in the years Leffingwell has been mayor -- though we should note, of course, that the city is only one of the entities taxing Austin properties. Others include school districts, county government and community colleges.To support her statement that Leffingwell \"raised property taxes 20 percent in three years,\" Shea sent us data that she said showed tax bills for Austin homeowners had increased more than that amount since Leffingwell became mayor.Shea\u2019s analysis, which does not take into account exemptions, calculates annual tax bills using two different measures for home values: the median and average prices of homes sold in February of each year. Shea obtained the sales price information from the Texas A&M University Real Estate Center, which gathers data from real estate professionals across the state.Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a \"middle\" value \u2014 median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half the city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.For this reason, we put aside Shea\u2019s data on average sale price and stuck with her figures for the median. Those show that the city tax bill for a home valued at the February median sales price increased about 23 percent from 2008-09 ($753) to 2011-12 ($924).Still, Shea\u2019s data relies on the prices of homes sold in a single month each year. That\u2019s a small pool. We wondered whether there was a better representation of a typical Austin homeowner\u2019s property value.We found one in data from the city: annual \"median taxable value.\" Samantha Park, a city spokeswoman, told us that the \"taxable value\" of a home is the amount on which the city can actually tax. It\u2019s based on the appraised value, determined by the county\u2019s assessment, minus exemptions. The \"median taxable value,\" then, is the value at which half the city's homes were valued at more and half were valued at less.Next, we used the city\u2019s data to calculate how much the city taxes on a home with the median taxable value had changed during Leffingwell\u2019s mayoral term. Our calculations found an increase of about 25 percent from 2008-09 ($700) to 2011-12 ($877). That\u2019s greater than the 20 percent Shea cited on her mailer.Another factor to consider: inflation.Adjusting Shea\u2019s tax bill figures for inflation reduces the size of the increase during Leffingwell\u2019s mayorship to about 18 percent. Doing the same to the figures in our analysis of city data reduces the property tax increase to about 20 percent.We ran our work by the city. Park told us that our calculations of the city-provided data were fine, but that she had a quibble with our use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index to account for inflation in property tax increases.The CPI, Park said, \"takes into account the change in price for goods and services purchased by households, not government services that are provided,\" which is what taxpayers are funding through their property tax bills. And she suggested that rising prices may be hitting governments harder than consumers. To illustrate her point, she noted that the price of a gallon of milk rises more slowly than the price of health care services for city employees.Also, she said, our analysis does not consider the cost of \"improvements in service delivery.\" As an example, she pointed to the City Council\u2019s decision to turn the the city\u2019s animal shelter into a \"no-kill facility.\" We take this as saying the city chose to do more things \u2014 and those had costs.In response to the city\u2019s concern about the CPI, we used a different index \u2014 one from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis that gauges inflation for state and local governments \u2014 to adjust the tax bill figures in Shea\u2019s and our data. That reduces the increases by only half a percentage point compared to our calculations using the CPI.Our rulingMindful that tax rates alone paint an incomplete picture of the impact of property taxes, which are also driven by changes in property values, we found that what a typical Austin homeowner \u2014 one with the median-value home \u2014 paid in taxes went up 25 percent in the three years that Leffingwell\u2019s served as Austin mayor. Adjusted for inflation, that figure drops somewhat, but is still about 20 percent.So, taxes went up 20 percent, or more, with Leffingwell as mayor.However, no Austin mayor can raise taxes solo commando. Leffingwell had one of the seven votes that were cast each year in setting the city\u2019s rates. This significant perspective is absent from Shea\u2019s statement, making her claim Half True.",

        "doc": "CLAIM The pH for the coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5. What we need to do to defeat the coronavirus is to consume more alkaline foods above the virus\u2019 pH level. more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Facebook users, Facebook, 15 Apr. 2020 DETAILS Factually inaccurate: Viruses do not have a pH themselves, nor can the pH of the tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2 be altered by food intake. KEY TAKE AWAY Scientists have not determined the ideal pH environment for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the cells of the tissues that SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets, including the lungs and intestines, maintain a very tightly controlled pH both inside and out in order to maintain cellular metabolism and proper enzyme activity. Altering pH in cells and tissues beyond a very narrow range would likely result in death. FULL CLAIM: The pH for the coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5. What we need to do to defeat the coronavirus is to consume more alkaline foods above the virus\u2019 pH level. An image containing the claim that eating alkaline foods can \u201cdefeat\u201d SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been shared at least 800,000 times on Facebook since early April 2020. This claim is incorrect and displays a fundamental misunderstanding of basic science principles. First, viruses do not have their own pH. Sarah Stanley, an associate professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley, explained to The Associated Press that \u201cpH is something that applies to a water-based solution, which a virus is not.\u201d Second, the pH of the body\u2019s different tissues, blood, and cells are all very tightly controlled, as is the extracellular environment where the virus first binds to cells. \u201cThe body maintains a very narrow pH (7-7.4), which is the range at which the chemical reactions that keep us alive are optimal\u201d, writes Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine. \u201cIf the pH strays outside this range, you will indeed become acutely ill. For this reason animals have evolved a host of powerful mechanisms to keep the blood and tissues within this very narrow pH. \u2026.These mechanisms for maintaining a narrow range of pH (in a healthy person) overwhelm the effect of whatever you eat or drink.\u201d The pH of saliva can indeed vary depending on overall health, the presence of periodontal disease, or food intake[1], but the mouth is not the only route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 and so far it doesn\u2019t appear to contain the same density of cells containing the ACE2 receptors that the virus targets as do other tissues. Currently, the tissues that are thought to be more vulnerable to infection include the lungs, esophagus, heart, kidney, bladder, and intestines, which again are tightly controlled in terms of pH[2,3]. Finally, and perhaps most glaringly, the post lists the wrong pH values for all of the foods that it recommends eating to combat SARS-CoV-2. In fact, every food item on the list has an acidic pH\u2014that is, below 7\u2014rather than an alkaline pH as the post suggests. Further, two of the food items, avocado and dandelion, are labeled with pH values that are rarely if ever found in nature, let alone in foods that people could safely consume. In summary, food at any pH will not alter the very tightly controlled pH of tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, an alkaline diet will neither prevent nor treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        "doc": "In this article, we fact check some numbers related to the MUDRA scheme and the Stand Up India scheme. The government made certain claims about its commitment to social justice in an infographic titled \u2018promoting entrepreneurship for socio-economic empowerment\u2019. The following article is a fact check of the data provided in the infographic. What is the MUDRA scheme? Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched by the Prime Minister in April 2015 for providing loans up to Rs. 10 lakh to the non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. These loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, Cooperative Banks, MFIs and NBFCs. The borrower can approach any of the lending institutions mentioned above or can apply online through the portal. However, it has to noted that the focus on the MSME sector is not a new phenomenon. The first NDA government launched the Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for MSMEs in August 2000 to provide guarantee cover for collateral free credit facilities extended to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). During the UPA, the Government had constituted a Prime Minister\u2019s Task Force on Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) in September 2009, which submitted its report in January 2010. The report had made recommendations in the areas of credit, marketing, labour issues, rehabilitation and exit policy, infrastructure/technology/skill development, taxation and special measures for North-Eastern Region and Jammu & Kashmir. Among other things, the recommendations of the task force also include advice to the banks to achieve a 20% year-on-year growth in credit to MSEs and a 10% annual growth in the number of micro enterprise accounts. The banks have also been advised that the allocation of 60% of the MSE advances to the micro enterprises is to be achieved in stages viz., 50 per cent in the year 2010-11, 55 per cent in the year 2011-12 and 60 per cent in the year 2012-13. Many other steps were also recommended and some were implemented during the previous government. PMMY being implemented by the current government is a dedicated scheme for MSEs that led to the establishment of Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency Ltd (MUDRA). MUDRA bank is essentially a refinancing institution and does not directly lend loans to end customers. Rather, the loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, Cooperative Banks, MFIs and NBFCs. Has the lending target under MUDRA scheme been increased? The first claim is that the lending target under the MUDRA scheme has been enhanced to 3 lakh rupees for the financial year 2018-19. In Union Budget speech (2018-19), Arun Jaitley said \u2018it is proposed to set a target of 3 lakh crore for lending under MUDRA for 2018-19 after having successfully exceeded the targets in all previous years\u2019. Claim: The lending target under the MUDRA scheme has been enhanced to 3 lakh rupees for the financial year 2018-19. Fact: It is proposed to set a target of 3 lakh crore for lending under MUDRA for 2018-19. Hence, the claim is TRUE. What is the demographic division of MUDRA account loans? The second related claim is that \u2018of the total loan accounts (under the MUDRA scheme), 76% are of women and over 50% are SCs, STs and OBCs\u2019. The PMMY website has year wise performance reports on the website. Data from these reports suggests that out of a total of 12.27 crore loan accounts under the MUDRA scheme between 2015-16 and 2017-18, 9.03 crore belong to women entrepreneurs and 6.71 crore belong to SCs/STs/OBCs. Hence the percentage of loan accounts belonging to women is around 74% while those belonging to SCs/STs/OBCs is around 55%. Claim: of the total loan accounts (under the MUDRA scheme), 76% are of women and over 50% are SCs, STs and OBCs. Fact: Data from performance reports of PMMY suggests that out of a total of 12.27 crore loan accounts under the MUDRA scheme between 2015-16 and 2017-18, 9.03 crore belong to women entrepreneurs and 6.71 crore belong to SCs/STs/OBCs. Hence the percentage of loan accounts belonging to women is around 74% while those belonging to SCs/STs/OBCs is around 55%. Hence the claim is TRUE. However, it has to be noted that focus on the MSE sector is not a new phenomenon. What is the Stand-up India scheme? Government of India launched the Stand Up India scheme in April 2016. Stand Up India scheme caters to promoting entrepreneurship amongst Women, SC & ST category i.e. those section of the population facing significant hurdles due to lack of advice/ mentorship as well as inadequate and delayed credit. The scheme intends to leverage the institutional credit structure to reach out to these underserved sectors of the population in starting greenfield enterprise. It caters to both ready and trainee borrowers. The Scheme facilitates bank loans between Rs.10 lakh and Rs.1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe borrower and at least one Woman borrower per bank branch of Scheduled Commercial Banks for setting up greenfield enterprises in trading, manufacturing and services sector. 51% of the shareholding and controlling stake has to be held by an SC/ST of woman entrepreneur in case of a non-individual enterprise. To extend collateral free coverage, Government of India has set up the Credit Guarantee Fund for Stand Up India (CGFSI). The scheme is built on the concept of providing handholding support to those borrowers who might have a project in mind but lack the confidence and capability to start up. It also provides for convergence with Central/State Government schemes. Applications under the scheme can also be made online. An online tracking system in the dedicated Stand Up India portal is being utilized. As of December 2018, more than 68000 loans have been sanctioned under the scheme out of which 53,284 are disbursed. How many loans were sanctioned under the Stand-up India scheme? The third claim is that, \u2018under Stand up India mission, 54,733 loans were sanctioned by the banks to SC, ST and women borrowers (up to February 2018)\u2019. The annual report (2017-18) of the Department of Financial Services, published in March 2018 puts this number at 50887. This data was till the 10th of January 2018 only. More updated data was provided in a Lok Sabha answer on the 9th March 2018 which states that \u2018loans extended as on 04.03.2018 since inception of the scheme is 54,947\u2019. Claim: Under Stand up India mission, 54,733 loans were sanctioned by the banks to SC, ST and women borrowers (up to February 2018). Fact: Up to the 9th March 2018, the loans extended under the Stand-up India scheme are 54,947. The numbers are higher than the ones in the claim because of the dynamic nature of data collection. Hence, the claim is TRUE. How much money was sanctioned to SC entrepreneurs? The fourth claim related to the previous one is that, \u2018under the same scheme, 239.12 crores for SC entrepreneurs (up to May 2018)\u2019. According to an answer provided in Lok Sabha, a total of 9477 loans have been sanctioned for SC entrepreneurs, while 7263 loans have been disbursed as of December 2018. The annual report (2017-18) of the Department of Financial Services shows that Rs, 1344.7 crore rupees have been sanctioned to SCs under 7086 accounts, by January of 2018. It is not known as to what part of the sanctioned amount is disbursed. Claim: Under the Stand-up India scheme, 239.12 crores for SC entrepreneurs (up to May 2018). Fact: Up until January of 2018, Rs. 1,344.7 crore rupees have been sanctioned for SC entrepreneurs. It is not known as to what part of the sanctioned amount is disbursed. Hence, the claim remains UNVERIFIED. Is a new venture capital fund for OBCs launched? The final claim, also related to the previous two is that, \u2018a new venture capital fund for OBCs is to be launched with an initial corpus of 200 crore rupees\u2019. A new venture capital fund for OBCs was announced in the 2018-19 budget, but no allocation was made. Budget allocations were made in the 2019-20 budget for such a fund, but there is no evidence of the fund being launched. Claim: A new venture capital fund for OBCs is to be launched with an initial corpus of 200 crore rupees, under the Stand-up India scheme. Fact: A new venture capital fund for OBCs was announced in the 2018-19 budget, but no allocation was made. Budget allocations were made in the 2019-20 budget for such a fund, but there is no evidence of the fund being launched. Hence this claim remains UNVERIFIED.

        "claim": "Because of voter fraud, Republican candidates \"need to do a point or two better\" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin.",
        "doc": "Not four hours after Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus made a provocative statement about voter fraud in Wisconsin, news surfaced that three cases of suspected voter fraud were being investigated by law enforcement in suburban Milwaukee.The coincidence, of course, isn\u2019t proof of anything.But how extensive is illegal voting in Wisconsin?In a May 30, 2012, conference call with reporters, Priebus said that because of voter fraud, Republican candidates \"need to do a point or two better\" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin.Priebus, who headed the Wisconsin Republican Party before taking charge of the national party in January 2011, was referring to percentage points of the total votes cast.GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made essentially the same claim to The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, in an article posted online more than a week earlier.Both statements, of course, were in advance of the June 5, 2012, recall election, pitting Walker against Democratic challenger Tom Barrett.In the 2010 race for governor -- which featured Walker, Barrett and several minor candidates -- more than 2.16 million votes were cast. One percent of the total would be some 21,600 votes; 2 percent, 43,200 votes. (Walker won with 52.3 percent to Barrett\u2019s 46.5 percent.)In the 2008 presidential election, more than 2.98 million votes were cast in Wisconsin. One percent would be nearly 30,000 votes and 2 percent would be nearly 60,000.Priebus\u2019 evidenceRepublican National Committee spokesman Ryan Mahoney cited two items to back Priebus\u2019 claim:Milwaukee police report: A Milwaukee Police Department report on the November 2004 election, released in February 2008, blamed shoddy record keeping by city election officials and error-prone poll workers for flaws that allowed illegal and improper voting in Milwaukee.The task force found numerous problems in the voting process that could lead to fraudulent voting. The report concluded by saying the task force \"believes that there was fraud committed in the 2004 election, but as one investigator stated, \u2018I know I voted in the election, but I can\u2019t be certain it counted.\u2019\"Police Chief Edward Flynn distanced himself from the report, however, saying it contained the views of the investigators, not the department.Priebus opinion article: A Priebus column published in June 2011 cited voter fraud-related allegations in several states, but his only mention of Wisconsin was the Milwaukee police report.Really, that\u2019s it?Needless to say, Priebus\u2019 evidence doesn\u2019t begin to back his claim, which applies a specific percentage to how much fraud occurs.But there has been a history of voting irregularities in Wisconsin, from felons improperly voting to more votes being counted in Milwaukee than people listed as having voted.Would that tally the 1 percent to 2 percent?Flaws in election processThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found myriad voting problems occurred in Milwaukee and other parts of the state in the 2004 election, the one later investigated by the Milwaukee police and state and federal prosecutors.Three of the newspaper\u2019s findings provide some perspective:1. In Milwaukee, there was a discrepancy between the ballot count and the number of people listed as having voted of about 7,000.(Investigators were later able to whittle the discrepancy to 4,600 votes, or 1.67 percent of the 277,000 votes cast in the city.)2. Some 1,300 on-site voter registrations in Milwaukee could not be processed for a variety of reasons, including missing addresses and missing names. More than 140 of those who voted listed addresses outside the city.3. At least 278 cases statewide where felons may have improperly voted, though the number was likely considerably higher, since only a partial review of those who voted was possible.The Journal Sentinel reports prompted a joint federal-state investigation in 2005. Those investigators found more than 200 cases of felons voting illegally in Milwaukee and at least 100 cases of double voting in the 2004 election, numbers that echoed the newspaper\u2019s findings.About a dozen cases of voter fraud were pursued, with mixed results, but then-U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic concluded there had been no findings of widespread fraud.Then-Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann said in June 2005 he was troubled by the 4,600-vote discrepancy that remained, suggesting that questions will linger about whether systematic fraud occurred in the city.\"I have a reservation about those 4,600 votes,\" he said. Situation today Meanwhile, a host of reforms that came after the 2005 Journal Sentinel investigation -- including the start of a statewide voter list and comparisons of it to a database of felons -- means the situation today has changed since 2004.For a current assessment, we asked Kevin Kennedy, director of the state Government Accountability Board, which runs Wisconsin\u2019s elections, to respond to Priebus\u2019 claim.Kennedy cited a number of reforms in addition to the statewide voter list, including routine checks of the voter list for felons, recently deceased persons and duplicate registrations; and post-election checks for duplicate and felon voting.Kennedy also said the board has found no more than 20 instances of voter fraud in any statewide election dating back to 2000 and that Priebus has never filed a voter fraud complaint with his office.Our ratingPriebus said that because of voter fraud, Republican candidates \"need to do a point or two better\" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin.Past reports have highlighted flaws in the city of Milwaukee, including cases of fraudulent votes. But Priebus made a specific numerical claim -- that a Republican candidate, to compensate for fraudulent votes, would need to get 1 to 2 percentage points worth of additional votes in order to win a statewide election.Priebus did not provide information that supports the claim. We rate his statement False. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel web page.)",

German TV put the #PeoplesVoteMarch at 2.2 million, according to a German methodology for estimating crowds pic.twitter.com/l81mRx9kq3 \u2014 Mike Butcher (@mikebutcher) October 20, 2019 The tweet is incorrect. We've found no evidence that German TV reported a figure of 2.2 million people at the march, and the claim seems to originate from an anonymous twitter account. Most of the coverage that we've seen from German media, both broadcast and online, reported a number in the tens or hundreds of thousands. A couple of German news websites also quoted the organisers' estimate of one million people. We also spoke to experts in crowd science at the Manchester Metropolitan University. They told us that a total crowd of two million people was implausible. Their estimates found that the number was most likely in the low hundreds of thousands, and certainly not in the millions.

The April 8 post says outcomes from COVID-19 are similar for people who are vaccinated or unvaccinated. \"Why are these idiots still THANKING the vaccine?\" said the post by Jenna Ellis, a contributor at conservative website Newsmax. \"Many people who were NOT vaccinated also experienced zero or mild symptoms.

Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven\u2019t already to protect yourself and your family.\" The Facebook post was flagged as part of the platform\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post omits important context: People who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 are hospitalized for and die from the virus at much higher rates than those who have had at least two doses of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, in February, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the unvaccinated in the U.S. compared with the vaccinated was two times higher among those age five to 11, and five times higher among ages 50 to 64. \"\u200b\u200bUnvaccinated people in all age groups had higher case and death rates than people vaccinated with a primary series in the same age groups,\" the CDC reported as of March 17. The CDC has estimated that two or three doses of an mRNA vaccine reduce risk for COVID-19 invasive mechanical ventilation or death by 90%, and three doses of vaccine during the omicron surge reduced the risk by 94%. While there were more breakthrough COVID-19 cases with the omicron variant, vaccines continued to protect against infection, serious illness and death. While some people who are not vaccinated may not have experienced serious COVID-19 symptoms when infected, this claim ignores the data that show the virus is far more serious and fatal in people who are unvaccinated.

        "claim": "Video shows Donald Trump supporters rallying in New York on March 19, 2023",
        "doc": "\"Today in front of Trump Tower NYC!!!\" says a March 19, 2023 tweet sharing the clip, which received more than 720,000 views. \"Trump supporters have shut down 5th Ave in NYC right outside Trump Tower,\" says another. Similar posts shared the video in severallanguages across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Telegram. The claims came one day after Trump said in a March 18, 2023 Truth Social post that he \"will be arrested on Tuesday of next week.\" The former president called for his supporters to \"protest\" and \"take our nation back,\" echoing his rhetoric leading up to the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Trump was referencing a probe by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The investigation centers on $130,000 paid weeks before the 2016 election to allegedly stop Stormy Daniels, a porn actress, from going public about an affair she says she had with Trump years earlier. New York officials have made security preparations and braced for unrest amid a potential indictment, which would be the first criminal charge brought against a former or sitting US president. A few dozen protesters gathered in New York City on March 20 and March 21, although no charges had been announced as of 1830 GMT on the latter date. The video shared online does not show those demonstrators -- it was taken at a rally outside Trump Tower two-and-a-half years ago, the event's organizer confirmed to AFP. \"The videos going around were from the October 4, 2020 Trump caravan that was also accompanied by a food drive in which several pickup truck loads of food were delivered to Hour Children food pantry after the caravan progressed down Fifth Avenue,\" Shawn Farash said in a March 20 email. Farash, who organized the event on behalf of the right-wing Long Island Loud Majority organization, also clarified the origin of the footage in a series of tweets. \"This is not Sunday 3/19,\" he said in one post published the same day. \"This was October 4th 2020. How do I know? Because my organization put this rally together.\" In another, Farash added: \"Anyone who sees video of a rally outside of Trump Tower, know that it is NOT HAPPENING TODAY.\" A Facebook event, which Farash confirmed to AFP is authentic, described the rally as a drive into New York City from Long Island, New York. Farash said the event listed the destination as Times Square, not Fifth Avenue, so as to divert potential counter-protesters. News reports from local television stations and outlets such as the New York Post and Fox News characterized the rally as a show of support for Trump, who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 days prior. Other indicators that the video is old: Numerous rallygoers wave flags for Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, and a bus sports an advertisement for \"The Comey Rule,\" a television miniseries that aired that year. Some people in the video shared online, including a man with a \"Trump 2020\" flag draped over his shoulders, are also visible in pictures published by outlets such as the New York Post and the Daily Mail. AFP reached out to the New York City Police Department for comment, but a response was not forthcoming. AFP has debunked other misinformation about Trump rallies here, here and here.",

        "claim": "\"Tax revenue went up, actually, $14 billion last year after the tax cut actually occurred. We had greater revenue.\"",
        "doc": "Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., recently took to cable TV to tout the December 2017 tax law, a law he said was fiscally responsible. On March 6, Lankford appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe,\" a day after the Treasury Department reported that the federal deficit was 77 percent higher during the first four months of fiscal year 2019 than it was during the equivalent time period a year earlier. \"I've had a lot of folks push back and say the tax cuts that happened last year contributed to the deficit,\" Lankford said on MSNBC on March 6. \"The facts are actually coming out different. Yesterday I laid out on the floor that the numbers for fiscal year \u201817 and \u201818 are in. Tax revenue went up, actually, $14 billion last year after the tax cut actually occurred. We had greater revenue.\" Lankford was referring to a Senate floor speech he\u2019d given on March 5. Here\u2019s an excerpt: \"We are now a fiscal year through. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017\u2014the year before the tax reform\u2014was $3.315 trillion. Our revenue after the tax cut and the tax reform, for fiscal year 2018, is $3.329 trillion. If you are doing the math in your head, that is $14 billion more in revenue after the tax cuts. That means our revenue went up the next year. Contrary to all the myths that were out there early on saying we were going to have this giant hole in the budget, our revenue went up after the tax cuts went into place.\" Is Lankford correct that tax revenue went up after the tax law was passed? His office reiterated that between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, tax collections did indeed go up in nominal dollars by about $14 billion, according to Treasury Department data. However, as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget points out, revenues decreased if you factor in inflation or calculate it as a percentage of GDP. Perhaps more importantly, looking at the issue this way glosses over a major flaw: A significant share of the fiscal year 2018 revenues Lankford considered to be \"after the tax cut\" were actually governed by the old tax law, as we noted in an October 2018 fact-check of a similar claim by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. That\u2019s the case because several months during fiscal year 2018 either occurred before the tax law went into effect (specifically, October, November and December) or were dominated by annual tax payments made under the old tax code\u2019s rules (February, March and April). So the best way to compare pre-law and post-law tax collection patterns is to look at months that were governed by different laws. Using monthly Treasury Department reports, we separated out the following eight months where there is a clean comparison: June, July, August, and September (in fiscal years 2017 and 2018) and October, November, December, and January (in fiscal years 2018 and 2019). This chart summarizes what we found. This chart paints quite a different picture than Lankford offered. Of the eight months we looked at, tax collections declined in seven after the new law took effect. And if you combine the cumulative total from those eight months, tax collections went down by almost $61 billion -- a much less optimistic finding than Lankford\u2019s $14 billion increase. Ben Page, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, called the differences in tax collection before and after the law \"striking.\" Outside of a recession, he said, a combination of population growth, general economic expansion and inflation usually pushes tax collections higher from year to year. And that didn\u2019t happen for seven of these eight months. Lankford said, \"Tax revenue went up, actually, $14 billion last year after the tax cut actually occurred. We had greater revenue.\" This figure comes from a misleading calculation, one in which part of the increase in fiscal year 2018 came from tax collections governed by the old law. If you look at eight months that were shaped by a true before-and-after comparison, tax collections went down in seven of those months, and collectively, revenues fell by about $61 billion. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "From 1947 to 1979, family incomes for rich, middle-income and poor Americans grew about the same rate. But since 1979, incomes for rich families have grown much faster.",
        "doc": "A reader recently sent us a chart posted at the website of MoveOn.org, a liberal group. It aimed to show how incomes across the board rose from the end of World War II until 1979. But then, starting in 1979, they slowed for lower-income Americans while accelerating dramatically for the richest.The graphic was produced by the group United for a Fair Economy, a group that \"raises awareness that concentrated wealth and power undermine the economy, corrupt democracy, deepen the racial divide, and tear communities apart.\" Previously, we rated a bumper sticker the group produced.The group\u2019s chart represents the growth in income for various income groupings as flowers, with the height of the flower proportionate to the size of the increase. The text says, \"Comparing the growth of U.S. family incomes. 1947-1979 we grew together. 1979-2008 we grew apart.\"The chart provided these statistics for the two periods:1947-1979: Bottom 20 percent of the income distribution: 118 percent increaseSecond-to-bottom 20 percent: 100 percent increaseMiddle 20 percent: 111 percent increaseSecond-to-highest 20 percent: 114 percent increaseHighest 20 percent: 99 percent increaseHighest 5 percent: 86 percent increase1979-2008: Bottom 20 percent of the income distribution: 7 percent decreaseSecond-to-bottom 20 percent: 6 percent increaseMiddle 20 percent: 11 percent increaseSecond-to-highest 20 percent: 23 percent increaseHighest 20 percent: 49 percent increaseHighest 5 percent: 73 percent increaseHighest 1 percent: 224 percent increaseWe tracked down the raw data the group used for its calculations, and the group later confirmed that they had used the same statistics in assembling the graph. All but one of the categories -- the calculation for the highest 1 percent -- came from figures published by the U.S. Census Bureau, a source we consider reliable. For the 1979 -2008 Census data, the increases in the chart can be calculated directly. For the 1947-1979 Census data, the figures have to be reverse-engineered, but we were able to replicate the group\u2019s methodology without much difficulty. In both cases, we used inflation-adjusted figures.Ultimately, our calculations came up with some slightly different numbers, but the tallies were extremely close.For 1947 to 1979, our increases ranged from 81 percent to 122 percent, depending on the income group, while United for a Fair Economy came up with a range of 86 percent to 118 percent.For 1979 to 2008, our numbers ranged from a 4 percent decrease to a 73 percent increase, while United for a Fair Economy ranged from a 7 percent decrease to a 73 percent increase.Since the numbers are close -- and more importantly, since they showed the same overall pattern -- we aren\u2019t going to quibble over the differences.And what about that final statistic, on the income growth for the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2008? The group pointed to data from economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who have amassed a trove of data on income inequality.We ran the numbers and came up with a 169 percent increase for the top 1 percent between 1979 and 2008. That\u2019s less than the 224 percent indicated in the chart. The number is closer if you take the top half of 1 percent -- 213 percent. But even that doesn\u2019t quite get you there.Economists we contacted suggested that the numbers may have been adjusted to include capital gains, since the original Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains, and capital gains are an important income source for the very wealthy. But even if United for a Fair Economy\u2019s final number is off, it\u2019s still a whopping increase in income compared to the statistics for lower- and middle-income brackets.We also checked with a range of economists to see if the comparison the group was making was somehow unfair. To one degree or another, each of our experts said the comparison was acceptable.\"My impression is that you would find basically the same story using any available tabulation of the inflation-adjusted income series for the U.S.,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, noted some methodological imperfections with these kinds of studies -- including their failure to account for the value of employer-provided health care and Medicare -- but he said he doesn\u2019t doubt the overall trend.\"When all is said and done, there is fairly uniform consensus that starting in the late 1970s, the distribution of income in society became significantly more unequal,\" he said.Two conservative economists -- Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute and J.D. Foster of the Heritage Foundation -- raised some of the same methodological concerns as Steuerle, and they also warned against drawing broader conclusions than the data can support.For instance, both noted that the chart, striking as it is, doesn\u2019t say that someone in the lowest 20 percent is doomed to stay there. \"When you add income mobility to the equation, the left's rich-get-richer-and-poor-get-poorer story gets rather blurry,\" Mitchell said.Still, despite some modest differences in the final numbers, the story told by the United for a Fair Economy chart strikes us as pretty accurate. So we rate the chart Mostly True.",

And is this a GOP-sanctioned effort? We looked into the challengers\u2019 Republican bona fides.They emphasized that the Republican Party is not coordinating their efforts. Swensson told PolitiFact Georgia that he reached out to the party for its support and got none.\"Basically, what I get from them is crickets,\" Swensson said. \"Lots and lots of crickets.\"Georgia Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Everhart distanced the state party from the challenges.\"The Georgia Republican Party is not a party to any of those challenges, and had no knowledge of them before they were filed,\" Everhart said in a statement released by a party spokesman.The challengers all said their efforts have nothing to do with their party affiliations.\"It\u2019s an entirely nonpartisan effort. It has nothing to do with politics, only to do with the Constitution,\" said Welden, who said he has voted Republican but leans independent. That said, challenges do have significant GOP ties.State Rep. Mark Hatfield, a Republican attorney from Waycross, represents Powell and Swensson in their challenge. He is vice chairman of the state House\u2019s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee and is listed as the Republicans\u2019 deputy majority whip.Last year, Hatfield sponsored legislation that would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state\u2019s ballot.Swensson is chairman of the Clayton County Republican Party.Tennessee lawyer Van Irion represents Welden. He ran for Congress in 2010 and won the backing of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Irion lost in the Republican primary.Orly Taitz, a California lawyer, represents Farrar. She ran unsuccessfully in 2010 to be the Republican nominee for California secretary of state.Farrar told PolitiFact Georgia he considers himself a Republican. Voter records show Powell voted in six Georgia primaries between 1996 and 2008 and chose a Republican ballot in all of them. How do we rule?There are efforts to \"remove Barack Obama from Georgia\u2019s Presidential Ballot in 2012,\" as Democrats said.Whether \"Republicans\" are trying to do this is a dicier issue. The Georgia Democrats\u2019 language could lead a reasonable person to think that the effort is organized by the GOP.It\u2019s not. Nevertheless, these challenges are dyed bright red. A GOP state representative does represent two of the challengers, and two unsuccessful Republican candidates from Tennessee and California represent the rest.One challenger is chairman of his county GOP. Three of the four challengers consider themselves Republicans, and all of them have voted Republican.Because the state party is not involved in the challenge, but individual Republicans are leading the charge, we rate the Georgia Democrats\u2019 statement Half True.",

        "doc": "As Kenya approaches its August 2022 general election, old photos are appearing online \u2013 with dodgy claims. Africa Check has already debunked a photo circulating on Facebook that users said showed Raila Odinga, as a child, refusing in 1952 to give flowers to the UK's Princess Elizabeth \u2013 today's Queen Elizabeth. Odinga, Kenya's former prime minister and a longtime opposition leader, is expected to run in the 2022 election. A photo more recently posted on a political Facebook group shows Kenya's second president, Daniel arap Moi, pointing a finger in conversation with a tall, tracksuit-clad man. Moi ruled for almost a quarter of a century , from 1978 to 2002. He died in February 2020. The caption reads : \"Moi elect Ruto 1991 youths leader.\" This suggests that the man in the tracksuit is William Ruto, today Kenya's deputy president . Ruto is also expected to run for the presidency in 2022. Does the photo show Moi \"electing\" a younger Ruto, back in 1991? Moi with Dawo before pivotal match in 1987 A reverse image search reveals that the man in the tracksuit is Kenya's renowned international footballer Peter Dawo . According to an October 2019 article by veteran sports writer Roy Gachuhi , the photo shows Moi speaking to Dawo before his team, Gor Mahia , met Esperance of Tunisia in the 1987 Africa Cup Winners Cup final return match, which they won . The photo doesn't show Daniel arap Moi electing William Ruto as \"youths leader\" in 1991. It's Moi with footballer Peter Dawo, in 1987.",

        "claim": "In early March 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden\u2019s two dogs were sent to their family home in Delaware because the youngest dog, Major, bit someone at the White House.",
        "doc": "Biden\u2019s Press Secretary Jen Psaki said someone at the White House approached Major, the family\u2019s youngest dog, on March 8, 2021, and the dog \u201creacted in a way that resulted in a minor injury.\u201d Additionally, it is true that as of this writing, both dogs are staying at the family\u2019s home in Delaware, not Washington, D.C. However, Psaki said the dogs\u2019 trip to Delaware was scheduled before the above-referenced outburst by Major, that it was a result of Jill Biden\u2019s work schedule, not the dogs\u2019 behavior, and that they would be returning to the White House. It is unclear in what way, precisely, Major injured someone \u2014 whether by biting, scratching, or some other action \u2014 based on the press secretary\u2019s account. Also, the victim\u2019s relationship to, or status within, the White House remains unknown. In March 2021, reports surfaced claiming U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden\u2018s two German shepherds, Major and Champ, were no longer living at the presidential mansion and instead staying at the family\u2019s home in the Wilmington suburbs because one of the dogs supposedly bit a White House security officer. The rumor stemmed from two anonymous sources who claimed to have firsthand experience of the dogs\u2019 demeanor at the White House and spoke to CNN for a news story that published March 8. The article alleged: Major, who was adopted by Biden in November 2018 from a Delaware animal shelter, had what one of the people described as a \u2018biting incident\u2019 with a member of White House security. The exact condition of the victim is unknown, however, the episode was serious enough that the dogs were subsequently moved to Wilmington, Delaware, where they remain. [\u2026] Major, who is 3 years old, is the younger of the two Biden dogs, and has been known to display agitated behavior on multiple occasions, including jumping, barking, and \u2018charging\u2019 at staff and security. Over the course of hours, other reputable news outlets, including The Guardian and Business Insider, recirculated CNN\u2019s reporting based on unnamed sources. It was unclear why or under what circumstances no one spoke on the record about the dog\u2019s alleged behavior and trip. Social media lit up. Interpreted by Twitter users as proof of the alleged ordeal, a photo by a Bloomberg reporter showed a dog bed resting outside the White House. No evidence existed to doubt the authenticity of the image, though it was unclear if, or to what extent, it was related to the purported aggression. During an afternoon news conference on March 9, however, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki provided some clarity on the matter. She said Major indeed behaved \u201cin a way that resulted in a minor injury\u201d to someone the previous day, and White House medical staff treated the person\u2019s wounds. Here was her quote, according to C-SPAN video: Champ and Major, the president and first lady\u2019s dogs, members of the family, are still getting acclimated and accustomed to their new surroundings and new people. And on Monday, the first family\u2019s younger dog, Major, was surprised by an unfamiliar person and reacted in a way that resulted in a minor injury to the individual, which was handled by the White House medical unit with no further treatment needed. In other words, the White House did not explicitly confirm CNN\u2019s reporting that Major bit someone (as opposed to scratching or tripping them), or that the victim supposedly held the job of White House security officer. Additionally, Psaki said the dogs indeed traveled to Delaware this week, though she made it seem like the trip was unrelated to the above-described incident that injured someone. Rather, she claimed, prior to Major\u2019s outburst, the Bidens were planning to drop off the dogs in Delaware temporarily so the politicians could travel and work. \u201cIt had been previously planned already for the dogs to be cared for by family and friends in Delaware during Dr. Biden\u2019s travels to military bases this week \u2014 she has a three-day trip this week \u2014 and the dogs will return to the White House soon,\u201d Psaki said. A Twitter account dedicated to the whereabouts of \u201cThe First Dogs of the United States\u201d posted: Snopes reached out to the White House for a more detailed explanation of what happened between Major and the stranger on March 8, as well as for a specific date for when the dogs would return to the White House. We have not received a response, but we will update this report when, or if, we do. Here\u2019s the dogs\u2019 backstory: Major was dropped off at the Delaware Humane Association (DHA) as a puppy after the rescue organization said something \u201ctoxic\u201d in his previous home put his health in danger. While walking with the dogs on Valentine\u2019s Day, the president told reporters the family decided to adopt the young dog (the first White House shelter dog) so their older German shepherd \u2014 13-year-old Champ \u2014 would have a companion and remain active in his senior years, according to a C-SPAN recording of the exchange. \u201cThey\u2019re buddies,\u201d Joe Biden said. Furthermore, one person told CNN for the March 2021 report, titled \u201cBiden\u2019s German Shepherd has aggressive incident and is sent back to Delaware,\u201d that the two dogs like to remain together, which would explain why they traveled as a pair. The bite rumor was not the first to broadcast the famous dogs\u2019 antics, whether alleged or confirmed. The previous fall, for example, Biden suffered a hairline fracture in his right foot while playing with Major, requiring him to temporarily wear an orthopedic boot. Then, in the days before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, the DHA celebrated Major\u2019s ascension in American politics with a virtual \u201cIndoguration\u201d party and fundraiser. Weeks later, in February, Jill Biden said in an interview for \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d that she was obsessed with making sure the dogs felt settled in their new home. \u201cThey have to take the elevator, they\u2019re not used to that, and they have to go out on the South Lawn with lots of people watching them,\u201d the first lady said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been obsessed with, getting everybody settled and calm.\u201d In sum, while a Biden official said one of the family\u2019s dogs injured someone at the White House on March 8, no evidence besides the CNN report citing anonymous sources confirmed the injury was a result of a bite. Additionally, the official claimed the dogs\u2019 trip to Delaware was a result of Jill Biden\u2019s work schedule \u2014 not a consequence of the dogs\u2019 actions.",

        "doc": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share \u201cThe Trump administration has awarded more than $50 billion in new federal contracts to companies that continue to shutter U.S. factories as they seek cheaper labor abroad.\u201d \u2014 tweet by Indiana Democratic Party, Feb. 5 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight We spotted this tweet and followed a link to an opinion article that attacked President Trump for betraying American voters for failing to take action against companies that offshore U.S. jobs. The article, by Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of labor-backed Good Jobs Nation, cited a study by the group that included the statistic in the tweet. We wondered about this claim, given that we had recently concluded that the president had \"some bragging rights\u201d to boast about companies returning jobs to the United States. Good Jobs Nation has promoted its study with tweets similar to the one above, labeling Trump as \u201cOffshorer-in-chief.\u201d Advertisement So let\u2019s take a look at the study that formed the basis of the tweet. The Facts The Good Jobs Nation report, titled \u201cBroken Promise #2,\u201d was issued in August. It noted that Trump had pledged on \u201cday one\u201d to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to stop. It\u2019s so easy,\u201d he said at a campaign rally Nov. 7, 2016. But the report, by George Faraday, legal and policy director for Good Jobs Nation, argues that the president has failed to crack down on companies that feast on big U.S. contracts and yet continue to ship some jobs overseas. The Labor Department has a program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), originally enacted in the 1960s to assist workers whose jobs were displaced by free trade agreements. Faraday studied the jobs certified as being shipped to another country and then crosschecked with data on federal contract awards posted on usaspending.gov. (Correction: an earlier version of this article said TAA dated to the enactment of North American Free Trade Agreement; there was a related program called the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program.) Advertisement He concluded that, as of June 8, major contractors had earned $52 billion contracts and had shipped more than 13,000 jobs offshore. Most of the list consists of 12 companies that received about $48 billion in contracts, with the biggest job losers led by General Motors, Boeing, United Technologies and Siemens. In a recent blog post, Faraday provided updated numbers, as of Jan. 24: $115 billion in federal contracts and 15,000 jobs shipped overseas. The overall numbers add up in the report and a spot check of the data indicates it is sound. (We have questions about the yearly rate data, putting Trump at a disadvantage, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this fact check.) So what\u2019s wrong? It provides only half of the picture. We had noted before that data from the Reshoring Initiative shows that companies started to return jobs to the United States \u2014 or other countries invested in the United States \u2014 during the Obama administration, but the trend really started to pick up in 2017. About 73,000 jobs were brought to the United States in 2015, 113,000 in 2016 and 171,000 in 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office. That\u2019s a gain of more than 50 percent between 2016 and 2017. Advertisement Looking at the TAA numbers, one sees a similar decline in workers who were certified as having lost jobs because they were shipped overseas. We calculated there were 126,165 lost in 2016, Obama\u2019s last year in office, and then 85,482 lost in 2017 and 78,514 lost in 2018. Obama had two better years, in 2014 and 2015, but otherwise overall losses were higher in every other year of his administration \u2014 including 214,125 in 2010 and 244,617 in 2009. Certainly the pattern of the past three years shows fewer jobs are being shipped overseas. Combined with more jobs being returned, that\u2019s a pretty positive trend line. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting point,\u201d acknowledged Faraday, but he said the group was focused on the losses, not the gains. \u201cWe\u2019re labor, and that how\u2019s we see the world.\u201d He said it was important that the jobs be returned to the communities that had lost them. Advertisement Faraday noted that the focus of the report was on companies that benefited from U.S. contracts. He said that Trump could have taken action, via an executive order, to punish companies that shipped jobs overseas but that the president had failed to do so. The top executives of five companies that had offshored jobs, according to the TAA data, were members of Trump\u2019s American Manufacturing Council, which the president later disbanded. Still, a number of companies on the list have also said they will bring jobs back from overseas or add jobs in the United States, according to news reports. AT&T, for instance, is listed in Faraday\u2019s report as offshoring 270 jobs since Trump became president. Yet in 2017, the company announced an agreement with the Communications Workers of America to bring back 3,000 jobs that had been sent to Mexico. (The CWA, in a report in January, charged that the company has continued to close call centers in the United States and lay off workers.) \u201cAT&T is abiding by our agreement for hiring in the Southwest, but still continues laying off workers and offshoring throughout the company,\u201d said Beth Allen, a CWA spokeswoman. The Pinocchio Test As regular readers know, context is important. If the glass is half full, you can\u2019t look at only the empty part. A more balanced presentation in the report would include the jobs that have been returned from overseas, not just the ones that are lost.

        "doc": "Is acid rain coming down over Ohio farmlands? Social media posts claim this is an effect of the response to the Feb. 3 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. A woman in a Feb. 19 Facebook video claimed that vinyl chloride carried on the train came \"spewing\" and \"boiling\" out of the tank cars, and that\u2019s why responders had to burn the chemical. She instructed viewers to avoid drinking the water and to take topsoil samples. Some of the train\u2019s tank cars carried vinyl chloride; five of them derailed and posed a risk for explosion. To prevent this, responders conducted a controlled venting to release and burn the vinyl chloride. The woman in the video added: \"What\u2019s going on in Ohio is that there are 75,000 acres of farmland, fertile farmland, that are all now being poured down with acid rain.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video was originally posted on TikTok Feb. 17. So, is acid rain pouring down over Ohio because of the train\u2019s derailment? We found no proof of that. Here\u2019s what we know. Vinyl chloride is a colorless gas used primarily to make polyvinyl chloride or PVC, one of the world\u2019s most widely produced plastics. It is used in pipes, car parts and housewares. The Environmental Protection Agency said hydrogen chloride was released after the derailment during the controlled vinyl chloride burn. Vinyl chloride in the air can form hydrogen chloride, which could be incorporated into cloud, rain and fog water, thus forming a component of acid rain. (The EPA said acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents.) Because wind can blow acid rain\u2019s components over long distances, the chemical burn\u2019s aftermath could have affected people and land far beyond the derailment site. However, James Lee, an Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson, told USA Today that there has been no hydrochloric acid rain in Ohio. PolitiFact reached out to Lee, but he declined to comment. And Ohio Department of Agriculture Spokesperson Meghan Harshbarger told PolitiFact on Feb. 27 that the office had \"no reason to believe the train derailment has caused acid rain to pour down on farmland.\" If the pollutants that cause acid rain \u2014 sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide \u2014 react in the atmosphere and form fine sulfate and nitrate particles that can be inhaled, they can cause, or worsen, respiratory diseases in people, the EPA said. Acid rain can also harm fish and other wildlife. When acidic rainwater flows through soil, it can leach aluminum from soil clay particles and then flow into streams and lakes, where acid-sensitive plants and animals may live. Increase in soil sulfur levels can also affect uptake of minerals into herbage that can lead to ill health in livestock. The Cincinnati Enquirer also reported on this claim Feb. 17. Kevin Crist, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and the director of the Air Quality Center at Ohio University, told The Enquirer that acid rain could have formed after the controlled release and burn of chemicals Feb. 6. However, Crist also said that once the vinyl chloride stopped burning and once there was no longer a plume, it would \"dissipate pretty quick.\" Jana Houser, associate professor of Ohio State University\u2019s atmospheric science program, told PolitiFact that as soon as chemicals enter the atmosphere, they dilute as they mix with other atmospheric gases. Houser plotted trajectories for how air molecules in and around the incident site could have traveled Feb. 3, when the train derailed, and Feb. 6, when the controlled burn began. She concluded that the likelihood of producing a toxic acid rain is \"essentially nonexistent, especially not over Ohio.\" Houser also said that to have acid rain, there needs to be rain. Citing data from the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network, Houser said there was no rain in and around the derailment site from Feb. 3 to Feb. 8. By the time light rain fell Feb. 8, most of the chemicals released in the Feb. 6 controlled venting would have been gone, Houser said. As of Feb. 13, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency discontinued air monitoring for hydrogen chloride, saying the threat of vinyl chloride fire producing hydrogen chloride \"no longer exists.\" A Facebook post claimed that In Ohio, \"there are 75,000 acres of farmland, fertile farmland, that are all now being poured down with acid rain.\" The Ohio Department of Agriculture told PolitiFact it had no reason to believe the train derailment caused acid rain to pour down on farmland. An atmospheric scientist plotted trajectories for how air molecules in and around the incident site could have traveled when the train derailed and when the controlled burn began, and concluded that the likelihood of toxic acid rain in Ohio was \"essentially nonexistent.\" We rate this claim False. \u200b",

Months later, Trump said he delivered victory to DeSantis in his race against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate. \"I was all in for Ron, and he beat Gillum, but after the Race, when votes were being stolen by the corrupt Election process in Broward County, and Ron was going down ten thousand votes a day, along with now-Senator Rick Scott, I sent in the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys, and the ballot theft immediately ended, just prior to them running out of the votes necessary to win. I stopped his Election from being stolen,\" Trump wrote Nov. 10 on Truth Social. DeSantis narrowly beat Gillum, as confirmed by a recount, in 2018. Could Trump have called someone at the Justice Department in November 2018 about the election in Broward? It's possible; we have no way to fact-check that part of his statement. But we can debunk Trump's assertion that votes were being \"stolen\" in Broward and that he stopped the steal. Broward County Commissioner Steve Geller told PolitiFact he was at the Broward vote counting site on Election Day and visited a couple of times in the weeks following. \"Unless the federal agents were undercover and didn't identify themselves, there was nobody there saying, 'Yes we are from the FBI or CIA or federal bureau of stopping the steal,'\" Geller said. \"There was no 'steal' for him to have stopped,\" Geller said, referring to Trump. A Broward County Supervisor of Elections spokesperson said the office had \"no documentation of any federal law enforcement presence during the 2018 elections\" and no evidence of corruption. The FBI had no comment for us about Trump's statement. We emailed Trump's spokespeople to ask for his evidence to support his statement and got no reply. Sarah Isgur, a former spokesperson for the Justice Department under Trump, tweeted Nov. 11 that the former president's claim about intervening in the 2018 election \"never happened.\" After Trump's endorsement, DeSantis clobbered Putnam, the presumptive GOP frontrunner and two-time agriculture commissioner, in the 2018 gubernatorial primary, but barely squeaked out a victory against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee. Days after the general election, GOP activists protested outside the Broward Supervisor of Elections' vote counting center. (This fact-checker spent one day at the protests.) The races for governor, U.S. Senate and state agricultural commissioner all fell into such close margins that they triggered recounts, as Florida state law requires. In the days following the election, Trump made allegations of voter fraud in Broward that were echoed by then-Gov. Rick Scott, who was declared the winner of his 2018 Senate race after a recount. As Broward election officials continued to count ballots, Trump called the rising number of \"found\" votes the \"Broward Effect\" and tweeted that he would send lawyers to \"expose the fraud!\" But under state law, officials had until noon Saturday following the election to finish vote counting. About two weeks after the 2018 election, a recount confirmed that DeSantis won by about 32,000 votes, or 0.4%. PolitiFact found there were mistakes by Broward election officials in 2018. For example, Scott's campaign noted that days after the election, Broward mixed about 20 rejected provisional ballots in with about 200 legitimate ones. But that's not the same as fraud. Brenda Snipes, Broward elections supervisor at that time and a Democrat, had a history of errors, sluggish vote counting and lawsuits. But none of that meant Snipes \u2014 or anyone in her office \u2014 tried to steal an election or acted criminally. Snipes ultimately resigned. Days after the election, Scott asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the vote counting and announced he would sue Broward and Palm Beach election supervisors. In April 2020, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement released a six-page summary of an investigation into allegations of Democrats committing fraud in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and said it found \"no evidence of fraudulent intent.\" Three people associated with Florida's Democratic Party altered the submission deadlines on affidavits to correct signature issues on mail-in ballots. However, the people had changed the form in anticipation of a court ruling to allow rejected mail-in ballots to be counted. The investigation found the people \"had no intent to disseminate\" the form without the court's prior approval. Florida Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox said there was insufficient \"evidence to support prosecution\" in that case, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The Broward County auditor wrote a report in 2020 stating that the elections office in 2018 had exhibited poor planning and waste and he was \"unable to provide assurance over the accuracy\" of the results. But county commissioners and Peter Antonacci, who was appointed supervisor, pushed back on that conclusion. Antonacci said he agreed with individual audit findings but not the overall conclusion, and added that the findings \"do not change the outcome of any race,\" the Sun Sentinel reported. It is rare for federal law enforcement to investigate allegations of voter fraud. \"Most allegations of voter fraud are first brought to light by private attorneys hired by candidates, and then they go beg local authorities and maybe local authorities will pay attention if they think there is proof,\" said J.C. Planas, a Florida election lawyer and former Republican state legislator, who is now a Democrat. When voter fraud is alleged, it's typically in local races or primaries and not statewide general elections, Planas said. \"I have been doing this for a long time, and I have yet to see any credible allegation of fraud in a general election, because there is no way to do voter fraud without a voter's compliance,\" Planas said. We have found sporadic voter fraud convictions in recent years in Florida, but they are not orchestrated efforts to steal elections. They are generally people acting alone \u2014 for example, casting a mail ballot in the name of a dead relative. Also, the FBI coming to Broward would have generated news reports, Planas said. \"Trump may very well have called people,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean they showed up.\" Trump said in the 2018 Florida governor's race \"votes were being stolen by the corrupt election process in Broward. \u2026 I sent in the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys, and the ballot theft immediately ended. \u2026 I stopped his Election from being stolen.\" Trump did not support his statement with evidence. We don't know whether Trump called the Justice Department and asked it to investigate Broward's elections in November 2018, but we found no evidence of a federal investigation. State law enforcement investigated allegations of Democrats committing fraud in a few counties, including Broward, and found \"no evidence of fraudulent intent.\" DeSantis was declared the winner because he received the most votes, confirmed by a recount. We found no evidence of a criminal plot in Broward to \"steal\" the election from DeSantis. We rate this statement Pants on Fire! RELATED: Why does the Justice Department monitor polling sites?

        "claim": "The Congressional seats of almost three dozen Republicans who voted to repeal Obamacare were lost to Democrats in 2018.",
        "doc": "In late 2018, as new members of the U.S. Congress prepared to take office following the midterm elections, a meme circulated a claim on social media that a number of Republican legislators had been voted out of office after having supported a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. In the meme, red \u201cX\u2019 marks were drawn through the faces of 33 lawmakers who purportedly were rejected by voters in the 6 November 2018 midterm elections: Although memes are frequently grossly inaccurate, this one got the general idea and numbers correct (even if the persons actually pictured in the accompanying photograph are difficult or impossible to identify). By our count, at least 34 Republican legislators who voted to repeal or partially repeal Obamacare will not be returning to Congress when the new session begins in January 2019. Here\u2019s how the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) described votes in the House and Senate in May and June 2018 regarding health care: On May 4, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act by the razor-thin margin of 217-213. Those voting \u201cyes\u201d were voting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Senate did not adopt this legislation, so it never became law \u2026 On July 26, the U.S. Senate defeated a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by a vote of 51 to 49. Those voting \u201cyes\u201d were voting to partially repeal the ACA. Had this measure passed, it would have been the basis for negotiating a final bill with the House of Representatives. Not all of the non-returning legislators who cast votes against the ACA were \u201cvoted out\u201d in a literal sense, as some \u201cretired\u201d (i.e., didn\u2019t run for re-election) and saw their seats go to Democrats: House of Representatives Jason LewisErik PaulsonKevin YoderPete SessionsSteve RussellRod BlumDavid YoungRandy HultgrenPeter RoskamBruce PoliquinKeith RothfusMike BishopJeff DenhamSteve KnightMimi WaltersDana RorbacherMia LoveClaudia TenneyTom MacarthurCarlos CurbeloDave BratScott TaylorJohn FasoJohn CulbersonRodney Frelinghuysen (retired, seat flipped)Martha McSally (ran for U.S. Senate, seat flipped)Mark Sanford (retired, seat flipped)Dave Trott (retired, seat flipped)Darrell Issa (retired, seat flipped)Steve Pearce (retired, seat flipped)Ed Royce (retired, seat flipped) U.S. Senate Jeff Flake (retired, seat flipped)Dean Heller On the other hand, seven GOP House Members did not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act yet still saw their seats lost to Democrats: Barbara ComstockLeonard LanceDan DonovanMike CoffmanRyan Costello (retired, seat flipped)Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (retired, seat flipped)Frank LoBiondo (retired, seat flipped) Some commenters who went through the photograph used in the meme in microscopic detail to try to discern the identities behind the tiny faces obscured with red X\u2019s noted that they didn\u2019t all correspond to the (unnamed) members of Congress whose seats were lost after they voted to repeal the ACA: Kinda steps on your point when you get this many wrong.

(@mattdizwhitlock) November 17, 2018 Democrats needed to flip 23 Republican seats in the House of Representatives to gain majority control of that body, and they succeeded in doing so, with the latest tallies showing the Democratic party taking electoral victories from Republicans in 40 congressional districts nationwide. Although Republicans made gains in the U.S. Senate, Democratic candidates took seats formerly held by Republicans Jeff Flake and Dean Heller in Arizona and Nevada, respectively (both of whom had voted for the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of Obamacare).",

        "claim": "\"During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans, but because of the way districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did.\"",
        "doc": "The Democratic member of Congress from Austin, otherwise represented in Washington, D.C. by Republicans, says Democrats nationally got more votes in 2012 yet Republicans ended up with their House majority. \"During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans,\" Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a Nov. 4, 2013, talk at the University of Texas at San Antonio. \"But because of the way\" House \"districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did.\" The first part of his claim sounded familiar, but is it right that this outcome arose from the way House districts were designed? In every state, districts must be redrawn every 10 years to adjust for population changes as measured by the decennial U.S. census. Each state has its own method for drawing districts. And Texas, like most states, entrusts most of the line-drawing to state legislators. Over the past dozen years or so, Doggett pointed out in his talk, he has represented a variety of communities--at one time holding a district that stretched from the Texas-Mexico border north into Austin--largely due to how districts were drawn by the state\u2019s dominant Republicans. Nationally, he said, the redistricting process \"has had a significant impact on more than me and indeed on the whole framing of the national debate that is going on right now.\" His lecture later touched on the influence of money in politics. Doggett, who currently represents a district snaking south from Travis County into its base in San Antonio, told the university audience that Republican domination of redistricting in statehouses effectively helped the GOP maintain its House majority. To our inquiry, Doggett said by email: \"I spoke about a number of factors that explain the composition and conduct of the current Congress. Redistricting looms large among them as a very significant factor. Gerrymandering,\" district-drawing to partisan advantage, \"has only reinforced obstructionists.\" Doggett\u2019s spokeswoman, Kelsey Crow, sent an email pointing out an Oct. 14, 2013, NBC News report stating: \"When Republicans won the majority of statehouses in 2010, it ensured they would be redrawing the maps in those states. And lo and behold, it paid off in 2012. Nationwide, Democrats running for Congress got 1.1 million more votes, but Republicans sent 33 more members to the House.\" It\u2019s helpful to remember that the Republican margin of 33 seats means Democrats fell 17 victories short of capturing the House majority. Doggett\u2019s raw numbers were accurate. Democrats outpolled Republicans in the 2012 House races, but Republicans ended up with a 33-seat House majority. A December 2012 analysis by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan D.C. publication, said House Democrats out-drew their Republican counterparts by more than 1 million votes--1.37 million votes to be precise, Cook\u2019s House editor, David Wasserman, later calculated. Between the two parties, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the vote while winning 46 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. The Republican advantage was a decrease from the party\u2019s 49-seat majority in 2011-12; Democrats held House majorities from 2007 through 2010. But political scientists quibble over whether how districts were redrawn entirely explains the GOP majority. (This is a good time to take a gulp of water/beverage of your preference). Writing in December 2012, Wasserman pointed to two \"unprecedented\" factors that explained the GOP\u2019s House grip: the thick concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and the GOP\u2019s wide control of drawing congressional districts. Other analyses similarly support redistricting as a reason, but some political scientists suggest other factors were more significant such as the advantages enjoyed by Republicans seeking re-election as incumbents. Even before the 2012 elections, Republican influence over redistricting looked likely to be significant. A George Mason University political scientist, Michael McDonald, who later worked as an expert in a Texas Democratic Party challenge to how Republicans drew districts in Texas, noted in a April 2011 article published by the American Political Science Association that thanks to election results in 2010 and earlier, Republicans would dominate redistricting in more states than Democrats. Among the 43 states with more than one congressional district, he wrote, six would rely on bipartisan commissions to draw new districts, 16 would have Republicans in control, six would have Democrats in charge and 15 would act as a divided government. But different sometimes complex methods of analyzing the 2012 results generate different conclusions about the effects of the line-drawing, though all point to Republicans benefiting most: --On Nov. 8, 2012, Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog compared how well Democratic President Barack Obama fared in 2012 in most of the states where Republicans controlled redistricting leading up to the election year compared with how Democrats running for House seats came out. In Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Pennsylvania, Matthews wrote, Democrats won clutches of seats as Obama prevailed statewide: \"In Virginia, for instance, 27 percent of seats went to Democrats, while Obama got 52 percent of the vote. In Pennsylvania, 28 percent of seats went to Democrats, and Obama won 53 percent.\" There was balance in two states, Matthews wrote: \"Utah gave a quarter of its vote to Obama and a quarter of its House seats to Democrats and New Hampshire sent two Democrats to the House despite Obama's only having a six-point margin there.\" --Just before the 2012 elections, an Oct. 25, 2012, preliminary study by the Brennan Center for Justice, part of the New York University School of Law, concluded that the way districts were drawn would give Republican hopefuls six seats more than they would have won if the election was carried out under the previous district lines. After the elections, a center analyst, Sundeep Iyer, wrote that the prediction mostly held up because five seats flipped from a Democrat to a Republican due to redistricting, he wrote, while six Republican-held seats were saved by redistricting. \"In states where Republicans controlled redistricting,\" Iyer said, \"Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats.\" Then again, Iyer wrote, \"even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats.\" Still, Iyer said, where Democrats held redistricting sway, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, while Republicans lost five additional seats. --Another proponent of the \"redistricting matters\" school, Princeton University neuroscientist and election forecaster Sam Wang, described how partisans can make the line-drawing work to their partisan advantage in a Feb. 2, 2013, opinion column in the New York Times. \"Gerrymandering is not hard,\" Wang wrote. \"The core technique is to jam voters likely to favor your opponents into a few throwaway districts where the other side will win lopsided victories, a strategy known as \u2018packing.\u2019 Arrange other boundaries to win close victories, \u2018cracking\u2019 opposition groups into many districts.\" By his own methodology, Wang estimated that redistricting cost Democrats 15 House seats in the 2012 elections. --Earlier, Washington University post-doctoral student Nicholas Goedert, said in a Nov. 15, 2012, post on the Monkey Cage blog, founded in 2007 to publicize research by political scientists, that redistricting most likely cost Democrats seven races nationally. Likewise, political scientists John Sides and Eric McGhee said redistricting cost Democrats seven seats, writing that they reached their figure by looking at what would have happened if the election took place in the pre-2012 House districts. \"This\" seven \"is not nothing, but it\u2019s far less than what the Democrats needed to take back the House,\" the two wrote in a Feb. 17, 2013, commentary on the Wonkblog. Sides and McGhee concluded that once they considered the effect of incumbency on the 2012 results, the seeming pro-Republican impact of gerrymandering vanished. \"That is, the ability of Republicans to retain the House majority may have been due to incumbency advantage, not new and more favorable districts,\" they wrote. Conversely, they wrote, removing the percentage point gains attributable to incumbency generated results indicating that Democrats would have won 219 seats, \"virtually eliminating\" any GOP advantage traced to redistricting. By telephone, McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, said Republicans nationally pulled off \"spectacular gerrymanders\" before the 2012 elections. \"But there\u2019s no clear evidence that there\u2019s been this systematic ability of Republicans to draw better districts going way back on a national scale,\" McGhee said. With help from Keesha Gaskins of the Brennan Center, we queried others who have weighed in on redistricting and the 2012 results, among them University of Chicago law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, who said by email that he thinks Doggett got it right, but reaching that conclusion depends on whether one interprets his statement as speaking to redistricting over more than the past couple years. \"It's clear that the party preferred by a minority of voters won a majority of seats in 2012,\" Stephanapoulos said. \"Whether this is because of redistricting depends entirely on what your benchmark is. If your benchmark is proportional representation for each party, then it's clear that redistricting (together with single-member districts) is to blame. If your benchmark is the districts that were in place before the latest round of redistricting, then redistricting may only have won the Republicans 11 seats\u2026.But the districts in place before 2012 themselves were drawn by legislatures, and most observers thought the pre-2012 districts already favored Republicans in several states.\" Next, we ran the range of these analyses past Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff, who has advised legislative leaders about redistricting issues since the 1970s. Bickerstaff said by phone that the Republicans\u2019 majority isn\u2019t due solely to how districts were designed. \"It\u2019s more complicated,\" Bickerstaff said. Our ruling Doggett said Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans in 2012 but because of the way districts are designed, Republicans got 33 more House seats. Democratic House nominees drew nearly 1.4 million more votes than Republicans and the GOP landed a 33-seat House majority. Redistricting was a major factor in that result, but experts also diverge over whether how districts were designed was the key driver. Incumbency and the concentration of Democrats in congested cities also have been aired as significant. We rate Doggett\u2019s statement, which lacks this clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",

        "claim": "Says small businesses \"make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce\" and \"almost never receive a penny of government money.\"",
        "doc": "Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran continued his scorched-earth campaign against taxpayer-backed business incentives, this time attacking Gov. Rick Scott for spending too much time defending Enterprise Florida and not enough time on issues that protect jobs. In an April 3 Tampa Bay Times column, Corcoran warned that not addressing the state's workers' compensation system and a property insurance issue known as \"assignment of benefits\" will put small and family-run businesses in jeopardy. Corcoran said that instead of working with the House on these issues, Scott has spent most of the 60-day legislative session fighting for an agency that doesn\u2019t help small businesses. \"(Enterprise Florida) subsidizes big companies with over 1,000 employees to compete against our small businesses, which make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce and who almost never receive a penny of government money,\" Corcoran wrote. For this fact-check, we decided to focus on the statistics about small businesses in Florida and whether they \"almost never\" receive government money. Regardless of how you define them, small businesses make up a large chunk of all businesses in Florida. However, his point that small businesses \"almost never\" receive government money is at best an exaggeration. Small businesses not so small in Florida There is no standard definition for a small business. The difference between large and small firms can depend on how many people a firm employs, the amount of revenue the firm makes or the type of industry. No matter which way you slice the pie, small businesses in Florida comprise a significant chunk of all business in the Sunshine State. Florida is home to approximately 2.4 million businesses of all sizes. That figure includes large firms, small firms and nonemployer firms \u2014 a technical term to describe a business with no employees. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals whose business may or may not be the main source of income, such as someone who earns money as a tutor. Nonemployers make up 81.5 percent of all businesses in the state. The latest snapshot comes from the federal government. The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy considers a small business as any firm with fewer than 500 employees (including the nonemployers). Under that metric, the total number of small businesses is about 2.3 million. That comes out to 99.8 percent of all businesses, an even larger share than Corcoran\u2019s figure. Corcoran got to his figure of 98.9 percent by excluding firms without a single employee. The figure came from a report that divided the number of firms with fewer than 500 employees (almost 420,000) with the total of firms with employees (424,550). To throw out another measure that still proves the prevalence of small businesses, firms with fewer than 20 employees make up about 90 percent of all businesses in the state. Corcoran\u2019s point about small businesses employing \"nearly half\" of the workforce is slightly above the actual figure. The latest number shows that small businesses (defined as fewer than 500 employees) employed 3.2 million people. That is about 42.8 percent of the workforce. Kwame Donaldson, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s, said that compared to the national average, small businesses in Florida employ a smaller share of the workforce (43 percent in Florida vs. 48 percent nationwide). Are small businesses getting gypped? Corcoran said small businesses \"almost never\" get government money. Corcoran\u2019s team pointed to a December 2016 review of Enterprise Florida\u2019s economic development system by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, a nonpartisan research arm of the Legislature. The analysis found that the majority of businesses incentives (51.9 percent) went to employers with more than 1,000 employees. The analysis pointed out that businesses with less than 50 employees received only 14.5 percent of economic incentives. \"Although 96 percent of the state\u2019s businesses employ fewer than 50 employees, most state-level economic development programs, particularly incentives, generally benefit large businesses,\" it reads. Here\u2019s the breakdown: If we consider a small business as a firm between 1 and 499 employees, as Corcoran did for the other part of his point, then small businesses were awarded 38.3 percent of economic incentives. That\u2019s not as much as the big firms got, but it\u2019s not \"almost nothing.\" Our ruling Corcoran said small businesses \"make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce\" and \"almost never receive a penny of government money.\" No matter the definition, small businesses in Florida make up the majority of all businesses in the state. Corcoran\u2019s specific numbers are accurate if a small business is defined as any firm with fewer than 500 employees. However, by that 500-employee metric, it is not the case that small businesses \"almost never\" receive government money. While large firms get the majority of incentives, firms that employ between 1 to 499 people in Florida were awarded almost 40 percent of all incentive projects in past years. So while large firms receive the majority of economic incentives, it is imprecise to say there\u2019s \"almost nothing\" left for the little guy. For a partially accurate claim that requires explanation, we rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "\"The bill reported out of committee sets up a $50 billion slush fund that, while intended for resolving failing firms, is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit.\"",
        "doc": "Now that the health care debate has come to a close, lawmakers are prepping their talking points for the next looming battle: financial institution reform.Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on his chamber's Banking Committee, aired his grievances in a March 25, 2010, letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The letter was largely prompted by Shelby's concern that in a recent speechGeithnermischaracterized the senator'ssupport for financial regulation. Shelby also took the opportunity to point outseveralways that he believesthe legislation his committee recently approved is flawed. \"The bill reported out of committee sets up a $50 billion slush fund that, while intended for resolving failing firms, is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit,\" Shelby wrote on March 25, 2010. \"Nonetheless, the mere existence of this fund will make it all too easy to choose bailout over bankruptcy. This can only reinforce the expectation that the government stands ready to intervene on behalf of large and politically connected financial institutions at the expense of Main Street and the American taxpayer. Therefore, the bill institutionalizes 'too big to fail.' \"We wondered whether Shelby is correct about a fund that can be used for whatever purpose the treasury secretary sees fit. First, the details of the bill. On March 22, 2010, the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sens. Christopher Dodd and Shelby, approved the overhaul by a party-line vote of 13-10. Highlights include new government authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds, a new consumer financial product regulator within the Federal Reserve, and a process for dissolving institutions that are teetering on collapse. The \"Orderly Liquidation Fund\" is the technical term for the $50 billion pot of money Shelby is concerned about. Only the largest firms would be required to pay into the fund. If a \"systematically significant\" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to use the fund to liquidate the firm. A panel of three bankruptcy judges would have to convene and agree within 24 hours that the company is insolvent. The fund is not meant to replace the bankruptcy process, but ratherto provide a sort of emergency mechanism for the government to deal with very large, economically significant institutions.So, the bill provides quite a bit of structure around how the government would decide which firms should be dissolved.Shelby is clearly correct on his first point that there is a $50 billion fund in the bill (we'll leave the debate over the definition of \"slush fund\" for another day) that's \"intended to resolve failing firms.\" The second part of his claim is that the fund is available for \"virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit.\" First -- because we like to split hairs -- we should note that, while the bill says that the fund will be established in the Treasury Department, it will be administered by the FDIC, an independent branch of government, not the Treasury Department. Whether the money can be used for anything the government wants is another matter. The legislative language is pretty clear that the money must be used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says:\"In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.\"The fund cannot be used to keep faltering institutions alive. What about bonuses? \"It certainly cannot be used for bonuses or salaries going forward,\" said Dana Chasin, legislative and policy liaison for the Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of generally left-leaning groups in support of financial regulatory reform. By definition, the fund would be used to dissolve companies all together; management would be summarily forced out in the process. However, it is possible that \"costs associated with liquidation could involve claims''for prior compensation agreements held by the company, which could involve bonuses, Chasin conceded. \"There are certain kinds of contracts that may or may not be repudiated,\" he said. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says he's concerned about how the money might be used, but the bigger issue may be limited standing for anyone to file a suit to prevent misuse of the fund.\"A similar problem developed under the TARP legislation -\u2013 under which GM and Chrysler got funding although no serious analyst argued that they were 'financial institutions,' as required under TARP,\" Gattuso wrote to us in an e-mail. \"There simply was no judicial review of the action available, because no entity had the requisite standing. A similar problem could develop under this legislation.\"David Zaring, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, said that the bill does seem to give the government some leeway in reinterpreting the fund in the future through the rulemaking process. \"Shelby may be concerned because the bill gives [the government] modest rulemaking authority on how it construes the fund and some opportunities to reinterpret it,\" he said. \"However, that rulemaking authority is limited. I don't see any sort of blank check in that.\" So, when it comes to the fund, it's clear that it can only be used to cover costs associated with shutting down a firm altogether, not to keep a firm afloat. But several of the people we spoke with pointed out that the bill is a bit vague in some areas, at least in their view. And indeed, the bill provides some flexibility in how funds are used during liquidation. That said, it's an overstatement for Shelby to say that the fund \"is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit.\" We also take issue with Shelby's underlying point, that the fund somehow encourages firms to take a bailout rather than bankruptcy. In fact, the rules of the fund dictate that it not be used to maintain companies that are bad for our financial system, but rather to shut down those companies altogether, a process akin to bankruptcy. Shelby also implies that the fund comes at a cost to taxpayers,sayingthe fund \"can only reinforce the expectation that the government stands ready to intervene on behalf of large and politically connected financial institutions at the expense of Main Street and the American taxpayer.\" But remember, the businesses would pay into the liquidation fund, not taxpayers. The bill is very specific about that. So his underlying point hereis incorrect.Shelby is right that the bill would create a $50 billion fund to help dismantle very large, faltering firms.While there may be just a bit of wiggle room on what costs the fund covers,the bill makes it clear that the money must be used to liquidate -- not keep alive -- failing firms. Also, the program is administered by the FDIC, andbefore it can step in to dismantle a firm, FDIC must haveagreement ofthe Treasury, the Federal Reserve and three bankruptcy judges.So, to say that the fund \"is available for virtually any purpose that the Treasury Secretary sees fit,\" is more than a stretch.We find Shelby's claim to be False.",

        "doc": "An effort ordered by Gov. Rick Scott to purge Florida\u2019s voter rolls of noncitizens had Sen. Bill Nelson feeling a sour case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Nelson, a Democrat, links the hunt for illegal voters with the 2000 election -- before anyone even uttered the word \"recount\" -- and Florida\u2019s botched attempt to remove felons from the rolls ahead of election day.He warned Scott about repeating the ordeal in a May 29, 2012, letter.\"In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons,\" Nelson wrote. \"Many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not. And in a presidential election decided by 537 votes, that erroneous purge may have been a factor.\"PolitiFact Florida wanted to compare the millennial purge with the most recent one, which the Obama administration ordered the state to halt on grounds it violates two voter laws.We\u2019ll examine the parallels and determine if Nelson offered an accurate recap of the number of voters affected by the infamous 2000 purge.2000As part of their 1998 elections reforms, state lawmakers told the Department of State to remove felons and other ineligible voters from the rolls after thousands of corrupt votes, including 100 votes by felons, were cast in a Miami mayoral election.The agency hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies, a subsidiary of ChoicePoint in Atlanta, for about $4 million to produce a list of probable and possible felons before the election. (Unlike most states, in Florida a felon\u2019s civil rights are not restored unless he or she is granted clemency by the governor and Cabinet.)The company warned the state that many people on the list would not be felons, but officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters -- that meant more felons off the rolls.People whose names appeared on the list of more than 50,000 names had to prove their innocence or automatically be dropped from the rolls within several weeks of receiving written notice. Twenty counties ignored the state\u2019s directive because they found the data unreliable, including the Madison County elections supervisor, who found her own name among suspected felon voters.News organizations unearthed numerous accounts of law-abiding citizens turned away at the polls because they could not prove their innocence. Several thousand people appealed to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and half were found to not be felons.The precise damage is pretty hard to calculate.\"I\u2019ve seen numbers all over the map,\" said Myrna Perez, senior counsel in the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is investigating the purge ordered by Scott.Nelson\u2019s figure comes from a 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation, the crux of which asserts at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged before the 2000 election -- \"the collateral damage from an aggressive and ill-conceived state plan to prevent felons from voting.\"The Post\u2019s count included at least 108 citizens who were cleared after the election and 996 people who committed felonies in other states (they were supposed to retain their civil rights even in Florida).Other tallies put the number of bad targets 11 or 20 times higher.The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000 partly over the felon voter purge, arguing it disenfranchised black voters. A consent decree from the lawsuit settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards.The exercise resulted in 12,023 fewer Floridians making the felon list, meaning these people could have been targeted as felons and denied the right to vote, reported the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) in 2003.Some caveats: This figure does not mean 12,000 people were purged without cause. It means they could have been. Plus, some people within this class might not have been affected anyway because some supervisors decided not to enforce the purge.A massive story about the 2000 election by Vanity Fair identified 20,000 people who were wrongly included. We don\u2019t know where that number comes from and will update this story if we find out.Nelson should have used that much bigger figure, said Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho.\"I read the letter from Nelson and I laughed,\" Sancho said. \"How come you didn\u2019t vet this better? You could have had a way bigger number.\"We asked the state department for any data it might have but did not hear back.2012Twelve years later, Gov. Scott, who campaigned on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigrants, ordered state officials to clear the rolls of noncitizen voters.The state department whittled a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens to about 2,700 by comparing driver\u2019s license data, which contains some citizenship data, against voter rolls. County supervisors, again, were told to notify those listed by mail of the need to urgently prove their citizenship. And also like last time, some supervisors decided to sit out the purge.Already, a Pasco County woman and a 91-year-old World War II veteran from Broward County have made headlines for being wrongfully targeted. In fact, elections supervisors found that most names on the list belong to citizens -- probably because the motor vehicle department\u2019s citizenship information is out of date, the Miami Herald reported.Thirteen Miami-Dade residents have disclosed they are not citizens and ineligible to vote as a result of the purge, the Herald reported. It\u2019s for reasons like this that Republicans stand by the clean-up efforts.\"The implication of Nelson's letter is that eligible voters will not be able to vote, yet there is no evidence of this,\" said Kristen McDonald, RPOF spokeswoman.Still, voter-rights advocates and some elections supervisors share Nelson\u2019s ominous sentiment.\"It\u2019s distressing and disheartening that this is happening again in Florida given the history of inaccurate voter purges of the past,\" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project, which is a program within the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.Rolling Stone waded into the issue with a scathing report, quoting Sancho as saying, \"The state\u2019s supervisors of elections are very, very disturbed.\"\"This was dumped into our laps at the 11th hour. Those of us who have been here long enough get this eerie similarity to the flawed felon databases of 2000 in Florida,\" he told the magazine.Our rulingNelson precisely cites a Palm Beach Post analysis that put the total number of people wrongfully dropped from the voter rolls in 2000 at about 1,100. Other estimates of wrongful targets are much higher, and experts about the 2000 election tend to go with those. Trouble is, we don\u2019t have exact figures.However, Nelson\u2019s broader point -- that a significant number of people were wrongly tossed from Florida\u2019s voter rolls -- is valid. And he did say at least.We rate his statement True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the 2012 election season. See video fact-checks by clicking here.",

        "claim": "If the state turns down money for high-speed rail, it will \"kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs.\"",
        "doc": "The debate over the proposed high-speed rail line from Milwaukee to Madison percolated during the campaign for governor. It flared up on the eve of the election, and has raged since Republican Scott Walker was elected Nov. 2, 2010.Walker wants the project stopped, even if it means rejecting $810 million in already-approved federal money. After state officials signed contracts in a pre-election push to ensure the project moves forward, outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle has backed off -- but argues ending the project will cost taxpayers $100 million.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker, has said the city will consider legal options if the train is killed. Virtually everyone has entered the fight, often wielding statistics to argue their point. That includes the Sierra Club\u2019s Wisconsin chapter.Weapon of choice: Jobs.In a news release and a petition, the Sierra Club argues if the state turns down money for high speed rail, it will \"kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs.\"If PolitiFact had sound effects, we\u2019d add a loud whistle here.As in, that\u2019s a lot of jobs.And as in, let\u2019s have a timeout and get to the bottom of this.Many different job-related statistics have been bandied about in the debate.The state Department of Transportation estimates there are the 13,719 jobs involved in construction, engineering, design and train manufacturing tied to the project.On the campaign trail, Walker argued the project would create only 55 permanent jobs, declaring in an open letter to President Barack Obama on his notrain.com web site: \"That\u2019s $14.5 million per job, not including any hidden costs!\"There, Walker is talking about jobs on the train line itself -- conductors, engineers, ticket-takers and the like. In making the claim, he is purposely choosing the smallest possible number to make his point.But what of the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs claimed by the Sierra Club and others, some of whom are now citing the Sierra Club as the source of the number? These are jobs not tied directly to the project and as such are hardest to measure hardest to quantify.Yet the group offers a very specific number: 9,572.The number comes from a 2006 economicanalysis prepared for Amtrak and nine states, including Wisconsin, a group called the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. The study, prepared by Transportation & Economics Management Systems, became part of the state\u2019s application for the train funding.The study says: \"The development of the system integrates so many communities, and provides such a wide reaching impact that it will generate on its own a 0.1 percent growth to the region\u2019s economy.\"The sweeping conclusion:\"It will support existing manufacturing and service industries and will foster the growth of new small businesses across the Midwest because of the improved access between communities. It will encourage large businesses to distribute their operations more widely across the Midwest and reap the benefit of providing more efficient \u2018back shop\u2019 operations in the highly accessible smaller communities.\"OK, but how do you quantify all that?If you dig into the study, you find it is based on numerous assumptions and applies multipliers and other formulas to come up with a bottom line: Expanded train service would create 58,000 jobs in the nine states, boost property values by $5 billion and increase urban household income by $1 billion.Let\u2019s look at some of the factors and underlying assumptions, with an eye toward how the Sierra Club and others are using them when they claim 10,000 permanent jobs are at stake with the Milwaukee to Madison line.Size of the systemThe numbers are based on the prospect of a fully-built system throughout the Midwest. That is, it\u2019s not just high-speed rail from Milwaukee to Madison, but Chicago all the way to Minneapolis. And Chicago to St. Louis. And ultimately connections to Omaha, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and more.It even includes a spur to Green Bay, with proposed stations in Menomonee Falls, Fond du Lac, Neenah and Appleton. That piece alone accounts for 3,200 jobs in the study, some of which overlap with the Milwaukee jobs.But the federal funds allocated so far only cover some pieces of the plan.And there is no certainty the full system will ever be built -- in Ohio, Governor-elect John Kasich has vowed to block the Cleveland to Cincinnati to Columbus piece.So, even if Walker were to have a change of heart, the system may be smaller and have fewer connections, which could mean its jobs impact is smaller as well.Jobs gained, jobs lostThe study suggests that new jobs and opportunities will develop around the new route, as more people take advantage of the high-speed connections. However, as people board the train they are taken off the highways and don\u2019t as often take to the skies.But the study counts only the new jobs, not any lost ones.\"How many airline pilots or contractors renovating terminals will not be needed?\" said Steven E. Polzin, of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, an expert on rail proposals, whose group has been criticized for favoring cars and roads. \"How many auto workers, gas station attendants, road contractors, etc.\"So, part of the equation is missing.Stations as economic hubsThe study assumes that stations will become economic hubs, prompting other businesses to create jobs nearby. But the stations envisioned are no sure thing.For instance, the initial Madison station was to be near the airport -- not ideal for someone headed to the Capitol. Now it\u2019ll be in the city center, but going into the city slows down a traveler from Milwaukee to Minneapolis. Leaders of some cities, including Brookfield and Wauwatosa, have said they don\u2019t even want a proposed station.So, more uncertainty.Other travel optionsIf the price of gas remains relatively low, there will be less incentive for travelers to get out of their cars and board the train. Indeed, cars may be able to make the trip faster -- assuming there\u2019s no traffic congestion. Initial train speeds are planned to be 79 miles an hour, not including stops; the train would run at higher speeds later.Whats more, Mitchell International Airport is enjoying an air carrier -- and airfare -- war, which has helped it attract more passengers than ever. There is no telling how long that will last, but low air fares could have an impact on who grabs the train.Polzin, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin, said it appeared to be professionally done, using methods that are generally accepted.He noted that such studies are usually done to build support for a project \"and look exclusively at the benefits of the specific option, not the comparative benefits of other options or directing those resources to others purposes.\"Indeed, the state Department of Transportation has not highlighted the 10,000 permanent jobs figure, focusing instead on construction-related jobs for the Milwaukee-to-Madison line.\"That\u2019s work that we did ourselves,\" said Cari Anne Renlund, executive assistant for the state DOT. \"We need to talk about what we know is real.\"We\u2019ll leave Projection Land and return to reality as well.The Sierra Club\u2019s Wisconsin chapter and others say killing the high-speed train will kill jobs, specifically 9,572 permanent ones. Their number is taken from a professional analysis, but that analysis is based on a host of assumptions -- including that an entire Midwest network is built -- many of which could change. And while the Sierra Club suggests the jobs are an immediate loss, the report itself puts them years into the future.The Truth-O-Meter isn\u2019t a crystal ball. But it\u2019s got a present-day rating that fits this claim: Barely True. (Note: Paragraph three of this item was changed on Nov. 16, 2010 to more closely reflect what Mayor Barrett has said in regard to the train and the city's options.)",

Advertisement Older generations of Americans were much less inclined to have the government censor speech that offends minorities, Pew found. When combining all age groups, 28 percent of Americans said the government should ban this type of speech, while 67 percent said people should be able to offend minorities in public. \u201cTwo-thirds of Americans say this, compared with a median of 35 percent among the 38 nations we polled,\u201d wrote Jacob Poushter, a senior researcher at Pew. The bottom line is that there\u2019s a gulf between what Sasse described and what the Pew poll actually shows. As any pollster will tell you, the specific wording of survey questions can greatly influence the results. So in crafting poll questions and in describing the answers people gave, precision is key. According to Sasse, 40 percent of Americans under age 35 said the First Amendment was \u201cdangerous.\u201d But Pew didn\u2019t even mention the First Amendment or the word \u201cdangerous.\u201d Had it mentioned either, the poll results might have turned out differently. Advertisement Instead, Pew asked about \u201cstatements that are offensive to minority groups\u201d and the specific question was, \u201cDo you think people should be able to say these types of things publicly OR the government should be able to prevent people from saying these things in some circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018in some circumstances\u2019 phrase really softens it,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cWe have limits on First Amendment rights \u2018in some circumstances\u2019 for quite a few situations. So it\u2019s hard to see how this is a danger.\u201d Another point: Sasse says the risk at hand is that people in general might experience hurt feelings because of what they hear. But the Pew poll asked about statements that offend minority groups. (Murray said he wouldn\u2019t be too bothered by this flub.) Each senator was allotted five minutes or so to question Zuckerberg. A spokesman for Sasse, James Wegmann, said the senator was trying to convey his point quickly. Advertisement \u201cI think that the obvious implication of the poll is that 40 percent of Americans under the age of 35 say that the First Amendment right to say offensive things is dangerous enough to curtail it,\u201d Wegmann said. \u201cThe senator\u2019s point was to quickly cut to the chase that (a) some folks talk a lot about the psychological categories around speech, (b) this is messy (as free speech issues often are and as admitted by Zuckerberg when he said it was hard to define \u2018hate speech\u2019), and (c) this isn\u2019t a conversation that\u2019s just happening in Facebook but in a broader cultural context.\u201d But poll results are sensitive to the specific way questions are phrased \u2014 and a lot was lost in translation because Sasse \u201cquickly cut to the chase.\u201d Here\u2019s a good example of what we mean: Gallup asked a similar question about free speech in a 2016 survey for the Knight Foundation and Newseum Institute, but its question was more verbose and less pointed than Pew\u2019s. Advertisement \u201cIf you had to choose, do you think it is more important for colleges to [ROTATED: create a positive learning environment for all students by prohibiting certain speech or expression of viewpoints that are offensive or biased against certain groups of people, (or to) create an open learning environment where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints, even if it means allowing speech that is offensive or biased against certain groups of people]?\u201d Gallup asked. When the question was asked this way, 22 percent of college students supported the idea of \u201cprohibiting certain speech or expression of viewpoints that are offensive or biased against certain groups of people.\u201d That\u2019s a far cry from the 40 percent of millennials in the Pew poll who essentially said the same thing. But it\u2019s important to note that Pew asked about the government banning speech; Gallup asked whether colleges should. Advertisement Interestingly, the age gap in the Gallup poll was opposite the Pew survey, with students 12 points more supportive of a learning environment that allowed offensive or biased speech than U.S. adults overall (78 percent vs. 66 percent). Sasse spoke about \u201c40 percent of Americans under age 35,\u201d but note that the Pew poll was limited to adults under 35. Moreover, some pollsters have found that the idea of banning offensive speech appeals just as widely to the general population. \u201cMost Americans (59%) say people should be allowed to express unpopular opinions in public, even those that are deeply offensive to other people,\u201d a 2017 survey by the Cato Institute found. \u201cA substantial minority (40%), however, say government should prevent people from engaging in hate speech against certain groups in public.\u201d Advertisement Wegmann said \u201cno argument here that a whole lot of Americans outside the under-35 group also have a bad understanding of the First Amendment\u201d and added that Sasse has \u201coften said that we haven\u2019t done civics well in this country for decades.\u201d Sasse does have a point about young Americans and free speech \u2014 broadly speaking. Mark Bauerlein, an English professor at Emory University and the author of \u201cThe Dumbest Generation,\u201d said more than half of 12th-graders fail to get passing grades in U.S. history, according to the National Assessment of Education Progress, and in 2010, only 24 percent reached proficiency in civics. Less than half of college students (46 percent) recognized that the First Amendment protected hate speech, according to a 2017 poll commissioned by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and conducted by YouGov. More than one-third of students (35 percent) said hate speech should be protected by the First Amendment. Advertisement But this debate about the bounds of free speech also seems to be influenced by political ideology. Many colleges are seen as liberal havens, so Republicans may feel they have more at stake in this debate. Looked at another way, Democrats may feel they have more at stake since they tend to get the greatest share of the minority vote. In the polls we reviewed, the percentage of Democrats favoring bans on hate speech or statements that offend minority groups was larger than the percentage of Republicans or independents. The Pinocchio Test Sasse mangled the findings of a Pew poll, but his larger argument \u2014 that many American youths and college students are leery of free speech \u2014 seems to be on target. To what extent is difficult to say. The three polls of young Americans that we looked at (from Pew in 2015, Gallup in 2016 and YouGov in 2017) all worded their questions differently and found varying levels of support for the idea of censoring hate speech or statements that offend minorities. At the low end, Gallup found 22 percent support among college students. At the high end, Pew landed on 40 percent among 18- to 34-year-olds. Asked about the differences between Pew\u2019s narrow question and Sasse\u2019s liberal reinterpretation, a spokesman said the senator was trying to make his point quickly. But sort-of hitting the target doesn\u2019t work when describing polls, which are intricate by nature. No one asked the Pew poll respondents about the First Amendment. No one asked whether it was dangerous. And no one should buy Sasse\u2019s 40 percent statistic about the \u201cdangerous\u201d First Amendment, for which we award Two Pinocchios.

        "claim": "\"About 95 percent of (Ohio\u2019s) electricity comes from burning coal.\"",
        "doc": "President Barack Obama, declaring that \"Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction\" on climate change, announced sweeping measures on June 25 to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. He said he would use executive power to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation\u2019s power plants, as the centerpiece in a three-part plan that includes new federal funds to advance renewable energy technology, and spending to protect cities and states from the ravages of storms and droughts aggravated by a changing climate. Republicans led by House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio were quick to condemn the measures, saying they constituted government overreach that would constrict energy production and strangle the nation\u2019s economic recovery. \"The president\u2019s policies are not helping the economy, they\u2019re making it worse,\" Boehner said in a news conference. He said the policies would have the effect of \"increasing the cost of electricity \u2013 especially in a state like mine, in Ohio, where about 95 percent of our electricity comes from burning coal.\" That figure caught PolitiFact Ohio's attention. We asked Boehner's staff for a source to back it up. They did not have a source for the figure, but Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said: \"Regardless, it\u2019s clear the overwhelming majority of electricity in Ohio comes from the coal that the president is attacking.\" In support of that statement, he cited a Washington Post article that looked at the question of whether Obama was waging a \"war on coal.\" So how much of Ohio's electricity does come from coal? The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has a feature on its website that asks and answers the question. \"Coal, a nonrenewable fossil fuel, is used to generate 77.87 percent of the electricity in Ohio,\" the PUCO site says. PUCO says about 11 percent of Ohio electricity is generated by nuclear power, about 9.1 percent is produced using natural gas and other gases, and petroleum is burned to create steam to turn the turbine blades that generate about 1.0 percent of Ohio electricity. (PUCO lists as its source the Edison Electric Institute, EEI, the association of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies.) The U.S. Energy Information Administration rounds the figure to 78 percent for electricity generated by coal. That percentage is far higher than the 42 percent of electricity generated by coal nationally, according to the EIA. Our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker also examined Boehner's statement. In addition to citing the figures from PUCO, they noted that the latest figures show that Ohio cut its net generation of electricity from coal by about 10 percent from 2010 to 2011. Fact Checker also took note of Ohio law, cited by the PUCO and Energy Information Administration, that is designed to reduce reliance on coal by requiring that at least 25 percent of all electricity sold in the state come from alternative energy sources by 2025. Half of that must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric power, geothermal and biomass. Boehner's overall point was correct. As his spokesman said, the vast majority of Ohio's electricity does come from coal, and the percentage is far higher than the national average. But the state officially is looking to reduce, not maintain, its reliance on coal, and has made progress in the effort. And while the percentage of electricity from coal is high, Boehner's figure of 95 percent exaggerates it by 17 percentage points. That's a significant difference. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",

        "claim": "Charlie Crist \"raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again.\"",
        "doc": "Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill that will cut auto tag fees and pointed the finger at his predecessor for raising them in the first place. \"We are going to right the wrong of the 2009 tax increase that Charlie Crist enacted,\" Scott said as he signed the fee rollback on April 2. Scott, a Republican, is expected to face Democratic frontrunner Crist in November. The Republican Party of Florida joined the Crist-as-tax-hiker chorus on Twitter: \"[emailprotected] raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again.\" We\u2019ll examine what type of taxes were raised under Crist in 2009 and what he has said about raising taxes in the future. Crist signed tax and fee increases in 2009 In May 2009, then-Republican Gov. Crist signed a $66.5 billion budget that included a slew of new taxes and fees -- roughly $2 billion worth -- intended to balance the state budget during the recession. The hikes included auto tag fees, a $1-a-pack cigarette tax, as well as higher fees to visit state parks and to file civil lawsuits and foreclosure actions. There is no dispute that Crist signed those tax and fee increases into law, but the Republican Party of Florida omits that the tax and fee hikes were supported by the Republican-led Legislature at the time. That includes influential Republican legislators who now in key leadership positions: Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, who was House majority whip at the time; House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel; and Senate President Don Gaetz. Recently, Crist made no apologies for supporting the auto tag increase when he spoke during an event in Tampa on the same day that Scott signed the cut into law. \"We had to get through a tough time, and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions,\" Crist said in Tampa. \"And we saved thousands of teachers' jobs, law enforcement officers' jobs, firefighters' jobs.\" What Crist has said about the potential for future tax increases As for Crist\u2019s willingness to raise future taxes, the Republican Party of Florida pointed to a brief clip of MSNBC\u2019s Ed Schultz interviewing Crist on Nov. 18, 2013, a couple of weeks after Crist declared his candidacy. We went looking for the complete exchange about taxes; here\u2019s how it went: Schultz: \"What is your philosophy of taxation? What would you do different. We have income inequality as a huge issue in this country. The wealthy seem to get the breaks. They have under the conservative rule. What would you do differently? What would you do with Florida\u2019s finances and what would you expect? Would you expect more out of the wealthiest residents?\" Crist: \"Well, I think we all have to expect more out of each other. I don\u2019t like to raise taxes. I don\u2019t know that anybody really enjoys the idea of doing that. I did that as a governor, though.\" Schultz: \"Would you do it again?\" Crist: \"If necessary, I would. I mean, you know.\" Schultz: \"Is it necessary now?\" Crist: \"We have the highest budget we\u2019ve had in the history of Florida right now at $74 billion. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessary right now. I like to live within our means if we possibly can do so, but we have to properly fund public education. We have to properly fund the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. And when Governor Scott got elected, the very first session, he whacked public education funding by $1.3 billion.\" Schultz: \"Would you restore that?\" Crist: \"Absolutely, we\u2019d restore that.\" Schultz: \"So that money would come back in under Charlie Crist.\" Crist: \"Yes sir. It would. And the $300 million, he took out of higher ed the second session.\" Schultz: \"And how would you pay for it?\" Crist: \"Pay for it by the existing revenues that we have. And if necessary, if we have to raise taxes, I would do it, but I\u2019d rather not if we don\u2019t have to. Like I said, I like to live within our means.\" Crist\u2019s campaign website includes a mention of \"tax cuts for middle-class families\" on his policy position page about the economy and jobs, but it\u2019s vague. It states: \"Today, Florida\u2019s tax policy works only if you are a special interest with a lobbyist \u2013 but it fails everyday Floridians and small business owners. As Governor, Charlie will reform government to put the people first, using incentives to help homegrown Florida small businesses grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving handouts to political supporters.\" We sent the claim by the Republican Party to Crist\u2019s campaign and an informal adviser to the campaign, former state Sen. Steve Geller. Geller said Crist supports giving small businesses a tax break and pointed to part of Crist\u2019s announcement speech in November: \"As governor, we are going to have a tax policy that puts you the people first \u2013 and when we can cut taxes \u2013 and I do believe in cutting taxes \u2013 it is you the people who would get the relief \u2013 and when we spend money to help business, we are using it to grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving it away to supporters.\" Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said that Crist \"raised taxes in 2009 and won\u2019t rule out raising taxes again.\" Crist -- along with the Republican-led Legislature -- did raise the cigarette tax and a slew of fees including auto tag fees in 2009 to balance the budget during a recession. When asked in November if he would raise taxes in the future, Crist said \"if necessary.\" The Republicans omitted Crist\u2019s softer language in the same interview when he added, \"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessary right now.\" We rate this claim Mostly True.",

Let\u2019s fact-check this video through this article. Claim: Home Minister Amith Shah said, \u2018Modi Ji sleeps for 24 hours for the welfare of the poor of the country.\u2019 Fact: This is a clipped video of a 2021 speech of Amit Shah at a public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal. In the original speech, Shah states that PM Modi thinks 24 hours a day for the welfare of the country\u2019s poor, while Mamata Banerjee thinks 24 hours a day about her Nephew becoming the Chief Minister. Amit Shah saying \u2018Sochte\u2019 is being shared as him saying \u2018Sothe\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. We searched the internet with relevant keywords and found that similar posts also went viral in 2021; the earliest one was from April 2021. Since the video in the viral post looks like Amit Shah\u2019s speech at some meeting, we searched on the BJP\u2019s official YouTube channel for his speeches from April 2021 and found the video in which he made these remarks, as seen in the viral video. The video was uploaded on 17th April 2021 and was titled \u2018HM Shri Amit Shah addresses public meeting in Chapra, West Bengal.\u2019 At 5:39, Sec. Amit Shah says, \u2018Modi Ji 24 ghanta sochte hain ki des ke gareebon ka Kalyan ho.\u2019 This translates to \u2018Modi Ji thinks 24 hours for the welfare of the country\u2019s poor\u2018. He then continues to say, \u2018aur Didi 24 ghanta sothi hai, mera bhatija (Nephew) kab mukhyamantri bane\u2026\u2019, which translates to \u2018Didi (Mamata Banerjee) thinks 24 hours a day about his Nephew becoming the CM\u2019 Amit Shah saying \u2018Sochte\u2019 is being shared as him saying \u2018Sothe\u2019. The viral post only contains the part of Amit Shah\u2019s speech while he speaks about Modi and cleverly cuts off the portion in which he speaks about Mamata Banerjee to make it look like he did say that Modi \u2018sleeps\u2019 24hrs a day instead of \u2018thinks\u2019. To sum up, an old video of Amit Shah\u2019s speech is shared as him saying PM Modi sleeps 24 hours a day for the welfare of the poor.",

        "claim": "Says American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"an 80 percent approval rating.\"",
        "doc": "Russian President Vladimir Putin recently called Donald Trump \"brilliant\" and \"talented,\" and Trump wears those compliments as a badge of honor. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Dec. 20, host Chuck Todd asked the real estate mogul and Republican presidential front runner why he is so comfortable praising Putin, noting that Trump has called Putin a \"strong leader.\" \"He is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he\u2019s a weak leader?\" Trump responded. \"He\u2019s making mincemeat out of our president.\" Then Trump turned to his reliable measure of a person\u2019s success: the polls. \"He\u2019s got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country. Okay?\" Trump said. \"So it\u2019s not even done by his pollsters. He\u2019s very popular within Russia; that may change.\" An 80 percent approval rating is pretty darn high. For comparison, President Barack Obama\u2019s job approval rating iscurrently about 46 percent andpeaked at 64 percent in February 2009, his second month in office, according to Pew Research Center. So we wondered if Trump is correct that American polling shows Putin has such a high rating among the Russian people. In a first for Trump on the Truth-O-Meter thus far, he is. By the numbers A November study written by four American researchers backs up Trump\u2019s point, finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin. \"What Trump said is consistent with what we found,\" said Scott Gehlbach, a co-author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Given that Putin achieved strikingly high public approval ratings, the study asked whether Putin\u2019s popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters. A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of \"social desirability bias,\" the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms. To correct for this, the researchers used a list experiment, a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin. Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support, but not which ones. By comparing the difference between a control group, which was presented with a list that did not include Putin, with a group that received a list that did include Putin, the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president. After conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year, Gehlbach and his co-authors concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real. If anything, their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate. Gehlbach noted, though, that the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting. Further, it\u2019s likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media. \"It\u2019s reasonable that some people support Putin because of what they see on the evening news,\" Gehlbach said. This study is evidence that Putin is genuinely popular in Russia, wrote Joshua Tucker, a political science professor at New York University, in a Nov. 24 post on the Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog. In sum, \"the findings suggest both that the West will likely be dealing with a popular leader when it interacts with Putin in the days to come,\" Tucker wrote. One potential wrinkle in Trump\u2019s claim is that while the American researchers designed the study, a Russian polling company, the Levada Center, actually conducted the survey. But Gehlbach said that doesn\u2019t dilute Trump\u2019s claim because the Levada Center is well-regarded as independent from the Russian government. Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion expert and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, also said the Levada Center is held in high regard and its findings are consistent with related research by the U.S.-based PewResearch Center. This past summer, Pew found 88 percent of Russians \"have confidence in (Putin), to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\" Putin\u2019s standing is substantially lower among Americans, with just 21 percent saying they have confidence in him. Gehlbach\u2019s article, which will be published in the journal Post-Soviet Affairs, also mentions how Putin\u2019s high approval ratings are often confirmed by Western researchers\u2019 polls. The study citesan Associated Press-NORC at the University of Chicago poll that found Putin\u2019s approval rating to be about 81 percent in 2014. Our ruling Trump said American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"an 80 percent approval rating.\" Multiple American polls have found Putin\u2019s approval rating to hover around 80 percent among the Russian public, including a recent study that aimed to adjust for any possibility that respondents have been lying to pollsters out of fear or social expectations.

But this estimate was from a year ago, and it is unclear how many employees the Internal Revenue Service will be able to hire, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax issues, told USA TODAY.\"The difference between now and a year ago salaries have gone up,\" Gleckman said. \"So presumably they couldn't hire as many people as they thought they could because they have to pay them more. ... Again, we don't have an exact business plan for the IRS.\"The IRS will determine its final hiring plans for the next decade in the upcoming months, as Verify and the Associated Press reported. Experts also said the employees who will be hired won't all be special agents either, as the post implies with the word \"soldiers.\"Fact check: False claim Rudy Giuliani replaced Merrick Garland as attorney generalSpecial agents are the only IRS personnel authorized to carry guns and conduct criminal investigations, Justin Cole, a spokesperson for the IRS Criminal Investigations unit, told USA TODAY in an email. The IRS currently has about 80,000 employees, of which 2,100 are special agents.Most of the new hires, however, will be comprised of positions such as IT support staff, people to answer the helpline phones and staff to assist taxpayers, Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan federal budget watchdog organization, told USA TODAY in an email. Most of these employees will not carry guns or see taxpayers in person, Gleckman said.Fact check: House Speaker Pelosi doesn't have authority on her own to remove president from officeEllis also said the new employees would in many cases replace staff who left via retirement and other attrition.The Associated Press reported that the IRS has lost 50,000 employees in the past five years due to attrition. Natasha Sarin, the Treasury Department\u2019s counselor for tax policy and implementation, told the AP that \"more than half of IRS employees who work in enforcement are currently eligible for retirement.\"These hires also come in the wake of a decade of budget cuts that left the IRS unable to lay off or replace talent, and the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to these cuts, according to Gleckman.Contrary to the post's claim, there is no individual income tax increase for anybody under H.R. 5376, according to Gleckman. A Treasury Department official also confirmed to USA TODAY that the legislation does not raise individual tax rates.\"The tax increases included in the bill apply to corporations \u2013 not individuals,\" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY.USA TODAY previously reported that there are two taxes on corporations under the act: a 15% minimum tax on corporations that make over $1 billion in revenue and a 1% excise tax on corporate share buybacks.Fact check: No, Barack Obama has not promised to vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 electionWhile the corporations subject to these taxes write the checks to the revenue agency, \"ultimately the cost falls on some combination of shareholders and workers, both of which are all over the income scale, even below $30,000,\" William McBride, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, told USA TODAY in an email.Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that the IRS is hiring 87,000 \"soldiers\" to prosecute citizens and raising taxes on those who make $30,000 or more. The 87,000 figure was an estimate from a 2021 report by the Treasury Department; the IRS hasn't yet finalized a plan. A majority of the hires will not be special agents and thus will not be carrying weapons. The legislation does not raise individual tax rates for anyone, according to a Treasury Department spokesperson.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

        "doc": "As the Wisconsin National Guard was activated Nov. 12 in preparation for a verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, a viral meme questioned why that didn\u2019t happen last year. The meme, shared on Facebook, says, \"500 National Guardsmen being called to Kenosha ahead of the Rittenhouse verdict. Had they done this in the first place, there wouldn\u2019t have been a trial.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim implies that the National Guard was not in Kenosha in August 2020 when Rittenhouse, then 17, shot three people, two of them fatally. But Gov. Tony Evers called in the National Guard on Aug. 24, and the guardsmen arrived the same day. The Rittenhouse shooting happened the following day, Aug. 25. The events that unfolded in Kenosha that summer began on Aug. 23, when Jacob Blake was shot in the back by a police officer who was trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. Blake was left paralyzed. He had been armed with a knife during the encounter, and the officer was not charged with a crime. A bystander\u2019s video of the shooting circulated widely and reignited protests that had blanketed the U.S. earlier in the year, after police brutality against other Black people such as George Floyd. Protesters poured into Kenosha, the New York Times reported. The day after the Blake shooting, protests grew violent, with more than 30 fires set and dozens of buildings destroyed. Evers activated the National Guard and 125 members arrived in Kenosha on the night of Aug. 24. On Aug. 25, Rittenhouse was invited by a friend to go to Kenosha to protect a car dealership during the protests. He has testified that he went to provide first aid. He was armed with an AR-15. That evening, just before midnight, Rittenhouse shot three people, killing two and wounding the third. He is charged with intentional homicide, reckless homicide and other crimes, and he has pleaded self-defense. A Facebook post says, \"500 National Guardsmen being called to Kenosha ahead of the Rittenhouse verdict. Had they done this in the first place, there wouldn\u2019t have been a trial.\" The claim implies that the National Guard was not present in Kenosha when Rittenhouse shot three people, two of them fatally. The National Guard was activated and arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 24, 2020. The Rittenhouse shooting happened the following day, Aug. 25, 2020. We rate this claim False.

        "doc": "The footage was shared here on Facebook on August 19, 2022, where it has garnered more than 18,000 views. The clip, which is more than 11 minutes long, shows a ship slowly tilting before sinking. Several tugboats and other vessels can also be seen in the video. \"A Bangladeshi ship carrying fuel worth six billion taka [$63 million] has sunk,\" reads the Bengali-language caption. \"The hull cracked after it was loaded.\" Facebook users' comments on the post suggested many believed the accident happened. \"They should have checked the ship before loading,\" one commented. \"It was a curse on Bangladesh,\" another said. Below are screenshots of comments from Facebook users The footage has been viewed more than 10,000 times after appearing alongside similar claims on Facebook here and here. However, the claim is false. A combination of keyword and reverse image search on Google found the footage was published here on November 17, 2015 on a YouTube channel by Arkananta Indonesia, an Indonesian marine construction company. The Indonesian title and caption of the video identify the vessel as the Wihan Sejahtera. It also says the vessel sunk in waters off the Lamong Bay port terminal, in East Java province. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (left) and the genuine footage from 2015 (right): People speaking Indonesian language can be heard off-camera in the video, talking about the vessel. \"Look at that, many passengers are jumping off the ship,\" one man says at the start of the clip. At the one-minute, 30-second mark, another says: \"Don't worry, the ship won't sink. It would be tilting just like that.\" Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee released an investigative report on the sinking in 2016, saying 212 people were rescued from the passenger ship following the accident. \"There were no casualties from this accident,\" the report said. It included a picture of the Wihan Sejahtera, which has the same livery as the ship seen in the misleading video. International media reported about the accident here and here, saying the vessel was carrying more than 100 people when it sank on November 16, 2015. Indonesian media outlets RCTI and Berita Satu broadcast similar footage in 2015 about the accident. As of August 31, 2022, AFP has found no official reports of ships sinking in Bangladesh during the month.",

        "claim": "Lists eight wealthy politicians and public figures who \u201cgot millions (or close to it) in PPP loans.\u201d",
        "doc": "A popular Facebook post claims that some wealthy Republicans and other public figures have benefited from the federal government\u2019s $2 trillion coronavirus relief package. The post, which was published July 7 by a page called Feminist News, includes a collage of photos depicting eight public figures. It claims that businesses ranging from Kanye West\u2019s apparel company, Yeezy, to \"Devin Nunes\u2019 winery\" have received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program. \"All these millionaires got millions (or close to it) in PPP loans while tens of millions of Americans got a bullsh*t $1200 check months ago,\" reads text in the collage. \"This is how a mafia state works. The small inner circle gets rewarded. Everyone else suffers.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 50,000 times, and other popular liberal pages have published similar posts. (Screenshot from Facebook) The Paycheck Protection Program is a federal loan initiative to encourage businesses to keep workers on their payrolls during the coronavirus pandemic. The loans are forgivable, meaning some recipients may be able to keep the money. It passed as part of a larger legislative package in late March and was extended by President Donald Trump on July 4. Two days later, the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department released a dataset with details about the millions of loans awarded to businesses and nonprofits so far. We used that data to take a closer look at the Facebook post. The post is correct in saying that some businesses connected to prominent Republicans have received money as part of the program. But in some cases the post oversimplifies their connection to those businesses, and the data do not show that each person personally received \"millions (or close to it).\" Some of the Republicans mentioned in the Facebook post directly benefited from PPP loans. Others own stakes in PPP beneficiary companies or have more indirect relationships. The loan database released by the SBA and the Treasury Department does not specify exactly how much money each entity received. Instead, it offers wide ranges. We took a look at the database, as well as news reports, to see how each person mentioned in the Facebook post is connected to PPP beneficiaries. (Search the database for yourself here.) What the post says: \"Kanye West\u2019s company, Yeezy\" Who got the money: Yeezy LLC Prior to a July 8 interview in which he said he is no longer supporting the president, West was one of Trump\u2019s biggest celebrity supporters. According to the PPP loan database, Yeezy received between $2 million and $5 million. What the post says: \"Jared Kushner\u2019s family\" Who got the money: Several companies wholly or partially owned by the Kushners Several companies connected to the family of the president\u2019s son-in-law benefited from the PPP, according to reports from ProPublica and the Daily Beast. Observer Holdings LLC, the parent company of Observer Media \u2014 which Kushner used to run and is currently owned by his brother-in-law\u2019s investment firm \u2014 received between $350,000 and $1 million. A company called Princeton Forrestal LLC \u2014 40%-owned by Kushner relatives, according to a 2018 securities filing analyzed by the Daily Beast \u2014 received between $1 million and $2 million. Esplanade Livingston LLC, a company connected to the Kushners, received between $350,000 and $1 million. The Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy in Livingston, N.J., received between $1 million and $2 million. It was named after Kushner\u2019s grandfather and is supported by the family. Hollwich Kushner Architecture, a firm headed by Marc Kushner, Jared Kushner\u2019s first cousin, received between $150,000 and $350,000. What the posts: \"Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao\" Who got the money: The Foremost Group LLC Chao is the U.S. transportation secretary. A shipping business run by her family benefited from the PPP. The Foremost Group received between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the loan database. Contrary to what the Facebook post says, Chao herself did not receive a loan. The Foremost Group is not listed on Chao\u2019s 2017 financial disclosure, but her relationship with the company has been the subject of a House of Representatives ethics investigation. The Facebook post notes she is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. What the post says: \"Trump\u2019s campaign manager\u2019s company\" Who got the money: CloudCommerce Inc. CloudCommerce, a digital marketing company whose largest shareholder is Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, received between $350,000 and $1 million from the PPP, according to CBS News and the loan database. Between 2017 and 2018, CloudCommerce acquired several of Parscale\u2019s companies, and he joined the company\u2019s board of directors. On Dec. 10, 2019, Parscale resigned from the board, but he retained his 34.9% stake in CloudCommerce, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. As of that date, Parscale was not a \"director, officer, employee or contractor\" of the company, according to the filing. The current chairman and CEO of CloudCommerce is Andrew Van Noy. Van Noy told CBS that Parscale \"no longer has any involvement in decision-making for the company, including the PPP loan.\" Neither Parscale Properties LLC, an investment company that Parscale set up with his family, nor Parscale Strategy LLC, a company that was set up by Parscale and has billed millions to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, has received money from the program. What the post says: \"Trump\u2019s super PAC\" Who got the money: Companies that have donated to a pro-Trump super PAC A pro-Trump super PAC did not receive money from the PPP. Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns Bang Energy, was lent between $5 million and $10 million. In 2019, Vital Pharmaceuticals gave $250,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC that spent $36 million during the 2018 campaign cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Another firm that has donated to the super PAC, G.H. Palmer Associates, received between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the loan database and CNBC. Companies connected to other major Trump donors were among the earliest recipients of PPP loans, the Associated Press reported. What the post says: Betsy DeVos Who got the money: Renaissance Acquisition Co. LLC The education secretary herself did not receive a loan, but the Facebook post framed it that way. Bloomberg reported that a company with the same name as one listed on her 2017 financial disclosure report did. Renaissance Acquisition Co., which operates an Indianapolis-based company that provides services to nonprofits, received between $2 million and $5 million, according to the loan database. In her financial disclosure, DeVos reported earning $216,600 as a distributive share from Renaissance Acquisition, meaning she is a partial owner or partner in the business. What the post says: \"Devin Nunes\u2019 winery\" Who got the money: Phase 2 Cellars LLC and Alpha Omega Winery LLC Rep. Nunes, R-Calif., is not the sole owner of Phase 2 Cellars, a vineyard in San Luis Obispo that received between $1 million and $2 million from the PPP. But he is a partial owner, holding between $50,001 and $100,000 in equity in it, according to a Daily Beast analysis of Nunes\u2019 most recent financial disclosure. Alpha Omega Winery, another California vineyard in which Nunes holds equity, received a loan within the same range. What the post says: \"Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas\" Who got the money: JRW Corp. JRW Corp., a Fort Worth, Texas, car dealership where Williams serves as the sole director and president, was lent between $1 million and $2 million. His own stake in the company exceeds $50 million, according to Williams\u2019 most recent financial disclosure. We reached out to Feminist News for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back. A Facebook post says eight wealthy public figures received loans as part of the federal Paycheck Protection Program. The post correctly characterizes how West, Kushner and Williams are connected to companies that received money. However, it oversimplifies how Chao, Parscale, DeVos and Nunes benefited from the program. The federal government lent millions of dollars to companies connected to, but not wholly owned by, Parscale, Nunes and DeVos. A shipping company owned by Chao\u2019s family received between $350,000 and $1 million, but she did not receive a loan herself, and the company is not listed on her financial disclosure. The Facebook post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "Looking for a gap between an object and its reflection is a way to distinguish two-way mirrors from ordinary mirrors.",
        "doc": "With the recent advancements in miniaturized electronics, it\u2019s hard for any of us to know we\u2019re not being spied upon these days; cameras and transmitters can now be made so small and unobtrusive that most of us wouldn\u2019t be able to find them even if we knew where to look for them. Many would-be peeping toms still resort to less technologically-advanced methods such as peepholes and two-way mirrors, though, hence a warning which began circulating on the Internet in April 1999: HOW TO DETECT A 2-WAY MIRROR When we visit toilets, bathrooms, hotel rooms, changing rooms, etc. How many of you know for sure that the seemingly ordinary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror, or actually a 2-way mirror (i.e. they can see you, but you can\u2019t see them)? There have been many cases of people installing 2-way mirrors in female changing rooms. It is very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. It\u2019s time to get paranoid. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty? Well, once again, I am here to enlighten you. Just conduct this simple test: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, for it is a 2-way mirror! You can further ascertain the nature of the suspect surface by hurling an object (e.g. a chair!!!) at it. The chair will go through. So remember, every time you see a mirror, do the \u201cfingernail test\u201d. It doesn\u2019t cost you anything. It is simple to do, and it might save you from getting \u201cvisually raped\u201d! Share this with your girlfriends. First off, we should clear up some confusing terminology. The subject this message addresses are panels which look like mirrors on one side but work like tinted windows from the other side \u2014 that is, if you\u2019re on one side of such a panel, it appears to be mirror in which you can see your reflection; if you\u2019re on the other side, it serves as a window through which you can see everything (and everyone) on the other side. These panels are confusingly referred to as both \u201cone-way mirrors\u201d and \u201ctwo-ways mirrors,\u201d so to avoid additional confusion we will henceforth call them \u201ctransparent mirrors.\u201d The fingernail test described above is a method for determining the difference between first-surface mirrors and second-surface mirrors, both of which are ordinary mirrors glazed in a different fashion. With a first-surface mirror, any object you put up against it will touch its reflection because the reflective part of mirror is laid in right at the surface. With a second-surface mirror, a gap between the object and its reflection will be visible because a layer of clear glass has been incorporated over the reflective part of the mirror to better protect it. First-surface looking glasses are quite expensive and are generally used only for specialized applications such as fine optical instruments or lasers, in which a protective layer of glass would interfere with the path of light or diminish precision. As such, you\u2019re unlikely to ever encounter one being used as an ordinary mirror in a home or a dressing room; for those applications much cheaper second-surface mirrors are nearly always used. Therefore, if you discover what appears to be a first-surface mirror (i.e., an object you place up against it touches its reflection) in a dressing room, the chances are good it\u2019s a transparent mirror. However, the fingernail test isn\u2019t necessarily a very good one, as judging whether an object placed up against such a mirror is touching its reflection can be affected by factors such as the size of the mirror, the angle of the mirror, the amount of lighting present, and the type of object used to conduct the test, and an unpracticed observer might easily mistake an ordinary mirror for a transparent one this way. (Ascertaining \u201cthe nature of the suspect surface by hurling an object at it\u201d could also be quite embarrassing and costly should it prove to be an ordinary mirror.) There are better tests based on some of the more obvious physical features of transparent mirrors. What we call transparent mirrors are laminated coated glass products which have been treated with Mirropane on the first surface of the glass. They\u2019re also known as \u201cobservation mirrors\u201d and are commonly used in settings (such as police stations, schools, and businesses) where there is a need to conduct unobtrusive monitoring for safety and security purposes. (Think of the interrogation room as shown in the police station of the television drama Law & Order: suspects inside the room see a panel which looks like a mirror, but from the hallway outside the panel functions as a window through which detectives can monitor the proceedings unobserved.) Transparent mirrors are most obviously distinguishable from ordinary mirrors in that they\u2019re not hung on walls as ordinary mirrors are, but they\u2019re set into walls (or doors) as windows are. In other words, if there\u2019s a wall behind a mirror, the mirror is almost certainly an ordinary one; a transparent mirror would be part of the wall itself. Also, the lighting in front of a transparent mirror must be much brighter than the lighting on the other side (where the hidden observers are) for it to work effectively, and some light leaks through from the brighter side to the dimmer side. According to the folks in Mirropane\u2019s technical support group, you can use these factors to your advantage by pressing your eyes up against the mirror and cupping your hands around them (to block out the light from the room you\u2019re in): if you\u2019re truly dealing with a transparent mirror, you should be able to see at least a little something of the open area behind it. Also, rapping on the mirror should provide an aural clue: ordinary mirrors have backings and are usually placed against walls, so rapping on them will generally produce dull thuds; transparent mirrors are set into walls with open areas behind them, so rapping on them should produce much more open, hollow sounds. These methods of detection are more reliable than the fingernail test and should be preferred to taking a chance on getting arrested for property damage after tossing a chair through a perfectly normal mirror misjudged via less accurate means.",

        "claim": "\"There are almost 60,000 North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them.\"",
        "doc": "As North Carolina\u2019s new lawmakers settle in to the General Assembly, debate over one of the state\u2019s biggest issues \u2014 school choice\u2006\u2014 is heating back up. The Civitas Institute, a Raleigh-based conservative group, is pushing for expanded school choice, writing in a Jan. 28 tweet that \"there are almost 60,000 North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them.\" The high number is \"because of the caps currently on #schoolchoice programs,\" the group said in a second tweet the next day. A corresponding blog post called the situation a \"crisis\" and said the waitlist total was larger than the number of students in all but three of the state\u2019s school districts. This made us scratch our heads. Are there really that many students stuck on waitlists? Brooke Medina, communications director for the Civitas Institute, said her group estimated the number of students waiting to get into schools of choice \u2006\u2014 which include private schools and charter schools\u2006\u2014 to be approximately 56,631. She said that number came from two sources: The students on waitlists for scholarships or state funds to help them afford private schools, and the students on waitlists to enroll in public charter schools. In the first category, Medina said Civitas Institute looked at the Opportunity Scholarship Program, the Disabilities Grant Program and the Education Savings Account. According to the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, 7,593 of 8,113 eligible applicants got Opportunity Scholarships \u2014 which provide up to $4,200 per year and are commonly known as school vouchers \u2014 in 2018-19. Medina said Civitas Institute counted the 520 eligible applicants who did not get scholarships as being on a waitlist. But Kathryn Marker, director of grants, training and outreach for the NCSEAA, said these students were not actually placed on a physical waitlist. They were simply not awarded the money because the number of eligiblekindergarten and first-grade students receiving scholarships had already reached the program's assigned cap. It would have been more accurate to say the students were \"unable to be awarded the scholarship because of the cap,\" she said. The same is true for the Disabilities Grant Program, which covers tuition, fees and some other expenses for students with disabilities. Only 833 of 1,164 eligible students received this grant, leaving 331 students out, according to the NCSEAA. The Education Savings Account, a program that awards state funds to parents of students with disabilities, gave out 347 grants, according to the NCSEAA. But the data did not say how many of the 1,430 total applicants were eligible. Medina said Civitas Institute assumed that a similar proportion of applicants would have been eligible for both the Education Savings Account and the Disabilities Grant Program, so the group estimated that approximately 780 students would have been rejected. Together, these three numbers total 1,631 students. The rest of the nearly 60,000 students on waitlists are those hoping to enroll in publicly-funded charter schools, Medina said. Charter schools operate outside school districts under the direction of independent governing boards. They were adopted into state law in 1996, and now 185 of them serve more than 100,000 students throughout North Carolina. According to a 2018 report from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, there were 55,165 students on charter school waitlists as of December 2017. But this figure comes with some caveats, which the report spells out. \"This figure reflects a point in time \u2014 waitlists could change daily \u2014 and cannot be verified as an unduplicated count of students \u2014 as a student could be on multiple school waitlists,\" the report said, adding that it was based on the \"best information available.\" Medina acknowledged that duplicates could have skewed her group\u2019s estimate, but suggested that the 55,165 figure could actually be an underestimate because only 134 of the 185 charter schools (173 at the time of the report) provided waitlist data. To be safe, however, she said her group rounded the number down to 55,000 students. \"We've presented this aggregate as an estimate,\" Medina said. \"Despite this, we believe it is a reasonable one.\" So to recap, Civitas Institute counted about 55,000 students on charter school waitlists, plus another 1,631 students who missed out on scholarship money for private schools. That makes a total of 56,631students, which is close enough to support the claim that \"almost 60,000\" students were on waitlists. But with so many caveats at play, the group should have been clearer that its number was an estimate. Civitas Institute said \"there are almost 60,000 North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them.\" This number seems reasonable, but there are some caveats that should have prompted the group to note in its tweet that its figure was an estimate. We rate this statement Mostly True. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectlysaid eligible students did not receive Opportunity Scholarships due to a cap onprogram funding. Butthenumber ofscholarships was actuallylimited by a separate capthat says no more than 40 percent of the program'sfunds can be used toward kindergarten and first-grade students. Our ruling remains the same. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.

        "claim": "A video shows Paul George's jersey number changing from 13 to 14 after he performed a 360 dunk.",
        "doc": "Basketball pro Paul George\u2019s athletic talents were on display during the 2019 NBA All-Star game, when the Oklahoma City Thunder star threw down a 360 slam. While most hoops fans marveled at George\u2019s dunking abilities, others noticed something a bit strange \u2014 the number on his jersey appeared to change from 13 to 14 in mid-slam: This is honestly scary, PG\u2019s jersey changes from No. 13 to No. 14 after this dunk. pic.twitter.com/ZmXUUz5NCP \u2014 Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) February 21, 2019 The online audience offered up a number of theories as to what this video captured. Some claimed (perhaps facetiously) that in addition to mastering the art of the dunk, Paul George was also a master of the dark arts. While we can\u2019t say whether or not the NBA star has an interest in sleight of hand tricks, we can say that this video does not document any sort of voodoo, wizardry, or witchcraft. Another theory suggested that Paul George was wearing one of the NBA\u2019s new \u201csmart jerseys.\u201d After all, during the 2019 All-Star weekend NBA commissioner Adam Silver did unveil such jerseys, which can alter the names and numbers they display on their backs with a few clicks of an app: Adam Silver unveils the NBA jersey of the future. pic.twitter.com/h5GePOwOjx \u2014 NBA (@NBA) February 15, 2019 While this was certainly a more plausible theory than black magic, Paul George wasn\u2019t wearing one of these \u201csmart jerseys\u201d either. For one thing, these \u201csmart jerseys\u201d are still in development and not currently available for purchase or use in official games. Second, the number change showcased by Silver was much slower than the number change that supposedly took place during George\u2019s in-game dunk. Furthermore, the NBA would have certainly been promoting these new \u201csmart jerseys\u201d more if George were truly wearing one during the game. So was this footage digitally edited? This seemed to be the most likely explanation, but we examined the official footage posted to the NBA\u2019s YouTube channel and see any sign the video had been doctored. Rather, the official copy of this video seemed to show that the \u201cmagical\u201d number change was merely an effect involving a uniform wrinkle and lighting conditions. Slowing down the footage makes it apparent that George\u2019s jersey folded a bit, causing the \u201c3\u201d to briefly appear similar to a \u201c4.\u201d The top of the \u201c3\u201d was still visible throughout, however, showing that the number on his jersey never actually changed. We\u2019ve compiled a few stills of this innocuous moment below (click to enlarge). Notice how the top of the 3 is partly visible in all of these images: The \u201cnumber change\u201d can be seen around the 3:45 mark of the following video. It should be noted that a few seconds after this dunk, when George was on the other side of the floor, the number \u201c13\u201d was still clearly visible on his jersey: ",

Long lines snaking through Costco parking lots and Target shelves emptied of toilet paper are reminders of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In November 2020, as COVID-19 case numbers climbed to higher counts than ever, some store shelves began to look a lot like they did in March 2020. The Associated Press reported that \u201ca surge of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. is sending people back to stores to stockpile again.\u201d Walmart, Kroger, and Publix all reported experiencing a spike in demand, and some stores are placing per-shopper limits on toilet paper and other products. However, Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, formerly the Grocery Manufacturers Association, believed this time will be different. [Freeman] doesn\u2019t expect things to be as bad this go-around since lockdowns are being handled on a regional basis and everyone is better prepared. \u201cA more informed consumer combined with a more informed manufacturer and a more informed retailer should provide all of us with a greater sense of ease and ensure we can meet this growing demand,\u201d Freeman said. The biggest supply issue seems to be paper products: 21% of shelves that stock paper towels and toilet paper are empty, the highest level in at least a month, according to market research company IRI. Cleaning supplies have remained level at 16%. Before the pandemic, 5% to 7% of consumer goods were typically out of stock, IRI said. While some stores may be out of sought-after items, some shoppers have discovered that Amazon Fresh, a grocery delivery service from Amazon, seems to have kept at least one of the most coveted items in stock throughout 2020: Clorox and Lysol disinfecting wipes. It is not yet known if the rise in coronavirus cases in late 2020 will cause inventory shortfalls as severe as those seen in mid-March for paper products, cleaning supplies, and other items. However, as of mid-November, the Consumer Brands Association doesn\u2019t expect end-of-the-year levels to fall as low as they did in the spring.",

        "doc": "Videos and photos from different angles show Ardern receiving her booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the T\u0101maki Vaccination Clinic in Auckland. Multiple posts on Facebook and other social media platforms claim that New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern only pretended to get her COVID-19 vaccine booster shot on January 17, 2022. These posts refer to a 43-second video clip. The caption claims the injection area and the bandaid area are not the same and that it was just a PR opportunity with no evidence that it was the booster shot. However, these claims are false. The video referred to in the Facebook post is from the 1 News report published on the same date. The video and photos accompanying this claim are not in high resolution or taken from an angle that does not show the syringe pricking Ardern's arm. The NZ Herald news video clearly shows the syringe needle pulling on Ardern's skin when it is retracted after the booster jab. The nurse administering the vaccine places the bandaid at the exact spot too. High-quality photos of the event are also available on the stock images website Getty Images. According to the photo description, Ardern received a Pfizer-BioNTech booster vaccination. Ardern received her third dose at the T\u0101maki Vaccination Clinic in Auckland, New Zealand, on January 17, according to Stuff, a New Zealand media website. She spoke of booster and pediatric does of the COVID-19 vaccine becoming available for more New Zealanders and stressed the urgency of vaccination as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads worldwide. According to Reuters, she received her first dose of the vaccine on June 18, 2021. It is not the first time a politician or a celebrity has been falsely accused of faking a vaccination. Previously, Logically debunked a similar claim about Western Australia premier Mark McGowan's booster jab, which was also a case of videos and photos taken from different angles. Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and singer Mariah Carey came under the spotlight for similar reasons. A syringe with a retractable needle was used to inject Carey, which resulted in the needle not being visible clearly in the corresponding photos and videos.

        "claim": "\"80% of children born in developing countries die of cancer each year.\"",
        "doc": "In a tweet promoting legislation that he says will improve children\u2019s access to cancer treatments worldwide, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul shared a startling statistic about the likelihood of surviving cancer for children born in developing nations. \"A child\u2019s chance of surviving cancer should not be determined by where they are born,\" said McCaul, a Republican from Austin. \"But sadly, this is the case. 80% of children born in developing countries die of cancer each year. That is why I introduced the #GlobalHopeAct so children have access to life saving treatments.\" A reader flagged McCaul\u2019s statement about children dying of cancer and asked us to fact-check the statistic \u2014 which is inaccurate. We found that his claim is a misquote of a finding by the World Health Organization that just 20% of children with cancer in developing countries are cured. McCaul\u2019s spokeswoman Rachel Walker pointed to the World Health Organization\u2019s fact-sheet on childhood cancer as the source for the congressman\u2019s statement. \"In high-income countries more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many low- and middle-income countries only about 20% are cured,\" reads the fact-sheet, published in September of 2018. If 20% of children with cancer are cured, it is safe to assume that 80% are not, which would explain the figure McCaul cited in his claim. But he applied the number to an entirely different pool of people \u2014 every child born in developing countries \u2014 and created a new, inaccurate statistic. The World Health Organization finding measured survival rates for children diagnosed with cancer in different countries. It did not measure what percentage of all children born in different countries die from cancer each year. When reached via email, Walker acknowledged that \"a few words were left out in the tweet,\" but the larger claim McCaul made still stands: \"Too many kids die from curable cancers and we are working to change that with our bill.\" She also pointed to the video accompanying his tweet and noted that McCaul communicated the statistic differently. \"The mortality rate for children diagnosed with cancer in developing nations is a staggering 80%, matching the survival rate here in the United States,\" McCaul said in the video. We decided to pursue a fact-check of the language in McCaul\u2019s tweet, since it was flagged by a reader and is more readily accessible than the language he used in the video. Plus, it is still visible online and has not been corrected. But we kept the entire context of this statement in mind when issuing our ruling. Other studies on childhood cancer A paper published in the Ethiopian Journal of Health Science in 2016 found that \"cancer is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality across the world but more in developing countries.\" But there are barriers to measuring childhood cancers in developing countries. Nearly half of childhood cancer cases around the world are undiagnosed, according to a 2019 analysis published in The Lancet Oncology. The analysis found a clear disparity in where undiagnosed cases appeared worldwide. In western Europe and North America, 4% of cases go undiagnosed, while 49% in South Asia and 57% in West Africa are undiagnosed. But the figures that do exist show that mortality rates for childhood cancer are highest in developing countries. A 2019 study on pediatric cancer published in Science Magazine found that the survival rate for children in lower-middle-income countries is 30%, while the survival rate in high-income countries for children with cancer is 80%. Plus, most cancer cases are present in developing countries to start with: Nearly 90% of children with cancer live in low-income and middle-income countries, according to a different 2019 article in The Lancet Oncology. \"Childhood cancer mortality rates were higher 50 years ago, but can now fortunately be successfully treated in approximately 80% of cases where there is access to modern treatments and robust, supportive care,\" the article reads. \"However, only 10% of the world's children live in high-income countries where effective care is broadly accessible.\" Still, researchers behind the article said better data on lower income countries is needed \"to improve outcomes for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer worldwide.\" Our Ruling McCaul said in a tweet: \"80% of children born in developing countries die of cancer each year.\" This statement is a misquote of a World Health Organization finding that just 20% of children with cancer in developing countries are cured. McCaul\u2019s statistic was more accurate in a video that accompanied his tweet, but data on childhood cancer mortality rates around the world is lacking \u2014 both in terms of cases that go undiagnosed and infrastructure in place to measure mortality. Estimates that do exist suggest that the mortality rate for children with cancer in developing countries is between 70% and 90%. These studies look at children within their lifetimes, not mortality rates within a single year, as McCaul\u2019s tweet suggested. Overall, McCaul\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"Over the last eight years, we\u2019ve shown that even though we\u2019ve cut taxes by $8 billion, revenues continue to grow.\"",
        "doc": "Editor\u2019s Note: This item was updated March 22, 2019, with the rating changed from Half True to True, based on additional research and to remain consistent with past ratings given to similar claims. The budget battle is raging in Madison, where new Gov. Tony Evers is seeking to make his mark on the state and Republicans are making the case that fiscal policies enacted under all-GOP control are worth continuing. State Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, co-chair of the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, hammered that point in a string of tweets on Feb. 12, 2019, including one that claimed Wisconsin\u2019s financial outlook \"is the strongest in a generation.\" But it was atweet later in the string that caught our eye: \"Over the last eight years, we\u2019ve shown that even though we\u2019ve cut \u2026 taxes by $8 billion, revenues continue to grow,\" Nygren said. Revenue generally comes from, well, taxes, so can one go up while the other goes down that much? Let\u2019s see if the numbers add up. There are two parts to this claim \u2014 that taxes were cut by $8 billion and that revenues are growing. Tax cuts get complicated, so let\u2019s warm up the revenue side of the equation. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau\u2019sreport on tax collections shows consistent growth in recent years. Going back eight years to 2010-\u201911 -- the period referenced in Nygren\u2019s claim -- the state\u2019s overall general fund tax collection has grown every year but one. The revenue increase was generally 3 to 4 percent annually, with the exception of 2013-\u201914. That year revenue dropped slightly after the Legislature implemented a series of tax cuts. Overall from 2010-\u201911 to 2017-\u201918, general fund tax collections rose from $12.9 billion to $16.1 billion. And they\u2019re expected to rise to $16.6 billion in 2018-\u201919 according to thelatest fiscal bureau estimate. So, yes, revenues have grown. As proof of the $8 billion cut cited by Nygren, his staff provided a fiscal bureau memo that listed changes to a variety of taxes since 2011. They include things like health savings accounts, farm loss limit, sales tax exemptions and technical college funding. The chart tallies up the tax changes relative to the 2010-\u201911 level across the eight-year span. So if a tax dropped by $1 million the first year and stayed at that same level each of the next seven years, it is counted as an $8 million \"cut\" over the eight-year span \u2014 since the total is $8 million below where it would have been if the 2010-\u201911 level remained in place each year. The taxes paid in this simplified example would only get lower once, in the first year. But the approach used in the memo \u2014 and by Nygren \u2014 counts the savings generated each year relative to the 2010-\u201911 level. The tally shows $4.8 billion in reductions to income and franchise taxes and a $3.6 billion reduction in property taxes compared to the 2010-\u201911 baseline. The property tax reductions cited are not given directly to taxpayers, they are sent to local municipalities. Local officials could choose to cut property taxes by an identical amount and pass those savings on to taxpayers, but that doesn\u2019t always happen. That property tax relief did reduce taxes that otherwise would have been paid, though. Experts disagree on whether it\u2019s correct to call all these changes tax \"cuts,\" since it counts reductions in multiple years when the level of the tax is only \"cut\" once. But the net effect is to cut the amount of tax paid. And we\u2019ve rated claims in this vein True in the past. In 2015, we rated then-Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s statement True when he used the same approach from the fiscal bureau to refer to what was then $4.7 billion in tax cuts. We gave Walker another True in 2017 for referring to what would become $8 billion in \"tax cuts.\" And we gave Walker a True for using the figure on the campaign trail in June 2018, touting it as \"$8 billion in cumulative tax relief.\" Nygren\u2019s verbiage calling that tally a \"tax cut\" differed from Walker\u2019s statement in 2018 but is in line with how Walker referred to it in our 2015 and 2017 fact checks Nygren said under eight years of Republican leadership Wisconsin has \"cut taxes\" by $8 billion while revenues have risen. The revenues portion of the statement is clearly accurate. The tax cut element is a bit more nuanced, but the changes Republicans made did result in a net savings of $8 billion for taxpayers compared to if the 2010-\u201911 tax levels had remained in place. And we\u2019ve rated very similar claims as True in the past. We rate Nygren\u2019s statement True.",

        "doc": "A post on Facebook claims that the \"relatively unknown 1939 Cancer Act\" states that the disease can only be cured with chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, and anyone who claims to have used a different cure \"is liable for prosecution\". This isn't true. While the Cancer Act 1939 is a real piece of legislation and is still in use\u2014in part\u2014today, it doesn't ban medical professionals from offering other forms of treatment and it doesn't stop people from claiming to have cured the disease through alternative means. We have written before about false claims that the Act prevents research into alternative cures for cancer, and misleading claims about the legislation are so widespread that Cancer Research UK has explained it in detail on its site. Misinterpretations of the Act have previously been the subject of petitions to government and Parliament. These petitions have been rejected, under the reasoning that \"no UK law or Government policy prevents medical personnel in the UK from discussing or investigating potential cancer treatments\". Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in Legislation only stops cancer treatments being advertised to the public Predating the formation of the NHS by almost a decade, the Cancer Act 1939 originally specified how cancer treatments should be paid for , and how those treatments should be administered across the country. One of the intentions of the Cancer Act 1939 was to \" prohibit certain advertisements relating to cancer \". In the intervening decades the Act has changed substantially , but the rules on advertising\u2014contained in Section 4 \u2014largely remain in place. The law as it stands today means that nobody can advertise cancer treatments for sale to the general public in order to protect consumers. (They can still advertise treatments to Members of Parliament, medical practitioners and local authorities.) This isn't just limited to unproven or unconventional treatments. The ban on advertising extends to all treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation. This doesn't prevent people from claiming that an alternative treatment has been used to cure cancer, it just means that they can't advertise that treatment. Cancer Research UK says \"Implicit in the term 'advertisement' is that there is a financial incentive.\" To give a practical example, if someone claimed that a specific type of diet plan cured cancer, they would be able to publish an article in a scientific journal explaining their proposed treatment under the Act. They would not, however, be allowed to advertise their diet plan directly to consumers. Image courtesy of the National Cancer Institute .",

        "claim": "Potatoes treated with Monitor are stored in atmosphere-controlled sheds for six weeks after harvesting because they are inedible and need to \"off-gas\" the chemicals.",
        "doc": "Several social media posts claim that a pesticide called Monitor is used to grow potatoes for McDonald's french fries. But this is not true in the UK, EU and US at least, where the pesticide has not been approved for use for years. Many of the posts quote claims that were originally made by journalist and author Michael Pollan in a speech at a Royal Society of Arts event in 2013 . Some posts link to footage of him speaking and have thousands of shares. But these posts fail to explain that Monitor has not been approved for use in the US since 2009 and the EU since 2008. McDonald's USA told Full Fact that the chemical had not been used on its potatoes for \"several years\", and Mr Pollan also told us it was no longer used in the US, adding that his 2013 account was based on reporting he had carried out in the late 1990s. Full Fact has previously written about false and misleading online claims relating to food and drink, such as that maggots are allowed in orange juice in the US and that water is poisoning residents in Greater Manchester. Misinformation like this can create unnecessary alarm, uncertainty and distrust about what is safe to consume. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What did Mr Pollan say in 2013? In his speech, which is quoted in many of the posts, Mr Pollan said McDonald's insists that all its fries are made from Russet Burbank potatoes. He went on to claim that only a pesticide called Monitor can protect these potatoes from \" net necrosis \", which creates the brown blemishing sometimes seen on the vegetables and is a symptom of a viral infection spread by aphids (insects that suck the sap of plants ). Monitor is a trade name for a chemical called methamidophos , which has historically been used as an insecticide on a variety of crops. In the EU , this included tomatoes, soybeans, tobacco, sugar and cotton among others, while in the US this included cotton, potatoes and tomatoes. Methamidophos is classed as ' highly hazardous ' by the World Health Organisation and stopped being registered for use as a pesticide in the US in 2009. McDonald's USA confirmed to Full Fact that Monitor has not been used on its potatoes for \"several years\". Fact checking organisation Politifact has also pointed to the absence of methamidophos in a video commissioned by McDonald's as part of a 2014 promotional campaign to explain the 19 ingredients used to make its french fries. Methamidophos has also not been approved for use in the EU since 2008, and this has continued to be the case in the UK since Brexi t. McDonald's UK's website says all pesticides used to grow its potatoes are approved under EU legislation and that its suppliers do not use pesticides containing methamidophos. While we know Monitor is not used in the UK, EU and US, we have not been able to verify whether it could be in use anywhere else in the world. We have asked McDonald's about this and will update this fact check when we hear back. 'No-entry zone' Several posts also claim that farmers have to observe a \"no-entry zone\" after spraying Monitor. Mr Pollan claimed in the video from 2013 that \"Monitor is so toxic that the farmers who grow these potatoes in Idaho won't venture outside into their fields for five days after they spray\". This is missing context\u2014the practice is a standard safety protocol carried out after any pesticides are used. Politifact reports that commercial farms in the US are required to observe a \" restricted-entry interval \" (REI) for a period immediately after a pesticide is applied. The length of time varies depending on the crop, specific pesticide and the amount of human contact required for the agricultural activity, varying between 12 hours or multiple days. When it was previously approved for use, the REI for methamidophos in the US was four days for potatoes. Potatoes don't need to 'off-gas' Some of the posts we've seen share another claim mentioned in Mr Pollan's speech\u2014that the harvested potatoes are \"not edible\" for six weeks and need to be kept in \"atmosphere-controlled sheds\" to \"off-gas all the chemicals\". According to the Office for Science and Technology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, the notion that potatoes have to be stored to \"off gas toxins\" is \"pure nonsense\". It says potatoes are routinely stored that way to make sure they are available all year round. Crops grown or imported into the UK are monitored to ensure any traces of pesticides are within safe levels. What does Mr Pollan say? We contacted Mr Pollan to alert him to the claims now circulating. He said: \"It's true that Monitor is no longer in use in the US. My account is based on reporting I did in the late nineties. I'm glad you will be updating it.\" Image courtesy of Dinkun Chen",

        "claim": "\"In (Sen. Marco) Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty.\"",
        "doc": "Sen. Marco Rubio, in arecent speechfrom the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, said Social Security and Medicare \"weakened us as a people.\"We used to take care of one another, and our neighbors, until government took over, he explained.Liberal MSNBC pundit Ed Schultz called that \"Psychotalk.\"It's a segment on the Ed Show he uses to scorn comments by politicians and other pundits,most recentlyDonald Trump, Jon Huntsman, Mitt Romney and George Will. On Aug. 25, he challenged the star Florida conservative,calling him a political hackwho wants to get rid of social safety nets. (Rubio, for his part, said in the speech he believes in America's retirement programs, but that they must be changed for those who aren't in them yet to make them sustainable.)A Florida statistic during the segment caught our attention: \"In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty.\" PolitiFact Florida wanted to know, is that true? (We also checkeda statement by Rubiofrom the same speech about the ratio of workers to retirees in the Social Security program dipping from 16 to 1 down to 3 to 1.)On its face, the number seems plausible. Social Security benefits,set up as a result of a 1935 lawsigned by President Franklin Roosevelt, helped support52 millionretired and disabled workers and their relatives in 2009, according to the agency that administers them.But who provided Schultz's number?We took a closer look at a Nexis transcript, which we edited slightly afterwatching the segment ourselves: SCHULTZ: And in Psychotalk tonight, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, he's on the attack against the Big Three. Now Rubio is an early favorite to take the No. 2 spot on the Republican presidential ticket next year thanks to his tea party ideology and his pretty boy looks. But his policies are downright ugly.During a speech at the Reagan Library this week, Rubio had this to say about programs like Social Security and Medicare.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them.You saved for your retirement and for your future because you had to. \u2026 But all of that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. ... And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people.(END VIDEO CLIP)SCHULTZ: I will tell you what's weakening our people: political hacks like Marco Rubio, who want to get rid of social safety nets. Before Medicare -- check this out -- half of American seniors didn't have hospital insurance. Almost a third of Americans lived in poverty.But after Medicare was signed into law, the poverty rate among senior citizens plummeted from 30 percent to around 10 percent in just 30 years. And it's the same story with Social Security.According to the Census Bureau data, 20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist. Forty five percent of senior citizens would be poor.And in Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty. But these right wingers remain determined to dismantle the Big Three, no matter how many Americans suffer.For Marco Rubio to say programs like Medicare and Social Security weaken Americans is flat out Psychotalk.For this fact-check, we're setting aside the national statistics Schultz offered about Medicare and Social Security and focusing on his Florida claim.Where did the Florida statistic come from? Schultz had said in a previous paragraph, \"according to Census Bureau data,\" and a spokeswoman for his show, Tanya Hayre, confirmed \"we source the Census Bureau in our reporting.\"But a graphic on the screen as Schultz spoke gave a different source: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Wefound the report.It shows Schultz accurately repeated numbers from the think tank's 2010 analysis of Census data.The authors of the analysis, Paul Van de Water and Arloc Sherman, took the official definition of poverty used by the Census Bureau, then crunched Census-provided numbers on families' poverty status with and without Social Security benefits. Without Social Security, they found, 19.8 million more Americans would have been poor in 2008, including 1.07 million in Florida. (The state numbers relied on a three-year average for 2006-08, to boost the reliability of the results.)So far, so good, for Schultz.But whenever someone cites government data but, in fact, is relying on analysis of that data by a think tank, we check to see whether other experts interpret the same data differently. For example, in July Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.,cited the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Officein a claim about the effect of tax cuts on the national debt -- when her conclusion came from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In that case it turned out that conservative think tanks used the same CBO numbers to support a different conclusion. We ultimately rated her statement Half True.In this case, Van de Water and Sherman named in their report a conservative critic of their analysis, Charles Blahous, one of two public trustees of Social Security and Medicare and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. We traded e-mails with him. We also called up Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research.A note: These people all know each other. Biggs and Van de Water worked together at the Social Security Administration while Blahous was a special assistant to the president for economic policy focusing on \"retirement security issues.\" Now they all work at think tanks, helping shape how we view public policy. And as Van de Water put it, \"We worked together, but we disagree on a number of things.\"Indeed.Here's what Biggs and Blahous say about Van de Water's analysis: It's meaningless and misleading.\"The SSA used to publish these figures but stopped because they were deceptive, so now the lefty think tanks calculate the figures themselves,\" Biggs said. \"That says something!\"Van de Water confirmed the Social Security Administration used to do the same analysis while he was there but stopped early into President George W. Bush's administration -- because of views like Blahous'. So the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities started computing the the poverty figures, using the same methodology, he said.What do Blahous and Biggs find misleading?The analysis focuses on benefits only, not the years and years of payroll taxes that families fed into the system. What if those tax dollars had stayed in workers' pockets? Would they still face poverty?\"To make any reasonable statements about the program's net effect on poverty, one needs to come up with a model for how high poverty would be without each of Social Security benefits or taxes,\" Blahous said. He says to get a truer sense of the program's current effect, you would have to consult studieslike thesefrom the Social Security actuary. In the early years of Social Security, its effect on poverty was much greater -- workers got out in benefits much more than they paid in taxes. It offered a windfall to early beneficiaries at the expense of later ones. But look at Tables 2 or 3 in the actuary's July 2010 publication, he said, and you see that would shift if the program raises taxes or cuts benefits, as it would need to to fully finance benefits more than 25 years from now. For example, low-wage single males born in 1937 or later -- retiring this century -- would actually get out less than they put in. (Very low-wage males, plus females and couples would fare better longer.)As an aside, that crunch will continue asfewer and fewer workers support more retirees. Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration had todip into its trust fundseveral years earlier than anticipated, in part because of the economy. Still, as PolitiFact has ruled twice, it'swrongto say the program'sout of money.That makes it all the more misleading, Blahous and Biggs say, to claim that Social Security lifts more than a million people out of poverty in Florida based on analysis of benefits only. They might not have been in poverty if not for the taxes they paid, and for some it would have been a better deal to invest directly in Treasury bonds rather than in the Social Security system. \"I'm sure it does reduce poverty, but not by anything like they're talking about,\" Biggs said. \"... They're looking at one side of an equation in a very simplistic way.\"Is that the whole story? Not quite.Let's say low-income workers -- presumably at higher risk for poverty in retirement -- didn't have to pay Social Security taxes. Would they carefully put aside that amount? It's more likely they would spend it, Van de Water said. Not only that, Social Security is designed topay out more to low-income workersthan they put in. In other words, letting them keep their payroll taxes wouldn't support them as well as providing them Social Security checks.\"It's clear that Social Security keeps lots of low-income elderly out of poverty in retirement,\" Van de Water said.He acknowledges his analysis answers a very narrow question: How many people would fall into poverty if Social Security checks stopped today? It's not as good for answering the broader question: What if Social Security had never existed at all?And of course, that's not an easy question to answer, said another expert, Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.\"If we had no Social Security, people would have to work longer, save more, become more financially literate, buy annuities and private disability insurance, contribute to their own IRAs and pensions, and probably rely more on family and charity if they were hoping to retire,\" she said. \"We can't easily run the counterfactual experiment!\"Yet it's the broader question that Schultz suggests on his MSNBC show in his setup for the Florida statistic. He says, \"20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist.\" If it had disappeared into thin air one day in 2008, sure. If it had never come into being? Much tougher to say.So when he says, \"In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty,\" he's accurately quoting a study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities about what would happen if Social Security checks suddenly stopped. But the statistic doesn't directly address Rubio's apparent point, that America would be stronger if FDR had never signed Social Security into existence. That's a matter for thoughtful speculation or a raft of much more complicated studies. We also found it misleading that Schultz mentioned just the Census Bureau as his source, while graphics on the screen in small type confirmed the numbers were in fact crunched by a think tank. For those reasons, we find he used the statistic out of context, and rate it Half True.",

        "doc": "Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist\u2019s past positions as a Republican lawmaker are being brought back to light as Crist seeks to return to elected office as a Democrat. Crist is challenging incumbent Rep. David Jolly, R-Belleair Bluffs, for Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District, which includes Pinellas County at the western edge of Florida\u2019s pivotal I-4 corridor. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he\u2019d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist\u2019s proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s. Jolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida\u2019s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. \"You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight,\" Jolly said to Crist. Jolly closed by asking, \"Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?\" Crist said \"it was beneath\" Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time. \"In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America,\" Crist said. \"The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds,\" Crist added. In a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly\u2019s story about Crist\u2019s visit to Alabama. Here, we are looking at Crist\u2019s rebuttal. When it comes to the facts, Crist is correct on both statistics. Crist\u2019scampaign directed us to data from the Disaster Center, which used FBI Uniform Crime Reports to compare violent crime across states. The data shows from 1991 to 1997, Florida was ranked No. 1 for the rate of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. To calculate the rate of violent crime, you take the total number for each of the violent crime categories (murder, rape, robbery and assault) for every 100,000 population in that year. In 1998, Florida was ranked No. 2., with New Mexico earning the top spot. The number of violent crimes decreased in Florida throughout the 1990s, mirroring a national trend. As for Crist\u2019s other statistic, it was actually happening more often than he said for most of the decade. The year 1993 marked Crist\u2019s first year in the Florida Senate and a record-high amount of violent crimes (161,789). According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, a violent crime happened every three minutes and 14 seconds. The figure stretched to three minutes and 19 seconds in 1994, and then to three minutes and 28 seconds in 1995. In 1998, violent crimes were occurring every three minutes and 45 seconds \u2014 what Crist said. In 2015, violent crimes happened every five minutes and 37 seconds. Our ruling Crist said, \"in the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds.\" Crist is correct on both factual claims. Florida led the nation in the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 population in the mid 1990s. And Florida did see a violent crime committed every three minutes and 45 seconds. In fact, for many years in the 1990s, a violent crime was committed even more often. We rate Crist\u2019s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95fa7bae-0471-4b13-aa94-917cbebbda9f",

        "claim": "\"In 2008, candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare.\"",
        "doc": "As the presidential campaigns trade attacks about Medicare, a new TV ad from Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of hypocrisy.The ad says that in 2008, Obama attacked his opponent, U.S. Sen. John McCain, for wanting to cut Medicare -- and then did so himself to to pay for Obamacare.The ad uses a clip of Obama speaking at a campaign rally in October 2008.\"Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth,\" Obama says from a podium.The ad then says Obama \"cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare\" -- a claim PolitiFact previously rated Half True -- and concludes with another clip of Obama saying \"it ain\u2019t right.\"\"No, Mr. President,\" the announcer says, \"it ain't right.\"Here, we\u2019ll rewind to 2008 to see how candidate Obama handled the delicate topic of Medicare. It turns out we fact-checked Obama's claim back then.Rallying voters in VirginiaWe went back to a transcript of the 2008 event to make sure Obama's comments were not taken out of context. Speaking before a crowd of more than 8,000 on Oct. 17, 2008, Obama unloaded on McCain\u2019s Medicare proposal, according to a transcript of the event:\"It turns out, Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth, $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care, to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall.\"Now, this should come as no surprise. It's entirely consistent with Sen. McCain's record during his 26 years in Congress, where time and again he's opposed Medicare. In fact, Sen. McCain has voted against protecting Medicare 40 times -- 40 times, he's failed to stand up for Medicare.\"So what would Sen. McCain's cuts mean for Medicare, at a time when more and more Americans are relying on it? It would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year.\"If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to get care and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs. You'll receive fewer services. You'll get lower-quality care.\"I don't think that's right. In fact, it ain't right. (Cheers.) When you've worked hard your whole life and pay into the system and done everything right, you shouldn't have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it.\"An ad, and ensuing criticismBack in 2008, the Obama campaign released a television ad making the same basic claim.\"How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?\" the announcer said in the 2008 ad. \"His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion. That means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays. More expensive prescription drugs. Nursing home care could suffer. ... After a lifetime of work, seniors' health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan? It's not the change we need.\"PolitiFact examined the claim from Obama\u2019s speech about McCain\u2019s Medicare plan and rated it False.\"McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps,\" we wrote.While not the same in every detail, McCain\u2019s ideas for cost savings sound an awful lot like the ones Obama has pursued as president.The New York Times was similarly critical of the 2008 ad, saying it \"does mischaracterize Mr. McCain's plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back-of-the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group.\"Our ruling Romney\u2019s new ad says \"candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare.\"That's an accurate description of what Obama said. We rate Romney's claim True.",

        "claim": "Two vehicles shown in the video have been used to keep hundreds of EVMs in the strong room in the Sabzi Mandi area of Madhya Pradesh",
        "doc": "A video is getting viral on Facebook in which it is claimed that Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have been involved with Election Commission. It is further claimed that two vehicles shown in the video have been used to keep hundreds of EVMs in the strong room in the Sabzi Mandi area of Madhya Pradesh. It further claims that during the counting of votes, discrepancies have been reported. Vishvas News investigated the viral video and its claim and found that the viral news is fake. Claim: The viral video claims that Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have been involved with the Election Commission. According to the claim, some vehicles shown in the video (a school bus and a jeep) have been used to keep hundreds of EVMs in the strong room in the Sabzi Mandi area of Madhya Pradesh. Also, there were discrepancies in the counting of votes. The video was uploaded by a Facebook user \u2018Munirul Shekh\u2019. The video has around 15000 reactions, 1,080 comments, and 88,056 shares. Investigation: We started our investigation by breaking down various elements of the claim. We looked at the comments of the viral video. We searched with news from any reliable source regarding Narendra Modi and Amish Shah involvement in EVM scam but couldn\u2019t find any. Many users commented on the video that it is fake. We saw the video and heard its voice over. It was claimed that the EVM incident happened in Meena Bazaar of Madhya Pradesh. We searched Google using the keywords \u2018EVM incident in Meena Bazaar Madhya Pradesh\u2019. But, we did not get any related news. If this incident actually happened, many websites would have covered it. As per the claim in the video, a school bus shown in the image was used to carry EVMs in Madhya Pradesh. On the school bus the name of the school \u2018Harford County Public Schools\u2019 was written. We searched the school name on Google and found that Harford County Public School Harford County Public Schools is an American public school system serving the residents of Harford County, Maryland. We took the screenshot of the photo of the bus and performed Google Reverse Image Search. We found a Youtube link where the same image was used in a video. It is clear that the bus does not run in Madhya Pradesh. To re-confirm, we also searched the address of Harford County Public Schools and found that this isn\u2019t from India. The video further claimed that a jeep (as shown in the video) was also used to carry EVMs. When we searched the number of the jeep we found that the vehicle is registered in Lucknow. We performed a reverse image search to find the exact image of the jeep. We found the same image on a website in which vehicles are bought and sold. We called up the number mentioned below the image. But, we could not get any information related to the vehicle. But one thing became clear that this vehicle is not of Madhya Pradesh as claimed in the viral video. Then we performed the reverse image search of the EVM machine shown in the video. We found that the EVM image used in the video is used by many other websites as a representational image. We contacted the Election Commission of India to ask whether any such incident happened. An official stated: This is a fake news. Nothing as such happened in Madhya Pradesh. Using StalkScan we checked the profile of the Facebook user \u2018Munirul Shekh\u2019 and found many such misleading posts. Conclusion: The two vehicles shown in the video haven\u2019t been used to keep hundreds of EVMs in the strong room in the Sabzi Mandi area of Madhya Pradesh. The claim and the video are false.

        "claim": "\"Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job.\"",
        "doc": "Secretly recorded video of Mitt Romney grabbed attention on Sept. 17, 2012, primarily for his claim that 47 percent of Americans \"believe they are victims\" entitled to government help.But there\u2019s more to the video snippets of Romney speaking privately to big Florida donors in Boca Raton. As the Republican presidential candidate explained his approach to wooing independent voters, he reeled off a series of statistics about the disappointing economy. We\u2019re checking several statements from Romney\u2019s remarks on May 17, 2012, but here we\u2019re asking whether, \"Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job.\" Fifty percent of kidsRomney has made similar remarks on the campaign trail before, and his campaign has pointed us to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates.The key piece of evidence is from the Associated Press article, \"In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed.\" It\u2019s based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs.Here\u2019s how the AP summarized the findings:\"A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs \u2013 waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example \u2013 and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ...\"About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. \u2026 Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year.\"Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren\u2019t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed, and about half are in jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree.In August, PolitiFact checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis.Romney would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim the way he did on other occasions, when he said \"half the kids coming out of college this year \u2026 can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree.\"We also think there\u2019s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn\u2019t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities.According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- \"before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields.\" That\u2019s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets.While Romney glossed over details when he spoke with donors, painting a darker picture than supported by the research, he did get the tone right: At 53.6 percent, the number of college graduates unemployed or underemployed is the highest it\u2019s been in at least 11 years. Our rulingRomney told campaign donors that \"50 percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job.\" He missed a key qualifier -- according to the research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can\u2019t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn\u2019t require a college degree. Still, the research shows the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade. We rate the claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Rick Perry thinks \"injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug (the HPV vaccine), without a parent's consent, is a good idea.\"",
        "doc": "Zeroing in on Gov. Rick Perry's long tenure in public office, Lone Star First, an organization that's funded and supported by the Democratic Governors Association, unleashed an attack ad called \"Cracks.\" It features a photo of Perry that splinters more with each charge the association levels against him. \"Twenty-five years as a politician changes you,\" a narrator says in the ad posted on YouTube Sept. 28. \"You think injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug, without a parent's consent, is a good idea. You think it's right to use a government takeover of Texas homes and property so foreign companies can get rich. You spend taxpayer money on a fancy mansion while Texas faces an $18 billion deficit. On the issues, 25 years as a politician has changed Rick Perry, for the worse.\" We've previously touched on Perry's past advocacy of a toll-road network, his rental digs and the budgetshortfall. Now we wondered about Texas girls receiving a \"controversial drug\" without parental consent. On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order that required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating that Texas girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Certain types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young. Lawmakers blocked the plans, and earlier this year, Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, told us that the governor's office considers the mandate \"null and void.\" She said Perry \"will not pursue it in the future.\" At the time, we ratedBarely TruePerry's statement that his executive order didn't make the vaccine mandatory. But did Perry's move mean children would receive shots without parental consent? Brannon Jordan, a spokesman at the Democratic Governors Association, pointed us to three news articles to back up the statement. While the articles quoted parents expressing anger at Perry for requiring something they considered none of his business, none of the clips mention parental consent. The mandate, which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2008-09 school year, included an opt-out \"in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care.\" It ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman at the Health and Human Services Commission, told us that \"the child would only get the vaccination if the parent took the child to get it.\" Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman at the Department of State Health Services, said: \"Vaccines cannot be given to children without consent of a parent or a legal guardian.\" Texas law lists two primary people who can consent the immunization of a child \u2014 the guardian and a person authorized under the law of another state or a court \u2014 and secondary people if the former are unavailable, including a grandparent, stepparent, or aunt. Janet Realini, a physician and president of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based nonprofit striving to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancies, told us that the mandate would have been no different than state requirements for numerous immunizations that Texas requires children need to attend public school, such as the polio vaccine, measles and hepatitis B. When we checked back with the DGA, spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that she wasn't familiar with the ad. We asked to speak with someone who was, but no one had gotten back to us as we were wrapping up our research. Where does that leave us? Perry's executive order would have required Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering sixth grade. The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine. But there's no evidence \u2014 not a scintilla of proof \u2014 that shots would have been given without parental consent, and saying so preys on the fears of parents who objected to Perry requiring the vaccine. Parents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug.

        "claim": "\"Up until two weeks ago, John McCain was a leading proponent of amnesty. Now with me challenging him, suddenly he has changed.\"",
        "doc": "During a recent interview on the FoxBusiness Network, J.D. Hayworth, the former U.S. representative who is running against incumbent John McCain for U.S. Senate from Arizona, saidMcCain has recently changed his tune on immigration.\"Up until two weeks ago, John McCain was a leading proponent of amnesty. Now with me challenging him, suddenly he has changed,\" Hayworthtold host Neil CavutoonApril 28, 2010.Hayworth made the comment during a larger discussion about Arizona's new immigration law, one that would make it a state crime to be an illegal immigrant. Immigration reform has many components, and we found McCain has changed his position on at least one of them. But did he change positions on amnesty after Hayworth entered the race? That's the question we're setting out to answer. For those of you who don't know about McCain's record on immigration, here's the skinny: Back in 2007, McCain made waves by pushing an immigration reform bill that would have created a pathway to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally. Such a plan has been unpopular with many Republicans, who frequently criticize it for providing \"amnesty\" to illegal aliens. Since then, McCain's rhetoric on the issue has shifted.For instance, in a Jan. 30, 2008, presidential debate, McCain was asked whether he would still vote in support of his 2007 proposal. He dodged the question, and instead said border security should come first. \"We will secure the borders first when I am president of the United States,\" he said.Indeed, McCain was long against the idea of sending National Guard troops to the border. In 2001, he told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that it was a bad idea because troops are not trained for the job. He solidified his change of heart on March 26, 2009, when he posted a statement on his Web site that said, given violence along the U.S.-Mexico border, \"I support sending National Guard troops to assist with securing our southern border and stemming the flow of violence spilling over into the United States.\"He reiterated that stance during a field hearing in Phoenix on Monday, April 20, 2009. And exactly a year later, McCain joined with fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to introduce a 10-point plan to secure the border. The proposal includes sending 3,000 National Guard troops to the border, but says nothing about a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens.McCain has even acknowledged the change of heart, telling O'Reilly on April 19, 2010, that, \"I changed [my mind] over a year ago, as you know. The violence on the border is incredible.\"At the same time, McCain has come out in favor of the Arizona immigration law, which has generated some flack from immigration reform advocates. They say he's bowing to campaign pressure. Furthermore, McCain has not stepped forward to support a Democratic immigration reform proposal that includes a pathway to citizenship similar to the plan included in McCain's 2007 bill. So, we can safely say that McCain has decided that putting National Guard troops on the border is a good idea after all. But that's not a new development; he changed course on the issue over a year ago. We can also say that McCain has endorsed the Arizona law, which has surprised immigration reform advocates who have typically seen McCain as an ally. And we can say that he's not endorsed a Democratic immigration reform effort. But does McCain now think a pathway to citizenship is no longer an option he'd support?No, says Brian Rogers, McCain's campaign spokesman. \"He's said that once the borders are secure, then we should look to other elements of reform, including a path to citizenship, to be addressed,\" Rogers said. Indeed, over the past few weeks, McCain said just that.\"After the border is secure, then we need to look at a temporary legal guest worker program and a path to citizenship and all that. But first, the border has to be secured,\" he said.We asked Hayworth's campaign to pinpoint the flip they say McCain made in recent weeks, and Hayworth's spokesman, Mark Sanders, said that he believed that McCain was running ads that indicated a change of heart. We did find several recent campaign ads and radio spots on McCain's campaign Web site; they all tout McCain and Kyl's border security plan, but say nothing about immigration reform or a pathway to citizenship. And Sanders could not give us further information on the ads he told us about.Sanders also pointed us to an ad put together by Hayworth's campaign. It pieces together clips of McCain recently talking about border security with comments he made previously about immigration reform. The first clip is from a speech McCain gave in 2008 to the National Council of La Raza, according to the Hayworth campaign. The second, which features the lateMeet the Press host Tim Russert reading a positive statement McCain made about immigration reform in 2003, is at leasttwo years old (Russert died in June2008). The third is from a debate during the presidential campaign.But none are recent statements. So let's recap: McCain was once a vocal proponent of a pathway to citizenship. And for years, he rejected the idea of sending more National Guard troops to the border. But during the 2008 campaign, he started to shift his stance on the issue, saying that securing the border was his first priority. We found that he's maintained that stance since 2008, most recently with a new plan that would send 3,000 National Guard troops to the border. All the while, McCain has never fully backed away from further immigration reform, though we do concede that he's clearly put the issue on the back burner.But there is nothing to substantiate Hayworth's claim that, \"Up until two weeks ago, John McCain was a leading proponent of amnesty. Now with me challenging him, suddenly he has changed.\" And his campaign could point to no solid evidence to back him up. In fact, McCain started favoring border security over a pathway to citizenship years ago, long before Hayworth was a contender. As a result, we find Hayworth's claim to be Pants on Fire.",

        "doc": "A Facebook post that claims a Chicago police officer shot a teenager \"53 times\" for sneaking into a gym is a malicious distortion of what actually happened. In reality, the police officer helped the teen buy a gym membership. The Facebook post, which displays a photograph of the officer and his full name, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The real story originated in August 2017, according to the Chicago Tribune, when a teen around 15 years old was warned that if he continued to sneak onto the basketball court of the XSport Fitness facility in Skokie, Ill., just north of Chicago, the police would be called. The gym\u2019s staff eventually alerted the Skokie Police Department after the boy attempted to get in again. Valenti responded, and when he found out the teen had a membership that expired after his mother couldn\u2019t afford it anymore, \"he offered to pay $150 out of his own pocket, asking fitness center workers how much membership time that would buy for the boy,\" the Tribune reported. It covered up to about four months, but after the gym\u2019s corporate office found out about the situation, they said the $150 would go toward a two-year membership, instead, with the gym picking up the rest of the cost. The false Facebook post includes Valenti\u2019s full name and photo and appears to be the same photo published by the Tribune. In the post\u2019s caption, it\u2019s obvious the original text was erased and the part that says he \"shot him 53 times\" was inserted, as the text size and style doesn\u2019t visually match up with the rest of the sentence.

Another member of Mueller\u2019s team -- Aaron Zelinsky -- has been reported to be a registered Democrat by both the Washington Post and the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller also reported that Zelinsky wrote, \"I\u2019m a Democrat,\" in a Huffington Post column supporting same-sex marriage in November 2012. In the meantime, we were able to independently confirm that two other members of Mueller\u2019s staff -- Scott Meisler and Aaron Zebley -- are registered to vote but have not chosen a party affiliation. We were unable to independently confirm the status of two other staff members, Zainab Ahmad and Brian M. Richardson. According to the Daily Caller, Ahmad \"appears to have registered as a Republican at the age of 18, but has since changed her registration status to unaffiliated.\" We\u2019ll also note that in the jurisdictions in which the Mueller lawyers live -- primarily the District of Columbia, Maryland and New York -- the Democrats are the dominant party, meaning that many races are effectively decided in Democratic primaries rather than in the general election. However, Trump\u2019s assertion that there are no Republicans on the team is undercut by the fact that its leader is Mueller, who is registered as a Republican in the District of Columbia. Mueller was appointed to offices by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In addition, Mueller was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, who was nominated for deputy attorney general by Trump himself, and who previously was appointed as a U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush (and later kept on by Obama). The Daily Caller has also reported that Mueller has occasionally donated to Republicans in both statewide and national races. Fox News has referred to Mueller as the \"only known Republican\" on the team. It\u2019s worth noting the importance of the word \"known,\" since other FBI or Justice Department personnel are assisting the investigation in certain capacities. The names of investigative and office support personnel have not been made public, the Special Counsel\u2019s office told PolitiFact. James D. Robenalt, a Cleveland lawyer who runs a continuing legal education class on Watergate and its lessons, said that FBI agents in particular are likely helping gather evidence. Agents \"come in all political stripes, though most are not active politically,\" Robenalt said. \"FBI agents, as most law enforcement, tend to be conservative, law-and-order types, so my guess is most would tend to be Republicans or conservative Democrats or just plain Independents.\" So Trump is using some sleight-of-hand to say that there are \"zero Republicans\" on Mueller\u2019s team. The team is led by a registered Republican, and there may be other registered Republicans working with Mueller whose identities the public simply doesn\u2019t know about. Trump has a point here, too, but it\u2019s worth keeping the scale of the donations in context. Two of the 13 publicly known Mueller staffers donated what might be characterized as \"big\" sums to Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign -- Quarles, with $2,700, and Rhee, with $5,400. During the 2016 campaign cycle, $2,700 was the maximum donation an individual could make to a campaign. Such a donation could be made twice -- once for the primary campaign and then again for the general election. A third member of the team, Weissmann, donated $2,300 to Clinton, but that was in 2007, when she was making her first presidential run. (The Daily Caller separately reported that he attended Clinton\u2019s election-night party in 2016.) Three other team members donated smaller amounts: $250 by Freeny and Prelogar, and $200 by Atkinson. How you define \"hardened\" is a judgment call. But if you measure by campaign donations, the point is overblown. Seven of the registered Democrats have no record of writing checks to federal candidates. Based on federal disclosure data, Quarles is easily the most generous donor on the team, giving in excess of $35,000 over the better part of two decades. Most of these donations went to Democratic candidates or entities, but it\u2019s worth noting that Quarles also made two donations totaling $2,750 to Republicans -- former Virginia Gov. George Allen and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz. He was the only team member to give donations to federal Republican candidates. The second-most generous team member was Rhee, who gave $11,950 to Democrats in federal races. Weissman ranked third, with $6,600, followed by Andres and Goldstein, both of whom gave in the mid-$3,000 range. Freeny, Prelogar, Van Grack and Atkinson also gave money in federal races, with donations from $200 to $800. The Daily Caller found additional donations totaling a little less than $12,000 in state and local races by eight of the staff members. These donations were to Democrats. So the donor on the team who gave the most money is also the only one to donate to Republican candidates as well. Four other staff members gave between $3,000 and $12,000 over a span of several years, four more gave donations only in the hundreds of dollars, and seven more didn\u2019t give any money at all in federal races. Mueller\u2019s team has thelegal right to register to vote with a party or by making personal donations. Such activities are protected under the Hatch Act, originally passed in 1939. It\u2019s also important to note that Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team. Both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act \"prohibit using political affiliation and may also prohibit using certain ideological affiliations in hiring and taking other personnel actions with regard to career attorneys,\" the department\u2019s inspector general has written. Moreover, the career attorneys on the Mueller team are bound by professional codes to pursue justice and rise above partisanship. Every federal employee swears an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States\" and \"bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\" Lawyers practicing in the federal courts swear a separate oath \"that as an attorney and as a counselor of this court, I will conduct myself uprightly and according to law, and that I will support the Constitution of the United States.\" Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in political law and government ethics at the firm Akerman LLP, said that in his experience, \"Justice Department lawyers tend to skew towards the Democrats while FBI agents are overwhelmingly Republican. Both of them take an oath to dispense justice without fear or favor with regard to political party, and I\u2019ve never seen anyone from either group act in a partisan way.\" \"I don\u2019t think one should ever ask about party affiliation when it comes to prosecutors,\" Robenalt added. \"They come in all stripes. The question is whether they are qualified \u2014 and as I understand it, the team assembled is highly qualified.\" Robenalt said he wouldn\u2019t advise young Justice Department lawyers to voluntarily eschew all political activity today for fear of getting attacked if they one day join a politically charged investigation. \"It is a First Amendment right and crucial to our democracy,\" he said. \"My guess is most will stay away from politics, but our country was built on the idea of freedom of belief and expression.\" One final point worth remembering is Trump's own history of donations to Clinton's U.S. Senate campaign (five, worth $4,100) and first presidential campaign (two, worth $2,300, though they were refunded in 2009.) Trump tweeted that Mueller\u2019s team has \"13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans.\" Mueller\u2019s team does have 13 registered Democrats and no registered Republicans, and several team members made donations to Clinton\u2019s campaign in various amounts. However, Trump leaves out a crucial registered Republican \u2014 Mueller himself \u2014 and glosses over the fact that we don\u2019t know the identities, or the partisan affiliation, of other Justice Department or FBI staff who are working with the investigation. It\u2019s also questionable to say that the multiple non-donors are \"hardened\" Democrats. We rate the statement Half True.

Mortal remains were wrapped in available local resources instead of improvised body bags or coffins.

        "claim": "In November 2016, a Twitter user correctly predicted that the 2021 NBA Finals would be contested by the Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks.",
        "doc": "In July 2021, several news outlets and social media posts reported that a Wisconsin man had correctly predicted the 2021 NBA Finals line-up of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Phoenix Suns \u2014 five years earlier. For example, WTMJ, a Milwaukee NBC affiliate, reported that: The Bucks are playing for their first championship in 50 years. The Phoenix Suns have never won an NBA title. So who would have predicted this NBA Finals match-up? Jarrett Plahmer did. The UW-Madison student sent out this prediction all the way back in 2016: \u201c2021 NBA finals Bucks vs Suns game 7 Bucks win 123-115.\u201d A similar article was published by the Milwaukee Fox affiliate WITI, and a widely-shared video posted by TikTok user @rundacourt included what appeared to be a screenshot of Plahmer\u2019s tweet: Plahmer\u2019s tweet was entirely authentic, and his five-year-old prediction was real. We are therefore issuing a rating of \u201cTrue.\u201d Plahmer posted the prediction to Twitter on November 3, 2016. An archived version of his tweet can be found here. Twitter has in the past confirmed for Snopes that it is not possible for users to edit or change the timestamp on a tweet, so Plahmer\u2019s prediction most certainly came in November 2016. In some senses, Plahmer\u2019s prediction is remarkable. Firstly, setting aside the relative strength and quality of the teams, their past records, and so on, the basic probability of correctly predicting the two finalists in any given year is one in 225, or 0.44% (since there are 15 teams in the Eastern conference, and 15 in the Western, and one finalist must come from each conference). Furthermore, Plahmer appears to have only ever made one NBA Finals prediction, based on our search of his Twitter account, which he started in 2016. Some people, especially sports fans, are pathological predictors, and make multiple incorrect forecasts for every one they happen to get right. That isn\u2019t the case with Plahmer, who appears to have a 100% record in correctly predicting NBA Finals line-ups. What\u2019s more, the two teams he picked hardly looked like contenders at that point. The Suns had the second-worst winning record in the Western conference in the 2015-16 season, and the Bucks had the fourth-worst in the Eastern. At the time Plahmer sent his tweet, the Suns had a 1-4 winning record in the 2016-17 season, and the Bucks a more respectable 3-2. In an interview with CNN in July 2021, Plahmer outlined the simple but sound logic behind his predicted match-up, explaining that, although sub-par back in November 2016, the Suns and Bucks (of which Plahmer is a fan) each had two especially promising players who, he thought, could lead their respective franchises to glory after five years of maturation and improvement: \u201cThe Suns had Devin Booker and Eric Bledsoe, and the Bucks had Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and Khris Middleton, and I said \u2018You know what, in five years maybe they\u2019ll both be there [in the NBA Finals].'\u201d Even then, though, Plahmer had to get the year right. He didn\u2019t predict the Suns and Bucks would meet in the 2020 finals, or in 2022, or in 2019 or 2023. He used his knowledge of two of his favorite teams\u2019 rosters, saw some potential, and correctly predicted the NBA Finals line-up in exactly five years\u2019 time. Whether the series reaches a seventh game, and whether the Bucks ultimately emerge victorious, as he also predicted, was yet to be seen as of this writing on July 16. In another sense, though, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising at all that someone, somewhere, correctly and publicly forecast the 2021 finals line-up, even from a distance of five years. Sports fans love to make predictions, and basketball aficionados are no different. What\u2019s more, there are millions of them active on social media platforms like Twitter. With that in mind, it\u2019s actually not that unlikely that, hidden among reams of incorrect calls, a handful of correct predictions would float to the surface. Searching only Twitter, we found the following examples relating to the two most recent sets of NBA Finals:",

        "doc": "Presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is taking credit for potentially sounding the death knell for Obamacare, claiming legislation he introduced eventually prevented Washington from giving billions of tax dollars to insurance companies. \"Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion,\" Rubio said in a Dec. 1, 2015, tweet. It linked to a Fox News story giving Rubio credit for dealing a blow to President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care legislation. Declaring he saved heaps of tax money and prevented a government bailout linked to a divisive law is a campaign coup for Rubio, who has risen to second among GOP candidates in the latest national Quinnipiac poll. But can he truly claim he kept billions from being used for a so-called bailout? Risk corridors rundown To set the table, we need to take a deep breath and go over a provision of the Affordable Care Act known as \"risk corridors.\" The ACA upended the traditional health insurance model of selling mostly to healthy people, mandating that insurers must provide policies to everyone, regardless of health or pre-existing conditions. That presented a problem for the companies, which didn\u2019t know how much they would need to charge in premiums in order to cover their expenses for all the new policies. To help companies stay solvent as they adjusted their rates to proper levels, the law provided a three-year period in which the government would spread the risk among all insurers in ACA marketplaces. This program, set to last between 2014-16, is known as risk corridors. If some insurers are successful in setting their marketplace rates properly and make more than a certain amount, Washington gets some of that extra money, referred to as user fees. Companies that don\u2019t do well have a portion of their losses covered by the government. Rubio has opposed the risk corridors since 2013, introducing legislation in the Senate to repeal the program. His bill didn\u2019t go anywhere, but Rubio continued to speak out against the provision, referring to the program as a \"bailout\" for unsuccessful insurance companies. But is it really a bailout? Several experts told us no, stressing that a bailout usually refers to a program used to save a company after the fact, not a mechanism in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan through Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage set up during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. The Part D program is a bit different than the ACA\u2019s version, but it was still designed to spread risk among insurers. \"Then, no one called it a bailout, when a new private insurance market was being created for Medicare drug benefits,\" said Mark Hall, a law and public health professor at Wake Forest University. But the problem with Obamacare\u2019s risk corridors is really about how it\u2019s funded. And that\u2019s the heart of Rubio\u2019s claim of saving taxpayer money. Funding fight The ACA did not specify where it was getting the money to cover any risk corridor payments. To get around this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they would keep the program budget-neutral by making payments strictly from the user fees successful insurers sent to the government. Rubio\u2019s concern has been that CMS promised in 2013 that \"regardless of the balance of payments and receipts\" in the program, insurers who said they needed money would get it. His point is that if there wasn\u2019t enough money to cover the payments, the Obama administration would ask Congress for money. But CMS said in April 2014 that it didn\u2019t plan to ask Congress for an appropriation. If they didn\u2019t take in enough money the first year, they would make it up in later years, when marketplaces hopefully stabilized enough to cover losses. To make sure CMS didn\u2019t ask for cash, Rubio wanted to cut off other sources of funding that could be used to pay off those companies. He urged then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential appropriations for risk corridor payments. When Congress passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included a sentence, or a \"rider\" in legislative speak, that said the CMS\u2019 parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not move money around in its budget to pay extra risk corridor expenses. Other legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language. Rubio has since reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors. Everyone had to wait until insurance companies turned in their results to see how the risk corridors were working. The first year didn\u2019t go as well as CMS and the Obama administration had hoped. In October 2015, CMS announced the risk corridors program took in $362 million for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion. That left a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can\u2019t pay. CMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014 this year, leading some insurers to leave the marketplaces or evencollapse altogether. Rubio now is on the campaign trail trumpeting the move as potentially being \"a big part of ending Obamacare for good.\" Some legal observers, however, doubt whether Rubio\u2019s efforts had any long-term effects. \"All the rider did is say, \u2018If you\u2019re going to go scrape the couch cushions for money to pay for this, don\u2019t,\u2019 \" Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, told PolitiFact Florida. \"The Rubio rider is preventing the administration from coming up with a workaround to a problem the law already had.\" There are still two years left in the risk corridors program, which the Congressional Budget Office said will likely eventually break even. If the program is in the red after 2016, CMS will either have to somehow find the money or ask Congress to decide whether to approve cash to pay the bill. Otherwise insurers could potentially sue to get what the law says they\u2019re owed. \"What he did is throw a wrench in the process,\" Bagley said of Rubio, who is trying to include the same kind of roadblock in the current spending bill. The deadline for that bill is Dec. 11. \"It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to assume those insurance companies are going to eventually want the money that was promised to them.\" Our ruling Rubio said, \"Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion.\" He\u2019s referring to a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors, which faced a $2.5 billion shortfall for 2014. Rubio, whose efforts to repeal risk corridors have so far failed, helped persuade Congress last year to prevent Health and Human Services from being able to cover the difference with money from its own budget. But experts said calling the program a bailout is not accurate. They also noted CMS has said they want the risk corridors to pay for themselves through fees from insurers. Most importantly, experts also said Rubio did not necessarily save that money in the long run. His best argument is he temporarily limited one way CMS could have tried to pay for insurance companies' losses. The program has two more years to cover its expenses. If any bills are due after that time, CMS or Congress will have to find a way to pay them because they are obligated to do so. Rubio oversimplified a complex process that is still largely unresolved. We rate his statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Fake: Corruption up by 500% in Ukraine Over Past Year, US Aid Not Reaching Targets",
        "doc": "This claim about corruption levels in Ukraine is false. During a March 29 hearing in the US House of Representatives on Ukraine aid transparency and accountability oversight mechanisms, the inspectors general of three US government agencies involved in the delivery and distribution of aid to Ukraine stated that \u201cthere is no evidence that support for Ukraine has been used improperly\u201d. One year after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, international organizations tracking corruption have not recorded an increase in corruption in Ukraine. According to the Transparency International Corruption Index ,\u00a0 Ukraine received 33 points in the 2022 rating, one point higher than 2the previous year. Russian propaganda is spreading disinformation claiming the US is recording \u201ca huge number of facts of corruption and theft\u201d in Ukraine, and the rate of corruption in the country has allegedly increased by 500% compared to last year. Some Russian publications even state that \u201cbecause of the level of corruption\u201d only 20% of American financial aid reaches its designated recipient. This claim is attributed to Republican Congressman from Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee Michael McCaul . \u201c You can\u2019t surprise anyone by the large number of corruption scandals among the Kyiv elite \u2013 in the last year theft has grown by 500%. But sooner or later, everyone\u2019s patience runs out, even in the seemingly generous American trough \u2013 particularly when your own marionettes are sucking up the money \u201d \u2013 Russian propaganda Telegram channels write. In fact, this claim is not true and is completely unfounded, Congressman Michael McCall\u2019s statements were misinterpreted, and others were completely made up. The source of this disinformation was a March 29 Congressional hearing about mechanisms guaranteeing transparency and accountability of US assistance to Ukraine. In his opening remarks, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. McCall stated that \u201conly 20 percent of the funding goes directly to the Ukrainian government in the form of direct budgetary assistance.\u201d It was this sentence that was purposefully distorted by some pro-Russian Telegram channels, which declared that only 20% of financial assistance to Ukraine actually reaches the recipient, and the rest is allegedly stolen by the Ukrainian authorities. What Congressman McCall\u2019s actually said is as follows: \u201c Of the 113 billion dollars appropriated across four supplementals, approximately 60 percent is going to American troops, American workers, and to modernizing American stockpiles. In fact, only 20 percent of the funding is going directly to the Ukrainian government in the form of direct budgetary assistance .\u201d The US aid package includes direct assistance to Ukraine \u2013 economic, military and budgetary assistance to the Ukrainian government; humanitarian aid in Ukraine and countries hosting Ukrainian refugees; and US spending to support global democracy in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s unprovoked attack on Ukraine. These expenditures include compensation to the US Army for the weapons it transfers to Ukraine; support for US troops stationed in Europe; funds for Ukrainian refugees in the United States; funds for nuclear incident fallout management preparation. More details about the different categories of funding are discussed here . But it wasn\u2019t just this statement by McCall that Russian media manipulated and distorted. The allegation that the United States is allegedly recording \u201chuge numbers of corruption and theft\u201d in Ukraine, and that corruption has grown by 500% over the past year, was completely made up and directly contradicts the committee\u2019s conclusions . During the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, inspectors general from the US State and Defense Departments and US Agency for International Development (USAID) were questioned about transparency and accountability mechanisms for US assistance to Ukraine, and they unanimously stated that \u201c there is no evidence that support for Ukraine was misused .\u201d Answering a question posed by Republican Congressman Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, whether the government can guarantee that the money sent to Ukraine is not lost, misused or misspent, US Defense Department Inspector General Robert Storch replied \u201c What I\u2019ve testified to, congressman, is that based on our completed work, we have not substantiated any instances of diversion of U.S. security .\u201d In his opening remarks, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCall stressed that oversight is not about calling the importance of support for Ukraine into question, but about ensuring that aid is \u201cused for its intended purpose.\u201d During a March 29 briefing National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby echoed what the three inspectors general testified \u201c We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there\u2019s been any egregious misconduct when it comes to managing the security assistance that\u2019s gone into Ukraine .\u201d There are no statements by American officials that corruption in Ukraine has increased by 500% over the past year. This information was invented by Russian propagandists. Such an outrageously high growth of corruption in Ukraine during a year of war has not been recorded by any international organizations. According to Transparency International, Ukraine received 33 points in the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2022 , which is the highest score it has received since the launch of the updated Corruption Perceptions Index methodology. Kremlin propaganda outlets regularly spread disinformation about Ukraine to undermine trust between the country\u2019s allies. StopFake has debunked similar disinformation, such as the fake claim that Ukrainian President\u00a0 Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cappropriated 400 million dollars allocated by the United States .\u201d",

According to UFO conspiracy theorists, the sighting occurred on Jan. 20, 2022. The video was shared online with headlines like this one from The Sun tabloid: \u201cBlack Hawk helicopters \u2018filmed chasing tic-tac UFO across sky\u2019 above Connecticut town.\u201d We were unable to locate the original video, and therefore haven\u2019t been able to confirm elements like the date and location the video was taken. The versions we have seen online are also too grainy to determine whether the helicopters are in fact Black Hawk helicopters. However grainy the videos are, though, what can be seen is a spotlight illuminating the ground under the middle aircraft. It seems likely, therefore, that the video shows three helicopters, not two helicopters escorting a UFO. The middle helicopter is using a spotlight to search for something, or someone, on the ground below, and appears particularly bright because the light is facing the camera.",

        "doc": "Job growth in some fields appears to be a bumper crop in the Garden State, but it\u2019s not the kind that appeals to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden).Greenwald said during a Dec. 4 press conference in Trenton that the state needs higher-paying jobs to grow the economy.\"Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality,\" Greenwald said during the press conference to announce a Democrat bills package focusing on job creation and economic development. \"We've added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs.\"Greenwald is correct that Leisure and Hospitality is one of New Jersey\u2019s highest job growth sectors, and that the jobs are considered low-paying. The rest of his statement was erroneous, however.Let\u2019s look at each part of Greenwald\u2019s remarks.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks data in 11 major employment sectors, including Leisure and Hospitality. Jobs in that sector typically include bartenders, servers, food-service workers and other service-oriented jobs.\"Jobs in this sector are often part-time, seasonal, and paid at low hourly rates,\" said Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.Total employment in that sector in New Jersey increased by 5,700 jobs (1.7 percent) from October 2011 to October 2012, according to BLS data.The only sector with higher job growth for the same period was Education and Health Services, at 16,600 jobs (2.7 percent).Next, let\u2019s review salary for both sectors.Leisure and Hospitality jobs in New Jersey had the lowest average salary in 2011, at about $22,329, according to BLS data and Seneca. The average salary in the state that year was $57,546.The numbers are also low when looking at average weekly wages, said Martin Kohli, a chief regional economist for the BLS.For first-quarter 2012, the average weekly wage in New Jersey for workers in Leisure and Hospitality fields was $450, according to a database Koli prepared for us. That\u2019s the lowest salary of the 11 sectors that BLS tracks, Koli said.How did Education and Health Services compare? In New Jersey, the average annual wage in 2011 was $47,338. The weekly salary for first-quarter 2012 was $893.\"The Majority Leader acknowledged that we have created some jobs in New Jersey,\" Brian McGinnis, Greenwald's communications director, said in an e-mail. \"No one is disputing that. He used the example of the Leisure and Hospitality sector to make a larger point. As the data \u2026 show, while this sector has added jobs, they are not for the most part the kind of good-paying middle-class jobs that will help drive a strong economic recovery in New Jersey.\"Now let\u2019s look at the rest of Greenwald\u2019s claim.Greenwald said Leisure and Hospitality has \"the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs.\" That would mean a small number of those workers are earning minimum wage or below, and that\u2019s not accurate. McGinnis acknowledged that Greenwald misspoke.\"The data show the Leisure and Hospitality sector is the industry with the highest proportion of its workers earning minimum wage or below,\" McGinnis said. \" The data further show that about one half of all workers who are paid at or below minimum wage are working in this industry -- primarily in restaurant/food service.\"Our rulingGreenwald said, \"Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality. We've added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs.\"Leisure and Hospitality saw the second-highest rate of job growth in New Jersey in 2011, but a BLS economist confirmed that the average weekly salary of workers for that sector is the lowest among all sectors tracked.Greenwald, however, misstated that those jobs have the lowest proportion of workers earning minimum wage or below.We rate Greenwald\u2019s statement Mostly True.

In the final week of March, articles to that effect were published by news websites including KNTV, WTOL, KUTV, KRON, and WTTG, as well as national outlets like CNN, who reported that: With Covid-19 vaccinations becoming more widespread, you may soon need to carry proof that you\u2019ve been vaccinated to do something like travel or go to a concert.

The offer consisted of a coupon, which could be printed, or a coupon code, both of which could be presented in Office Depot and Office Max stores, and redeemed for one free lamination of a valid COVID-19 vaccination card. No other purchase was necessary, and the offer was scheduled to end on July 25. Many of the articles highlighted above also reported that Staples was running a similar offer. However, despite our repeated attempts to seek clarification about the existence and terms of the offer, Staples did not respond. As a result, we cannot confirm that the news reports\u2019 descriptions of a similar Staples offer were accurate. If we receive clarification from the company, we will update this fact check accordingly.",

        "claim": "Says 97 cents of every dollar played \"represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds.\"",
        "doc": "Every biennium, about a billion dollars flows into the state\u2019s budget by way of the Oregon Lottery. People who play scratchers and video poker are, in a roundabout way, sending some of their cash to schools and parks and other ventures even as they hope to win the big one.But what piece of the overall Lottery revenues does that represent? Well, according to the Lottery website, billboards, TV spots and print ads, it\u2019s about 97 cents on the dollar.Here\u2019s what the Lottery said in a recent print ad that appeared in the June 17, 2012 Oregonian:\"Every time a dollar is played on a Lottery game, think about ninety-seven cents of that dollar helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all. Ninety-seven cents represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds. Ninety-seven cents really adds up.\"We\u2019d seen this same messaging several times before (some variation of the 97-cent ad has been in circulation since October 2010). And so had at least one of our readers who wrote in asking us to take a look at this claim.We called the Oregon Lottery\u2019s spokesman, Chuck Baumann, to see where they got the figures.He pointed us to a lengthy report on the Lottery\u2019s home page that details the operation\u2019s finances for fiscal year 2011. The pertinent table, he said, was on Page 24 and showed that the Lottery had net sales of some $9.8 billion in 2011. Of that cash, about $300 million -- or 3 percent -- went to administrative expenses, which left 97 percent for the state.The thing is, not all of that leftover 97 percent is going to community development. The same chart shows just $523 million going to the economic development fund -- the pot of money that helps schools and parks and other areas of the state. But, as most any math student can tell you, $523 million is not 97 percent of $9.8 billion -- it\u2019s a bit more than 5 percent.The majority of it -- more than $9 billion -- went to \"prizes to the public.\"After looking through the report, we found another breakdown of expenses that seemed to tell a different story altogether. This one, on Page 14, showed the Lottery\u2019s total operating revenue at just over $1 billion. Of that money, $514 million went to operating expenses -- prizes, salaries and wages, game vendor charges, market research, public information, etc.Another $550 million went to the economic development fund -- about 52 percent of the the total operating revenues.We asked Baumann what the difference was between the two tables.The one he showed us, which has nearly $10 billion in revenues, counts something called \"churn,\" he said. See, the state\u2019s biggest source of income (as far as gambling goes) comes in the form of video Lottery. Let\u2019s say you sit down to play and put $20 into the machine. You play the full $20 dollars and you wind up with $10 in winning credits and you play them and lose. Well, that all gets added up in the chart as $30 of revenues -- even though that subsequent $10 never existed as real cash into the system.Conversely, the operating revenues chart that we looked at only represents the initial $20 that you played -- the actual cash into the system.In the end though, it doesn\u2019t really matter which way you look at it, the Lottery\u2019s ads are clearly misleading. The way the ads read, you\u2019d think 97 cents of each dollar goes to \"helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all.\"Now, the Lottery does note that $500 million dollars is returned \"to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds.\" But, however you slice it, that $500 million is not 97 cents of each dollar played.If you look at the big total, which includes the churn, that $500 million is about 5 percent of the Lottery revenues. With the smaller operating revenues budget, it\u2019s a bit over 50 percent.If the Lottery were really returning 97 percent of every dollar played to those programs, the state\u2019s budget problems would be smaller by at least a billion dollars a biennium.The Lottery argues that the prize money going back to players ultimately benefits the state\u2019s economy -- that\u2019s why some earlier ads simply said \"97 cents of every dollar played comes back to Oregon.\" But even those ads mislead by highlighting state services.And what\u2019s more, winnings don\u2019t necessarily stay here. If you win $1 million in the Oregon Lottery, would you spend it all in Oregon?Baumann defended the earlier version but acknowledged that you could \"certainly misconstrue\" the meaning of the ad we\u2019re ruling on.We think it\u2019s more than a matter of misconstruing meaning. For nearly two years, the Oregon Lottery has been running a disingenuous ad campaign that tries to paint playing the Lottery as giving back to schools, parks and other economic development projects. Yes, a piece of the revenue goes there -- but not 97 cents of every dollar played. We think a state agency that deals with money in billions -- and spends nearly $13 million a year on advertising, market research and public information -- should know better.

        "doc": "On the night of March 25, 2021 videos and photographs of a series of fireball lights in the Pacific Northwest night sky gained traction on social media. Some users commenting on the footage claimed the images showed an \u201cUnidentified Flying Object\u201d (UFO), \u201caliens\u201d or a \u201cmeteorite\u201d. Experts said the lightshow was caused by the reentry of the second stage of a Falcon 9, a SpaceX rocket launched on March 4. A video of the event as seen in Portland, Oregon, was captured by KATU News reporter Genevieve Reaume,here. Local outlet King5 published a compilation of footage of the lights seen from the state of Washington,here \u201cSo. this UFO was just seen over Washington and Oregon. WELCOME our new ALIEN OVERLORDS!\u201d, the title of a Facebook post with a TikTok clip reads (here). Other posts (hereandhere), claim their footage showed a meteor or meteorite. On March 26 at 00:18 ET, Jonathan McDowell, astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian (here) identified the object on Twitter (here) as the second stage of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched on March 4, which \u201cfailed to make a deorbit burn and is now reentering after 22 days in orbit.\u201d The National Weather Service in Seattle also said on Twitter in the early morning of March 26 (here) that according to \u201cunofficial information\u201d, the objects in the sky were debris from the SpaceX rocket. In subsequent tweets, the office explained why the objects were not meteors, based on their reentering angle and slower speed (here). The Falcon 9 is a \u201creusable, two stage rocket\u201d (here). A diagram of the separation of the two stages can be seen in an article by USA Today,here. McDowell said the seven-meter-long stage was \u201csupposed to immolate itself over the ocean south of Australia\u201d (here). Contacted by Reuters via email, McDowell explained the orbit of the rocket, which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida (here), was tracked by the US Space Force as \u201cobject 47782\u201d and that its reentry was \u201cpredicted, although the exact time was not known in advance.\u201d \u201cA reentering rocket melts, disintegrates into many lumps which carry on parallel tracks just as observed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt that what people saw was the breakup and reentry of space debris object 47782.\u201d James Davenport, Research Assistant Professor at the Astronomy Department of the University of Washington, also attributed the event to the SpaceX rocketyoutu.be/ekJanB4cjUk?t=45, in an interview with local outlet KING 5 News (NBC Seattle). \u201cIt did exactly what it was supposed to do, it put satellites in orbit. The only failure it had is that it didn\u2019t complete deorbit burn, so it didn\u2019t come down when and where we expected it,\u201d he added. Similar images were seen in Australia in Feb. 2021 when debris from a Chinese rocket burned up as it re-entered the earth\u2019s atmosphere (here), and in May 2020 with the reentry of a Russian rocket late stage (here). \u201cRemember there is a lot of energy in a space rocket launch,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cThat energy was imparted to the stage at launch and now you are getting it all back in a brief time.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.",

        "claim": "\"For decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest-taxed states in the country. I actually did it.\"",
        "doc": "When Tim Pawlenty announced his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he touted his record as a two-term governor of Minnesota.He portrayed himself as a fiscal conservative and said he had been successful at lowering Minnesota\u2019s tax burden.\"For decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest-taxed states in the country,\" Pawlenty said. \"I actually did it.\"To check his claim, we turned to statistics from the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group that has assembled annual studies of state taxes for decades.The foundation tracks tax burden rankings among the 50 states going back to 1977. The foundation combines state and local tax burdens by counting items defined as taxes by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal statistical agency.A ranking of 1 means the heaviest tax burden, while 50 means the lowest.Pawlenty (R)2009: 7th2008: 11th2007: 11th2006: 11th2005: 15th2004: 16th2003: 17thGov. Jesse Ventura (I)2002: 12th2001: 14th2000: 12th1999: 8thGov. Arne Carlson (R)1998: 11th1997: 7th1996: 8th1995: 8th1994: 10th1993: 10th1992: 11th1991: 9thGov. Rudy Perpich (D) (second and third terms)1990: 5th1989: 6th1988: 5th1987: 9th1986: 10th1985: 5th1984: 3rd1983: 5thGov. Al Quie (R)1982: 10th1981: 11th1980: 9th1979: 7thGov. Rudy Perpich (D) (first term)1978: 10th1977: 10th(The 2009 figures are the latest available.)Now let\u2019s take a closer look at four key questions:-- Did Pawlenty keep Minnesota out of the top 10? Largely, yes. Under Pawlenty, Minnesota ranked in the top 10 highest-taxed states for only one of the seven years where data is available. It never ranked lower than 17th, but that\u2019s still enough to make this part of Pawlenty\u2019s claim mostly accurate.-- Was Pawlenty the first governor to push the state out of the top 10? No. Pawlenty did indeed stand firm against tax increases, but his immediate predecessor, third-party Gov. Jesse Ventura, was really the first to cut income and property taxes, said David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn.According to the Tax Foundation data, Minnesota was out of the top 10 for three of the four years Ventura served as governor. Pawlenty largely continued this achievement, and he presided over an even lower ranking for his first three years in office. But Ventura deserves some credit for making it happen initially.\"The major momentum occurred under Ventura,\" Schultz said.-- Did Pawlenty achieve the lower ranking on his own? No. As in other states, Minnesota's tax policies are shaped by negotiations between the governor and the legislature. So any credit, or blame, for tax policy should be shared between the governor and the legislature. The Minnesota Senate was controlled by the Democrats during Pawlenty\u2019s entire term. The Minnesota House was Republican-held for the first four years of Pawlenty\u2019s term and Democratic-held for the final four years.-- Had Minnesota been in the top 10 highest-taxed states for decades? Basically, yes. Prior to Ventura, Minnesota ranked lower than 10th for only three years out of 22, under governors of both parties. And during those three years, Minnesota barely edged out of the top 10, ranking 11th.We should note that an Associated Press fact check came to a different conclusion than we did. The AP wrote that \"Minnesota remains among the 10 worst states in its overall tax climate, according to the Tax Foundation. In its 2011 State Business Tax Climate Index, the anti-tax organization ranks Minnesota 43rd, making it the eighth worst state. The ranking slipped from 41st two years earlier. The index considers corporate, individual, sales, unemployment insurance and property taxes.\"However, we see nothing in Pawlenty\u2019s statement to suggest that he was talking only about business taxes. The data we used encompass a broader variety of taxes. When we asked Richard Morrison, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, to check with his group to see which measurement seemed more appropriate for Pawlenty\u2019s comment, he agreed with us. So we\u2019re sticking with our measurement.So to recap, we conclude that Pawlenty did have an almost perfect record of keeping Minnesota out of the top 10 list for highest-taxed states. And he\u2019s right that three of his predecessors, in both parties, failed to achieve what he did to any significant degree. But when he says that \"for decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest taxed states in the country,\" he ignores that Ventura achieved this in the three years before Pawlenty became governor.

        "doc": "Many people lost their insurance when companies sent them notices canceling their insurance because it did not meet the higher standards of the ACA. According to Associated Press in an article published on Dec. 26, 2013, millions of Americans who bought their own health insurance were informed that their policies would no longer be offered starting in 2014 because they do not meet the higher standards of the federal Affordable Care Act or the Obamacare. The actual number of people who received the notice remains unclear, in part because officials in nearly 20 states said they do not have the information or are not tracking it. Those who did not meet the criteria \"may not offer preventive care without co-payment, for example, or leave out coverage of maternity care, one of the health-care law's 10 essential benefits,\" noted the Washington Post. This was a direct result of the Obamacare as the health-care law required insurance companies to change their plans, and many companies sent notices of cancelation to people on their insurance plan. In Dec. 2013, the Urban Institute included a question in their Health Reform Monitoring Survey of adults ages 18-64. They asked \u201cDid you receive a notice in the past few months from a health insurance company saying that your policy is cancelled or will no longer be offered at the end of 2013?\u201d Of the 522 people polled who were covered by non-group policies, 18.6 percent said yes, their old plan would no longer be offered because it didn\u2019t meet the new coverage standards that went into effect Jan. 1, 2013.",

        "claim": "\"In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily solid Republican district.\"",
        "doc": "Democrat-turned-Republican state Rep. Allan Ritter told reporters last month that the district he represents once was true blue, but it\u2019s now dead red.Ritter was less, uh, poetical at a Dec. 14 Austin press conference confirming his switch, which helped Republicans edge toward the 101-vote Texas House super-majority they\u2019ll have when the 2011 legislative session starts Tuesday.\"In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily Republican district,\" the Nederland resident said of House District 21, which takes in a portion of Beaumont and extends through southwestern Jefferson County. His comment appeared in a Dec. 15 Dallas Morning News article.Did most voters in Ritter\u2019s district shift right in that time?To gauge election returns, we contacted the Texas Legislative Council, which provided results of various general-election races for Ritter\u2019s district from 1994, four years before he first won his seat, through 2008; analyst Clare Dyer told us the council has yet to analyze 2010 results within the district. We also asked Jefferson County for breakdowns of district results.What we found is that Republicans running statewide were strong vote-getters prior to Ritter\u2019s election, a sign the Dems\u2019 grip on the district was already loosening. Still, Democrats continued to win a share of down-ballot races, though that pattern has faded.Also notable: Jefferson County, historically pro-union, pro-Democratic territory, saw numerous down-ballot races in which the GOP offered no nominees. Also, the district\u2019s configuration changed slightly in redistricting after the 2000 census. We scrutinized district results based on boundaries in place at the time of each election.Some particulars:+In November 1994, seven Republicans running statewide carried the district, topped by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison with 61 percent. But seven Democratic statewide hopefuls also prevailed, led by Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock at 65 percent.+In 1998, Ritter drew 53 percent of the district\u2019s vote, while Democratic state Sen. David Bernsen of Beaumont won 61 percent; U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson fared the best of Democrats in races analyzed by the council, gathering 68 percent.No Democrats won statewide office that year, but five nominees carried HD 21 including two judicial choices and Jim Mattox (for attorney general), 54 percent; John Sharp (lieutenant governor), 53 percent; and Paul Hobby (state comptroller), 52 percent.Eight Republican hopefuls including four judicial nominees won the district, topped by Gov. George W. Bush, at 68 percent.According to Jefferson County, a Democrat carried part of HD 21 in 1998 for a county commissioner\u2019s seat, while a Republican seeking another commissioner seat carried a different part. Among HD 21 voters, Republican Jimmy D. \"Skip\" Hulett bested his Democratic opponent for a district court judgeship, though Hulett lost his race over all.+In 2000, Ritter won 57 percent of the district vote, compared to Lampson\u2019s 63 percent. Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison got 66 percent with Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, drawing 62 percent.+In 2002, Ritter romped with 70 percent as Lampson garnered 66 percent in the district. However, every Republican running statewide--with the leading vote-getter being State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, 64 percent--carried the district.From 2004 through 2010, Ritter ran unopposed in November elections as Republicans running for state and federal office enjoyed continued gains:+In 2004, Bush won 63 percent in the district as Democrat Lampson got 59 percent though he lost his seat to a Republican challenger in a district that had been redrawn by the GOP-majority 2003 Legislature.+In 2006, every Republican running statewide carried the district, led by Hutchison, who drew 65 percent. At the bottom of the statewide slate was Perry, who got 45 percent of the district vote versus three major foes. Down-ballot, the Democratic nominees for Jefferson County judge, Ronald Walker, and the 279th state district judgeship, Randy Shelton, drew 52 and 51 percent, respectively.+In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain drew 66 percent of the vote, while Cornyn carried 64 percent, compared to 55 percent statewide for both. In contested statewide races, no Republican carried less than 56 percent of the district vote.+In November 2010, Republicans beat Democrats in the district for three Texas Supreme Court seats, a seat on the state\u2019s highest criminal court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and a spot on the Ninth Court of Appeals. Down ballot, Republican hopefuls for county treasurer and tax assessor-collector trounced their Democratic foes--also prevailing countywide in the historically Democratic bastion.To our queries, partisan consultants Mike Baselice and Ed Martin said the district leans Republican, but Martin, a Democratic strategist, said it hasn't changed as much as Ritter claims.Baselice, a GOP pollster, stressed numbers that he said demonstrate the district shifting 10 percentage points over 10 years. In 1998, the base Republican vote in the district was 47 percent, he said, a figure based on entwining the results of races for lieutenant governor and state comptroller (and ignoring third-party votes). In 2008, the base GOP vote was 57 percent, based on the results in one race for the Texas Supreme Court.In an interview, Ritter told us voter perceptions have swung. \"I can\u2019t say that a Democrat, the right candidate, cannot win in the district... My point is that the overall view and philosophical view and the comfortability of the voters, they are leaning heavy conservative and Republican. I can tell you, just from the reaction we\u2019ve been getting locally that\u2019s overwhelmingly supportive of (my switch), I know this is the right move.\"Finally, Bruce Drury, a retired Lamar University professor of political scientist, cautioned against basing conclusions about the district\u2019s tilt on the latest elections, which were widely viewed as a referendum on national affairs and the Democratic leadership in Washington. Drury said: \"If the Republicans screw up Congress and (the) 2012 (election) becomes a plebiscite on that and (President Barack) Obama appears to be successful, then Allan Ritter could well be in trouble.\"Our sense? Republicans running statewide had an edge in Ritter\u2019s district before his first election and that advantage expanded in subsequent elections as Democrats became less successful. During the 12 years, though, Democrats still pulled off some wins, while a few candidates (like Ritter) managed not to stir up GOP challengers. Whether such free rides will continue is uncertain.Rittter exaggerates how \"solidly Democratic\" his district was; he\u2019s closer to the mark on how Republican it became.

Were that many students turned down? To back her claim, Burke\u2019s campaign pointed us to a July 31, 2014 memo prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for state Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse). We also tracked down a later memo from the agency dated Aug. 19, 2014. Both memos examined Wisconsin Grants, the state-funded program that gives need-based grants to undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time in one of four sectors: UW-System institutions, tech colleges, private and nonprofit schools or tribal colleges. You must be a state resident to receive the money. All told, the state spent about $106 million in 2013-\u201914 on the grants. Though perhaps not as well known as federal financial aid programs, the state program helps a lot of people. At UW schools and tech schools alone, nearly 57,000 students received grants for the 2013-\u201914 year. UW schools receive an allotment, and the tech schools work from a separate pot of money. The average grant for a UW student was $1,775; for tech students, $994. In the tech system, it\u2019s first-come, first-served for the grants. In the UW System, it\u2019s first-come, first-served until each campus\u2019 allocation is spent. In the 2013-\u201914 year, more than 41,000 financial aid applicants who were eligible for state help did not get any due to lack of funds, according to the Fiscal Bureau memo. More than nine out of 10 of those rejected were tech-school applicants, the memo said. The Fiscal Bureau figures are on target, according to John Reinemann, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board, which administers the grants, and Conor Smyth, director of Strategic Partnerships and External Relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. Those who did not get a grant are put on a list in case they are still in school if grant money becomes available. Demand started to exceed supply of grant money during the Great Recession, when more people were returning to school for retraining and diminished incomes meant many more were eligible to receive aid. The \"unmet need\" reached as high as 80,000 in 2009, statistics show. The tech schools alone saw 54,000 applicants get turned down in 2012. A word about the numbers There\u2019s somewhat less than meets the eye with the waiting list figures, however. There\u2019s some potential -- though apparently relatively minor -- overlap between the UW System and the Wisconsin Technical College System figures. The tech schools put you on a waiting list if you are eligible for one of their awards, and you listed a tech school as the number one choice on your financial aid application. The Fiscal Bureau points out it\u2019s not known how many of those applicants actually enroll at a tech school. They might have enrolled in a UW or private college instead -- and might even have secured a grant from one of those institutions. And while some may have done so because they didn\u2019t get a tech-school grant, others went a different route for other reasons. This situation means the tech school list likely overstates the unmet need to some extent, Fiscal Bureau analyst Emily Pope wrote. Conversely, the UW list -- which includes only students who actually enrolled in a UW school -- likely understates it because it doesn\u2019t include applicants who may have enrolled there if they had received a UW grant, So for all those reasons, the 41,000 waitlist figure is the best we have, but not rock solid. Our rating Burke said: \"We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities,\" most of them for tech schools. There is a large waiting list, and Burke cites a credible source on its size. But some variations in how the lists are defined by the different institutions mean the number should be treated with some caution. We rate her claim Mostly True.",

        "doc": "Recent news reports have discussed the possibility of violence and unrest following the results of the upcoming presidential election, but there\u2019s no evidence that a flyer circulating on social media is associated with antifa activists. \"Election Day nears Comrades!!!\" reads the description a a flyer posted on the Facebook. \"Prepare to defend your rights!!\" The flyer itself says: \"Antifa comrades! On Nov. 4, don\u2019t forget to disguise yourselves as patriots/Trump supporters: wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias, a convincing police uniform is even better! This way police and patriots responding to us won\u2019t know who their enemies are and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it\u2019s hard to turn popular opinion against us!\" An image of this Facebook post is now being shared on the social media platform. But the flyer that appears in the post has been online since at least 2017, when online rumors claimed that antifa activists were planning a revolution that would begin on Nov. 4. This image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Antifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" It\u2019s a broad, loose coalition of left-wing activists including communists, socialists and anarchists who protest white supremacy and other far-right causes. Sometimes antifa activists are violent, but experts say that most of the activity that happens under the antifa banner is nonviolent. The image that\u2019s being shared online appears to be a picture of a Facebook post sharing the flyer in a Facebook group called \"Hickman County Antifa.\" The user who originally posted it there, Katy Krasnow, has told fact-checkers that she shared it as a joke. \"Hickman County Antifa was a satire page,\" she told Snopes. \"I deleted soon after it got shared because it made a lot of people freak out more than I expected. Nobody in the group was really actually connected. We were just sharing dumb antifa memes.\" On Sept. 4, Law Enforcement Today, which \"unapologetically supports those who hold the Thin Blue Line,\" published a story about the flyer being shared on Facebook. \"While I personally loathe the likes of Antifa and their tactics,\" the author wrote, \"I can assure you that this is simply a hoax.\" In 2017, Will Sommer, a politics reporter for the Daily Beast who covers conservative media, described the flyer in a Medium post as one of several \"fabricated \u2018planning documents\u2019 that urge antifa guerillas to commit violence while posing as police or Trump supporters.\" In June, a Twitter account \u2014@ANTIFA_US \u2014 appeared to call for violence, rallying \"comrades\" to move into residential areas and \"take what\u2019s ours.\" But the account wasn\u2019t actually affiliated with antifa activists; rather, it was created by a known white supremacist group, according to Twitter.

        "claim": "\"Middle-class families throughout America (would) have to pay $6,000 per year\" to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.",
        "doc": "In the three-way race for the U.S. Senate in Florida, both Republican Marco Rubio and independent candidate Charlie Crist favor extending the current tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. Democrat Kendrick Meek, on the other hand, favors President Barack Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.After Rubio defended the tax cuts, Meek made the case that raising taxes on the wealthy reduces government debt, and that actually helps the middle class.\"Middle-class families throughout America have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for the tax cut that he's talking about,\" Meek said. \"That's before the finance charge from China, Japan, or India. I think it's important that we look at leveling with the people of this state, not just the cake-and-ice-cream, deregulation, everyone-should-get-a-tax-cut kind of way. If we are going to govern, we must govern in a responsible way, because we are putting our children in a position that no other nation's children will be in as it relates to paying back this debt.\"We were interested in fact-checking Meek's statement that \"Middle-class families throughout America have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for\" tax cuts for the wealthy.A little background about tax cuts: In 2001, President George W. Bush promoted tax cuts as a way to return money to citizens because the federal government was running a surplus. In 2003, Bush promoted the extension of some of those tax cuts as a necessary economic stimulus after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. But Bush lacked the votes in Congress to permanently change the tax code, so the laws that passed stipulated that the new, lower tax rates would expire in 2010. That means the rates for everyone will automatically go up in 2011 unless Congress takes action.President Obama campaigned on a platform to renew tax cuts for the middle class and to let tax cuts expire for individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples who make more than $250,000. Meek, currently a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, supports that plan. The Obama administration has released detailed budget estimates showing that higher tax rates on the wealthy will generate $678.3 billion over 10 years.Obama's proposal raises the income rates on the top brackets from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent. But he also proposes a few other provisions affecting high earners, such as increasing their dividends taxes and capping tax exemptions. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center crunched the numbers on the proposals in Obama's 2011 budget and found the following: Getting back to Meek's statement, Meek said that tax cuts for the wealthy would \"cost\" middle-class taxpayers $6,000 each. We should note that keeping the lower tax rates in place doesn't technically \"cost\" the government anything. Rather, it's money that the government doesn't collect. Given the current fiscal imbalances, though, any reduction in tax revenues without cutting spending puts the country more into debt.Meek said he wasn't counting interest on the debt, and that it would cost middle-class taxpayers $6,000 per year. We know that over 10 years, the tax increase for the wealthy totals $678.3 billion, so $6,000 per taxpayer per year means there are ... (hold on a minute, we're punching the numbers into our calculator) ... 11.3 million middle-class taxpayers -- a laughably small number.There are about 157 million taxpayers in total, so using this math, Meek's middle class would be disturbingly small -- less than 10 percent of all taxpayers. Democrats like to say that the middle class is shrinking, but we don't think even Meek would suggest it's less than 10 percent. We suspected Meek meant $6,000 per family over 10 years.And in fact, when we ran our analysis by the Meek campaign, they admitted he misspoke, that he meant to say over 10 years. They used a 2007 Census estimate of 116 million households in the United States.In rating our item, we should note that some Republicans object to saying that tax cuts \"cost\" anything. It's not spending, they say, it's money that belongs to the people. Still, if the country is deficit-spending, it's foregone revenue that will have to be made up for some way. But this philosophical debate is a side note to our fact check because Meek said the tax cuts for the wealthy would cost middle-class families \"$6,000 per year.\" That number is way off, by at least a factor of 10. Meek's campaign admitted he flubbed it. We rate Meek's statement False.",

        "claim": "Paul Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan \"could raise future retirees\u2019 costs more than $6,000.\"",
        "doc": "Editor\u2019s note: After we originally published this item, we received several emails questioning our ruling and pointing us to a new study on the Medicare Advantage program. We reviewed that evidence, considered the arguments of those who disagreed with us and reconsidered our original rating of Mostly True. (Read the archived original version.) Here, we\u2019ve incorporated the new evidence into our original story and issued a new rating of Half True.In the latest salvo in a growing battle over Medicare, President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign has released an ad that criticizes the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket over Ryan\u2019s plan for Medicare.The ad, called \"Facts,\" touts support for his own approach to Medicare from the AARP -- the organization representing older Americans -- as well as AARP\u2019s criticism of Ryan\u2019s proposal. (After the ad\u2019s release, AARP issued a statement to clarify that it was not involved in the making of the ad, though the statement didn\u2019t dispute the ad\u2019s use of AARP\u2019s previous written comments.)At one point, the narrator says that \"experts say (Ryan\u2019s) voucher plan could raise future retirees\u2019 costs more than $6,000.\" An on-screen visual adds the text, \"Raise seniors\u2019 costs by $6,400 a year. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 4/8/11.\"Is this accurate? Only partly so. We\u2019ll take a look at why.The Romney-Ryan Medicare planAs we\u2019ve noted, Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums.This would have affected people who today are under 55 only, but critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost.The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and harmful to beneficiaries. Subsequently, Ryan offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. Ryan\u2019s most recent plan is similar to his original one, with two key differences. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market -- the price of the second-cheapest plan.So is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? It appears to be. In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, \"Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical.\"This history is important because of how the Obama campaign frames the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in the ad.The $6,400 questionThe ad documents its claim of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs by citing a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here\u2019s what the group said:\"In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare,\" center president Bob Greenstein wrote. \"CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double \u2014 from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater.The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400.In an interview, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that the numbers his group used come from CBO, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and that the center\u2019s role was just to take the CBO analysis and make it \"more understandable.\"In fact, different groups have made slightly different calculations of the out-of-pocket increase -- the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, tabulated the number to be $6,870 -- but the estimates we\u2019ve seen are all in the same ballpark.But here\u2019s the problem: The CBO analysis, and the other groups\u2019 analyses that were built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase, while still keeping spending lower than current projections. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn\u2019t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange.That means while the traditional Medicare offering \u2014 if it\u2019s more expensive than the second-least expensive plan \u2014 could cost seniors more out-of-pocket, it\u2019s unlikely to cost them as much as estimates for Ryan\u2019s earlier plan.Of course, it\u2019s still not clear what would happen over time if those market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan\u2019s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else?\"CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed,\" CBO wrote earlier this year.The Obama campaign said it would be happy to update its numbers if CBO or the Romney-Ryan campaign provided new data, but neither has. Peter Orszag, Obama\u2019s former Office of Management and Budget director, recently wrote that \"if Ryan believes that changes to his plan since (the original plan was released) would result in any different conclusions, he should request that CBO publish an updated analysis.\"But there is one clue that the number wouldn\u2019t be close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan\u2019s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare.That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month \u2014 which adds up to less than $800 a year.But the absence of data means that analyzing the impact of the new Ryan plan is speculative. Van de Water told PolitiFact that, in the absence of specifics, \"I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on what a new CBO estimate would show. ... Since Ryan has advanced many different versions of premium support, one should specify which version one is talking about.\"But despite such concerns, Van de Water did say that the Obama campaign\u2019s decision to use the old numbers was defensible. \"It also seems reasonable to cite the most recent available analysis\" when Ryan has not provided enough detail to do a new one.Our ratingThe Obama ad would have been more accurate if it had specified that it was referring to a previous Ryan plan for Medicare rather than the current one. We simply don\u2019t have enough details to know how much extra money seniors might have to pay under the current Ryan plan. Still, the Obama campaign gave itself some wiggle room by saying that the plan \"could\" raise out-of-pocket costs by more than $6,000. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",

        "claim": "\"One in 19 Americans today get SSDI or SSI. That's one in 19 Americans (who) are disabled.\"",
        "doc": "At a Dec. 1, 2010, meeting of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- the Simpson-Bowles commission that was tasked with finding a solution for soaring deficits -- one of the panel's members, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., cited disability payments as an example how government spending has gotten \"out of control.\"\"We've created dependency,\" Coburn said. \"And one great example is one in 19 Americans today get SSDI or SSI. That's one in 19 Americans (who) are disabled, and when the law says you're only disabled if there's no job in the economy you can perform, and we don't address that issue in this plan.\"We won't take sides on the question of whether SSDI and SSI should be cut or modified -- as Coburn and other critics have suggested, citing both cost and allegations of fraud by applicants -- but we were intrigued by the idea that more than 5 percent of Americans receive payments from one program or the other. We'd bet that most Americans who don't receive SSDI or SSI benefits are only dimly aware of these programs. Yet, if Coburn is right, these programs cover more than the percentage of Americans who are of Asian-American heritage (4.5 percent), more than double the number of American Jews (approximately 2 percent) and five times the number of American Indians (1 percent). So we decided to see if Coburn was right.First, some background on the two programs, both of which are run by the Social Security Administration.Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is funded by Social Security taxes paid by workers, employers and the self-employed. To be eligible for SSDI, a worker must have earned sufficient credits as a worker paying into the Social Security system. Typically, a worker will receive disability benefits if he or she becomes blind or disabled, or if a now-deceased spouse earned SSDI. Payments are based on the insured worker's Social Security earnings record. The program is set to pay out almost $124 billion in benefits this year.By contrast, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is financed through general revenues rather than by taxes specifically paid into the Social Security system. SSI disability benefits are payable to adults or children who are disabled or blind, have limited income and resources and meet certain requirements on living arrangements. The monthly payment varies up to the maximum federal benefit rate, and it may be supplemented by state payments or decreased by other income. The federal government appropriated almost $46 billion for its share of benefits this year.Supporters say the programs provide needed support to the most vulnerable members of American society. But the programs have their share of critics, many of whom point to the steady increase in the programs' cost and the risk of abuse by people who are not truly too disabled to work.For purposes of consistency, we looked at the 2009 annual reports for each program, because both offered statistics for the same month -- December 2009.For that month, SSDI benefits were paid to 8.9 million recipients. SSI paid benefits that same month to 7.7 million people. Combined, that works out to 16.6 million people receiving benefits from one of the two programs in December 2009.If you divide that figure by the total United States population in 2009 of 307 million people, it works out to be 5.4 percent, or just slightly more than one out of every 19 Americans.But before we declare Coburn completely correct, let's look at how many people collect both SSDI and SSI. We couldn't find those numbers for December 2009, but for November 2010, the overlap was about 1.8 million people. If you assume that the number was roughly similar for December 2009, then 4.8 percent of the U.S. population receives either SSDI or SSI -- or one out of every 20.7 people.That makes Coburn very close, so we rate his statement Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Says he has a plan for \"$1 billion in tax relief for Illinois.\"",
        "doc": "The day after unveiling a new budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year, Gov. Bruce Rauner followed that up with a televised campaign ad that portrays the re-election seeking incumbent as \"leading the charge\" to cut taxes for working people in Illinois. The Rauner ad takes aim at Democratic House Speaker Mike Madigan, the governor\u2019s frequent nemesis, who gets blamed for imposing a $5 billion tax increase last summer over Rauner\u2019s objection. At 14 seconds, the spot says: \"Bruce Rauner vetoed the Madigan income tax increase, and now Rauner\u2019s leading the charge to reverse it. The Rauner plan: More take-home pay for working families, lower taxes for job creators and $1 billion in tax relief for Illinois.\" Rauner didn\u2019t actually include that tax cut in his spending plan, which ironically relies on the revenue bump from the very tax increase he assails. But he did argue in his speech to lawmakers that an overhaul to state pensions could be used to fund a \"nearly $1 billion tax cut.\" Though Rauner rounded up, the value of the proposed tax cut is noted in the governor\u2019s budget book as $917 million. At the same time, however, the Rauner budget did anticipate separate cost saving initiatives which, if realized, would over several years shift responsibility for more than $1 billion in expenses for teacher pensions off the state books and on to local property taxpayers. Given all that, can Rauner really lay claim as he does in his ad to having a plan for $1 billion in tax relief? We decided to take a look. Rauner\u2019s previous budgets have been laden with fiscal gimmicks, leading PolitiFact to twice award the governor its lowest Pants-on-Fire! credibility rating for claiming they were balanced. His latest offering appears constructed with more care. Not present, for example, was the major asterisk he slipped into his 2017 budget which attributed more than $4 billion in savings to a legislative compromise that had not been hammered out and never was. That said, the latest budget offering and tax-cut plan from Rauner has its share of difficult-to-achieve contingencies and faces challenges both in the Legislature and likely the courts as well. First, Rauner would need the Legislature to pass a pension-reform bill that upends the current formula for calculating future benefits. The governor didn\u2019t put forward a specific proposal but he said the idea is based on a model that makes employees choose between annual salary increases and cost of living increases to pension benefits. What\u2019s more, just months after Rauner took office in 2015 the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously struck down a sweeping pension reform plan approved two years earlier. The court found that the state Constitution says retirement benefits, once offered to public workers, can not be \"diminished or impaired.\" At the same time, however, the court hinted that it might be possible to change the structure of pension benefits as long as employees got something of equal value in return. The concept has never been legally tested. So even if lawmakers and the governor agreed on a pension-reform fix, it almost certainly would face a court challenge with an uncertain outcome. The idea that the very difficult pension reform would be ironed out in the coming months leaves critics skeptical of Rauner\u2019s plan. On top of that, the governor would have to convince the Democratic-controlled Legislature to then partly reverse the income tax increase it passed, with some Republican votes, last year. \"It needs legislative approval on the front end and back end and a Constitutional review in the middle \u2014 other than that it\u2019s golden,\" said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. Rauner\u2019s campaign staff did not respond to questions from the BGA about the governor\u2019s tax cut claim. Also left hanging were questions about the pension spending shift which over time could force local schools to seek significant property tax hikes. Separately, the governor\u2019s office did issue this statement: \"We don\u2019t need pension reform to balance the budget, but if we can take that extra step we can put nearly $1 billion back in taxpayers\u2019 pockets and begin to roll back the tax hike with a 1.4 percent tax rate cut. We look forward to working together with legislators on both sides of the aisle to pass these vital reforms and get Illinois moving in the right direction.\" Rauner says he has a plan for \"$1 billion in tax relief for Illinois\" tied to a pension overhaul. But that statement is suspect on multiple levels \u2014even for a campaign commercial. There is no actual plan to examine. The \"plan\" consists of brief mentions in a more than 550-page budget proposal and a few lines in a speech, but no details were provided to explain how the savings would be implemented or calculated. However, the tax cut was then featured prominently in a re-election campaign ad the day after Rauner unveiled his budget. What\u2019s more, Rauner\u2019s budget does include separate provisions to shift teacher pension costs off the state books and on to local school districts where property taxpayers would likely have to collectively pick up a tab costing more than $1 billion. Rauner\u2019s ad highlights a vague $1 billion tax cut plan, but makes no mention of the added expense to local taxpayers that would be the practical effect of his pension cost shift. His tax cut claim should not be considered in a vacuum, which is why we rate it Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Barack Obama \"wants to nearly double the capital gains tax\" increasing taxes on \"mutual funds, 401(k)s\" for \"policemen, firemen, nurses.\"",
        "doc": "Republican nominee Sen. John McCain criticized Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama for proposing a tax increase on capital gains. \"Senator Obama says that he doesn't want to raise taxes on anybody making over $200,000 a year, yet he wants to nearly double the capital gains tax. Nearly double it, which 100-million Americans have investments in \u2014 mutual funds, 401(k)s \u2014 policemen, firemen, nurses. He wants to increase their taxes,\" McCain told interviewer George Stephanopoulos of ABC'sThis Weekon April 20, 2008. McCain is right about Obama's position on capital gains taxes. Obama has proposed raising them to between 20 and 28 percent to help pay for other programs. That top rate would \"nearly double them.\" He's also right that many Americans hold mutual funds and 401(k)s. About 96-million hold mutual funds, according to industry estimates, with about 84 percent holding mutual funds in 401(k)s and other defined contribution retirement plan accounts. But McCain strays from the path when he describes what capital gains taxes will affect and who will pay them. Let's stop here and explain exactly what a capital gains tax is. The Internal Revenue Service explains: \"Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset.\" When you sell an asset for a profit, that profit margin is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the income level of the tax filer and the length of the investment, with separate tax rates for short-term vs. long-term capital gains. People who want low capital gains taxes say they should be low because they encourage investment and economic growth. People who sell stocks for a profit, for example, are often concerned about capital gains taxes. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush cut the capital gains tax rate, so people now pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than they do on their regular income. The long-term capital gains tax rate for higher income brackets now is 15 percent, considerably lower than their marginal income tax rates. (If you're making more than $32,000 a year, your income tax rates range from 25 percent to 35 percent. See adetailed income tax chart here.) But McCain's assertion about whom capital gains taxes would affect is another story. He says they would affect \"mutual funds and 401(k)s.\" He's right on mutual funds, but not about 401(k) or mutual funds held under a 401(k) retirement plan. A 401(k) is a retirement account to which workers can contribute earnings without paying taxes on the earnings. People aren't taxed on their 401(k) accounts until they withdraw the money. When they do withdraw that money, it's subject to regular income taxes, not capital gains taxes. We asked McCain's campaign about his comments; a spokesman said increases to the capital gains tax would depress the stock market and thereby hurt people's 401(k)s. The idea is that investors would avoid the stock market because they have to pay a higher tax on their profits, stocks would go down, and then the value of 401(k)s would drop. But economists disagree about whether captial gains taxes have a significant effect on the stock market, and McCain's comments don't make it clear that he's talking about an indirect effect. McCain's comments imply that 100-million people would see higher tax bills due to capital gains increases. This significantly inflates the number of people who pay capital gains taxes, even at the lower rate. Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., pointed us to IRS data that show about 16.2-million taxpayers were subject to capital gains taxes in 2005, the most recent year for which data are available. Additionally, most of the gains reported in 2005 \u2014 about 81 percent \u2014 were claimed by taxpayers making $200,000 a year or more, the top 2.7 percent of tax returns. We don't think of them as \"policemen, firemen, nurses.\" So McCain is right on Obama's position, but he takes a lot of liberties in explaining the potential effects of an increase in the capital gains tax rate. Capital gains tax increases would not directly affect most working people saving for retirement. We find his statement to be Half True. ",

        "claim": "Creflo Dollar needed a $65 million Gulfstream G650 to carry thousands of pounds of food and other supplies -- as well as the Word of God -- worldwide.",
        "doc": "Pastor Creflo Dollar\u2019s plan to travel the world in the fastest and most luxurious business jet ever built never got off the ground. He and other leaders at World Changers Church International in College Park launched Project G650 with the goal of raising nearly $65 million for the airplane, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful. But negative public reaction to Dollar\u2019s fundraising plea was so swift that it was halted within days of its launch. A promotional video featuring Dollar was quickly pulled down, but lives via YouTube. Some of the harshest words came from the faith community, including contemporary gospel\u2019s Kirk Franklin who said: \"When I camouflage my \u2018greeds\u2019 to look like \u2018needs,\u2019 that\u2019s a shortage of character.\" Others asked: Why couldn\u2019t pastor and evangelist Dollar conduct his mission travels as most do, via commercial airline, rather than a Gulfstream G650? We tried to reach Dollar directly but were referred to Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president at 5W Public Relations in New York. He is representing Creflo Dollar Ministries and has been fielding questions about the now-defunct fundraising campaign. In an article that appeared March 13, Engelmayer told The Christian Post that Dollar is now taking commercial flights when he visits churches in New York. But, \"it\u2019s not that simple,\" Engelmayer said, when a ministry team of 10 to 15 people \"take thousands of pounds,\" even 100,000 pounds, \"of food and provisions with them when they go around the world.\" That\u2019s why the Gulfstream G650 is needed, he suggested. \"The plane is not so Creflo Dollar can get on by himself and fly.\" Engelmayer made similar comments to the Associated Press. He said members of the ministry travel much of the year bringing their message, food and supplies to people around the world, and this jet has the fuel efficiency, speed, cargo space and seating the church needed. So is that a reason the ministry wanted donations of $65 million -- to have an airplane with cargo space capable of carrying thousands, possibly 100,00 pounds of food and other supplies? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts. First a little background about the 53-year-old megachurch pastor and evangelist and how he came to say he was praying for a Gulfstream G650. Dollar preaches what is known as the prosperity gospel, a religious doctrine that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. A native of College Park, he founded the non-denominational World Changers Church International, which boasts 30,000 members, 350 employees, an 81-acre campus and mission work on six continents. Dollar has long been criticized for being a preacher who lives a lavish lifestyle with Rolls Royces, million-dollar homes and jets. The tax exempt status of his ministry -- as well as five others -- was the focus of a U.S. Senate committee\u2019s three-plus year investigation that started in 2007 and was based on public complaints and media reports about large salaries, lavish expenditures. Dollar protested the investigation, which closed with no findings of wrongdoing. Committee investigators said Dollar and the ministry at that time had four airplanes, including the one he wanted to replace with the $65 million Gulfstream. The plane World Changers and Dollar made the case for the new jet -- the Gulfstream G650, which is manufactured in Savannah -- after the church\u2019s longtime Gulfstream G1159A, more commonly known as a G-III, was damaged and taken out of service last last year. They said the jet -- built in 1984 and purchased in 1999 -- traveled four million miles and had two recent mishaps: one where the right engine failed near Hawaii enroute to Australia; and a second in which the airplane\u2019s nose hit a London runway while Dollar\u2019s wife, Taffi, and three of his daughters were aboard. It was after these incidents, Dollar told potential donors on the video, \"I knew it was time to begin to believe God for a new airplane.\" PolitiFact found a National Transportation Safety Board report confirming that older jet received \"substantial airframe damage\" in the accident that occurred on takeoff from London to Canada. Eight people were on the airplane, including one woman who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia confirmed that the jet likely would need to be replaced if it had substantial airframe damage. But Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group in Washington, said Dollar -- in proposing that the disabled jet be replaced with a $65 million G650 -- was suggesting going from \"the old Honda to the new Rolls Royce.\" This 18-seat jet, which won aviation\u2019s most prestigious honor, the Collier Trophy in 2014, is considered the best and fastest high-end corporate jet ever built. It\u2019s the mode of travel for world governments, the very top echelon of business executives and likely the richest of the rich, he said. Does it have cargo space for thousands of pounds of food and other supplies? Experts told us the answer is no. Carrying cargo is not this jet\u2019s mission, Aboulafia said. \"If they make that claim [that they were buying the Gulfstream G650 to carry cargo], they're expecting the public to be a lot dumber than it is,\" he said. Cargo space on a business jet is measured in terms of golf bags, Aboulafia said. Steve Cass, vice president for technical marketing and communications with the jet\u2019s manufacturer, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., confirmed the jet\u2019s space limitations. The G650 has room for 18 passengers and 2,500 pounds of baggage, Cass said. We sent an email to Engelmayer asking him to clarify his \"cargo\u2019 comments. He did not respond specifically to that request, but said there is \"no campaign for a plane, and the ministry\u2019s work helping people in need and spreading the gospel continues as it always has. \"There is nothing more about this to discuss,\" he said. Rusty Leonard, founder and CEO of MinistryWatch.com said he was \u2018disturbed, but not surprised\" to learn Dollar was trying to raise money for a $65 million jet. \"This is normal behavior for a prosperity gospel preacher who turns the gospel upside down by making it all about your/their own blessings/success rather than about sacrificially blessing others who are in need as Jesus actually taught,\" he said. His organization does not recommend donating to Dollar\u2019s organizations, Leonard said. Our ruling: Dollar and other leaders in World Changers Church International launched and then dropped a campaign that asked followers to pony up $65 million for a top-of-the-line luxury jet. It\u2019s an airplane generally reserved for world leaders, the top crop of business executives and billionaires. One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods -- as well as ministers bringing the Word of God -- to other parts of the world. That argument never got off the runway. It is inaccurate and bordering on ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. ",

        "claim": "\"We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year.\"",
        "doc": "During an appearance on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" on the Fox Business Network last month, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the current crisis at the border is at a level he has \"never seen before.\" Patrick\u2019s segment appeared after one about the birth rate from 2017, when more than 3.8 million births were recorded across the country, the lowest number in 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"This will stagger you,\" Patrick said, referencing Dobbs\u2019 report on birth rates. \"We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year.\" \"We\u2019re on pace to apprehend a million people crossing into this country illegally. Any law enforcement person you talk to \u2014 local sheriff, our state police \u2014 they will tell you that they catch one out of four or five. That means if we catch 1 million, there are 4 million others.\" Patrick\u2019s claim is wrong. No matter how generously we slice and dice the figures, his math does not add up. Patrick under on apprehension estimate Alejandro Garcia, spokesman for Patrick, pointed us to a few different sources for this claim: news reports about birth rates, projected border apprehensions for the coming year and a study that suggested the population of people in the country illegally is significantly higher than previously recorded. Let\u2019s start with projected border apprehensions. The ABC News article Garcia provided reports that border authorities are \"predicting the number of undocumented migrants stopped at the southern border could reach as high as 1 million by the end of the year, potentially doubling last year\u2019s level.\" The only problem here, as the article notes, is that this estimate \"includes illegal crossings and people arriving at ports of entry.\" Similar claims have been made by federal officials in the past, with the same caveat, that their estimate counts both apprehensions of individuals crossing illegally and law enforcement encounters with individuals at ports of entry who are looking to enter the country legally. A Fact-check.org analysis found that a more accurate estimate is that federal authorities are on track to make 643,306 apprehensions this fiscal year, the time frame U.S. Customs and Border Protection looks at when tracking apprehensions. That number was based on average apprehensions from the first five months of the fiscal year, which spans from October to September. There are two more months of data available now, which has boosted the monthly average. Officials are now on track to make about 789,000 apprehensions this fiscal year. It\u2019s also possible to come up with a similar estimate for the calendar year; Patrick didn\u2019t specify which period he was considering. Given the monthly average of about 76,700 apprehensions for the first four months of the year, officials look to be on track to make about 920,400 apprehensions this calendar year. Patrick wrong on 1 out of 4 (or 5) claim Garcia pointed to a study published by researchers at the Yale University School of Management to support the last part of Patrick\u2019s claim: that agents apprehend just one in every four or five individuals who attempt to enter the country illegally. The study looked to calculate how many undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and it found a mean population estimate of 22.1 million in 2016 \u2014 \"essentially double the current widely accepted estimate\" of 11.3 million. But Edward Kaplan, a professor at Yale University who authored the study, said the higher population count does not mean individuals are crossing the border at the rate Patrick suggested. \"We do not estimate that 5 million people have crossed the border illegally in any single year during the time of our study,\" Kaplan said in an email, noting that the highest number of border crossings reported in the study was in 2000, when an estimated 2.6 million people crossed illegally. An important aside here: Many experts have raised concerns about the validity of the Yale study, including researchers at the Migration Policy Institute who said its findings were based on \"seriously flawed assumptions\" about migration patterns and Census data. Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, was among those researchers who criticized the results. He called its conclusions \"unsupportable\" in a blog post for the center, which advocates for low levels of immigration. We asked Camarota to take a look at Patrick\u2019s claim. Even though there has been an increase in apprehensions from previous years, Camarota said, far fewer than 4 million people will cross the border illegally this year. He said even if Patrick\u2019s claim was limited just to births of native-born Americans (which Camarota estimated to be at about 3.1 million in 2017) or if he included estimates for people who overstay their visas in his calculation of illegally crossings, the ratio is off. \"The bottom line is that it doesn\u2019t seem possible you could get to 4 million,\" Camarota said, referencing the number of births recorded in 2017. The Department of Homeland Security offers estimates for apprehension rates at the border and for how many people successfully enter the country illegally, based in part on observable data reported by agents on the ground and on statistical models. A Border Security Metrics report published in February used two different calculations to estimate that agents at the southern border apprehended about 65% to 75% of people who attempted to enter the country illegally in fiscal year 2017. A separate report published by the Office of Immigration Statistics in 2017 said agents apprehend 55% to 85% of all individuals attempting to cross, depending on the specific estimate. The DHS report also includes estimates for \"got aways,\" people who were observed successfully crossing the border while evading apprehension, and \"total successful unlawful entries,\" a number calculated through statistical models and observable data. There were an estimated 104,000 \"got aways\" in 2017 (an 83% decrease from 615,000 in 2006) and 160,000 \"total successful unlawful entries\" in 2017 (a 92% decrease from 2.1 million in 2000). Our ruling Patrick said, \"We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year.\" There is no evidence to support Patrick\u2019s claim. While it is hard to say exactly how many people successfully enter the country illegally while evading detection, it\u2019s safe to say that the real number is significantly smaller than Patrick\u2019s 5 million. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Footnote: This isn\u2019t the first time Patrick has made a claim like this. In 2014, he suggested that more people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week \"than are born in Texas each week.\" That was True (at the time).",

        "claim": "Says his book,The Art of the Deal,is \"the No. 1 selling business book of all time.\"",
        "doc": "Appearing on CNN to defend his controversial comments on \"rapist immigrants,\" Donald Trump said he doesn\u2019t understand why Republican party leaders are so quick to publicly dismiss him. After all, Trump reasoned, he\u2019s surging in the polls and has had a track record of success: He attended one of the best business schools in America, created a hotel and entertainment empire, and is a bestselling author to boot. \"They like to say, well, we don't consider him a serious candidate. Why wouldn't I be?,\" Trump said on July 1. \"I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a great student. ... I go out, I make a tremendous fortune. I write a book called The Art of the Deal, the No. 1 selling business book of all time, at least I think, but I\u2019m pretty sure it is. And certainly a big monster, the No. 1 bestseller. I do The Apprentice, a tremendous success, one of the most successful shows.\" We were curious about Trump\u2019s literary credentials. Did he pen the top-selling business book of all time? The Art of the Deal, a memoir that offers readers 11 steps for business success, was a smash when first published in November 1987. Trump hosted a celebrity-filled launch party, landed on the covers of magazines and toured the late night talk show circuit to promote and discuss the book. \"The momentum around the book was tremendous,\" wrote journalist Timothy L. O\u2019Brien in a biography of the mogul. \"The voice that sprang from the pages was entirely original, seemingly candid, relentlessly boastful and refreshingly unafraid to take swipes, settle scores, and opine with an I-am-what-I-am gusto. The Art of the Deal was a tour of the business world according to Mister Id, and readers ate it up.\" It spent 51 weeks on theNew York Times' bestseller list and, according to some reports, sold 1 million copies. Neither the Trump campaign nor the book\u2019s publisher got back to us, so we were unable to verify this figure. Instead, we looked at data from Nielsen Bookscan. The data isn't perfect. For one, it counts sales only since 2001. And for another, it onlytallies the number of print copies sold by major booksellers (about 85 percent of the market). According to Nielsen data, The Art of the Deal has sold about 177,000 copies in all its editions: Published Binding type Publisher Sales since 2001 Nov. 1, 1987 Hardcover Random House 17,000 Jan. 1, 1989 Mass market paperback Random House 90,000 Dec. 1, 2004 Mass market paperback Hachette Book Group 70,000 It\u2019s difficult to weigh Trump\u2019s opus against other \"business books\" for two reasons. One, best-seller lists are almost always periodical. Amazon tallies sales by the hour, while the New York Times\u2019 lists are by week or by month. Greg Cowles, who writes for the New York Times \"Inside the List\" column, says the paper doesn\u2019t track all-time sales. Second, the genre called \"business books\" is nebulous and can range from memoirs and essays to financial tips and management strategies. Trump\u2019s book can certainly be shelved in the business section, as it\u2019s both a memoir by a business executive and offers business advice. But experts say it can hardly count as influential in the subcategories or important in the broader genre. \"Trump is full of B.S.,\" said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of business management at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business. \"The best selling/most important business books would have to be In Search of Excellence by (Thomas) Peters and (Robert) Waterman that started the genre, Built to Last by Jim Collins, The One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.\" The Art of the Dealisn\u2019t used in business schools like Michael Porter\u2019s Competitive Strategy, nor is it a text business executives find useful like Machiavelli's The Prince, said Lawrence White, a business and economics professor at New York University's Stern School. As for prominent biographies of business executives, Daniel Raff, who teaches at Trump\u2019s alma mater of Wharton, listed books about Steve Jobs and by Lee Iacocca. We looked at some of these titles and, for good measure, threw in Dale Carnegie\u2019s How to Win Friends & Influence People, which promises pathways to attain professional goals (Warren Buffett is a fan), and Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s personal finance guide, Rich Dad Poor Dad. The authors and publishers of these popular books offer self-reported estimates; we\u2019ve also included the independently compiled Nielsen data. Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s book stacks up: Title Published Estimated sales Nielsen data (since 2001) How to Win Friends & Influence People 1936 15 million 2.27 million The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 1989 10 to 25 million 2.18 million Rich Dad Poor Dad 2000 4 million (as of 2004) 6.99 million Steve Jobs (hardcover edition) 2011 3 million 1.74 million The Art of the Deal 1987 1 million 177,000 Competitive Strategy 1980 NA (60 editions) 71,000 In Search of Excellence 1982 3 million (as of 2001) 54,000 Whether you\u2019re looking at estimated sales or actual figures from Nielsen BookScan, The Art of the Deal has sold fewer copies than at least four other books. Our ruling Trump said his 1987 memoir TheArt of the Deal is \"the No. 1 selling business book of all time.\" The highest estimate pins the number of sales at 1 million, which we weren\u2019t able to verify. According to one source of sales data, The Art of the Deal sold 184,000 physical copies since 2001. There are no lists of all-time sales, but we weighed The Art of the Deal against other popular books in its genre. While the book was very successful, it comes nowhere near claiming the title of top seller. Dale Carnegie\u2019s How to Win Friends and Influence Peopleand Stephen Covey\u2019s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People easily outpace it. We rate the claim False.",

Longtime coach Joe Paterno, who had supervised him, was fired.Before the bill passed, a long list of professionals were required to report abuse, but employees of higher education institutions and organized youth activities were not.During the Senate debate on the legislation, Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, a Gresham Democrat, spoke briefly in favor of the mandatory reporter expansion.\"It really will help all adults recognize their responsibility to protect our kids,\" she told her colleagues. \"In 2010, about 75 percent of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by those required to report by law. It is clear, very clear, that mandatory reporting is a very important tool to keep our kids safe.\"We thought a quick check on her 75 percent figure would be interesting.As always, we started with the speaker and gave Monnes Anderson\u2019s office a call. Molly Woon, a spokeswoman for the Senate Democrats, pointed us to the 2010 Child Welfare Data Book published by the Oregon Department of Human Services.According to the report, which was released last March, 74.4 percent of the abuse and neglect cases were reported by school and medical officials, police, clergy, child-care providers, court and mental health personnel and therapists -- all of whom are required to report. The other 25 percent of reports came from the abusers themselves, parents or, according to department spokesman Gene Evans, victims, relatives, friends, neighbors, ex-live-ins, ex-spouses and anonymous reporters.The figures make this claim an easy one to rule on. Monnes Anderson said 75 percent of the abuse and neglect reports the state collected in 2010 came from mandatory reporters. The Department of Human Services backs her up. We rate this claim True.",

It\u2019s a smear campaign because he has nothing he wants to talk about in his \u2014 what is he running on? What is he running on?\u201d \u2014 exchange on 60 Minutes, Oct. 25, 2020 About a month before the 2020 presidential election, the New York Post revealed that it had obtained emails from Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, which a Delaware repair-shop owner said he had abandoned. That laptop \u2014 and its contents \u2014 are center stage again as congressional Republicans have argued that social-media suppression of the story \u2014 and mainstream media ignoring it \u2014 may have swung the election to Biden. Advertisement Nothing happens in a vacuum. For many political journalists and social media companies, the New York Post reporting on the emails was deja vu. The leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta may have contributed to Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in 2016. WikiLeaks slowly doled out the documents for maximum impact \u2014 and it was later determined that the hacks were orchestrated by operatives with ties to the Russian government, which had favored Trump. News organizations vowed to do better in 2020 and be extra cautious with hacked materials. Complicating matters was that the source of the hard drive, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, refused to share it with other news organizations, including The Washington Post and the New York Times. Few were willing to report information in the New York Post stories without their own due diligence, especially if Russia was once again seeking to meddle in the election. Advertisement Twitter, operating under its hacked material protocol developed after the 2016 election, blocked users from sharing the New York Post story \u2014 a decision officials later said was a mistake. A major question was the origin of the materials. The story that Hunter Biden turned over for repair a laptop filled with sensitive materials \u2014 and then never picked it up \u2014 seemed rather fantastic. On Oct. 16, a week before the final presidential debate, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) told CNN: \u201cWell we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin. ... Clearly, the origins of this whole smear are from the Kremlin, and the president is only too happy to have Kremlin help and try to amplify it.\u201d That prompted a response on Oct. 19 from the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe: \u201cLet me be clear: The intelligence community doesn\u2019t believe that, because there is no intelligence that supports that. And we shared no intelligence with Chairman Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign.\u201d Advertisement That night, Politico published a story with an explosive headline: \u201cHunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.\u201d The article said that more than 50 former senior intelligence officials, including five CIA chiefs, had signed a letter saying the release of the emails \u201chas all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\u201d That\u2019s what Biden referred to in the presidential debate and on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 though his wording was much stronger than the letter\u2019s. Biden said the letter said the laptop story was a \u201cRussian plan,\u201d \u201ca bunch of garbage,\u201d \u201cdisinformation from the Russians\u201d and \u201ca smear campaign.\u201d The letter artfully does not say any of those things. In fact, it does not even say what the Politico headline claimed \u2014 though that headline likely shaped perceptions of the letter that continue to this day. The article itself does not say the letter made a disinformation claim. Advertisement House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Feb. 6 sent letters to 12 of the signers, requesting interviews about a letter he said \u201cfalsely implied the New York Post\u2019s reporting about Hunter Biden was the product of Russian disinformation.\u201d The Fact Checker reached out to the 12 people who received Jordan\u2019s letter. Most did not respond, but we learned that the letter was organized by Michael J. Morell, former deputy director of the CIA, and written and edited by a number of senior intelligence officials who had served in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Morell had long been considered a top candidate for CIA director in a Biden administration, news reports said, but key Democrats objected, claiming he publicly supported the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation methods after the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cThere was message distortion,\u201d former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. told The Fact Checker in a telephone interview. \u201cAll we were doing was raising a yellow flag that this could be Russian disinformation. Politico deliberately distorted what we said. It was clear in paragraph five.\u201d He said he was unaware of how Biden described the letter during the debate. Advertisement \u201cNo one who has spent time in Washington should be surprised that journalists and politicians willfully or unintentionally misconstrue oral or written statements,\u201d said Thomas Fingar, a signer who had been the top intelligence official at the State Department, in an email. \u201cThe statement we signed was carefully written to minimize the likelihood that what was said would be misconstrued, and to provide a clear written record that could be used to identify and disprove distortions.\u201d John Paul Mac Isaac, the Delaware computer repairman, last year sued Politico for defamation, citing Politico\u2019s headline. He also sued Schiff and CNN over the Schiff interview, as well as the Daily Beast for reporting the laptop had been \u201cstolen.\u201d The Daily Beast has apologized and retracted that statement; it has been dropped from the lawsuit. In a statement to The Fact Checker, Politico said: \u201cThe article fairly and accurately reported on \u2014 and summarized \u2014 the intelligence officials\u2019 letter. More specifically, the headline is a fair summary of their allegations, the subhead offers additional context, and the first paragraph of the article hyperlinks to the letter itself, allowing readers to draw their own conclusion.\u201d Advertisement The headline has not been updated since the article was published. The subhead said: \u201cMore than 50 former intelligence officials signed a letter casting doubt on the provenance of a New York Post story on the former vice president\u2019s son.\u201d Let\u2019s examine what the letter says. Dissecting the letter \u201cWe are all individuals who devoted significant portions of our lives to national security. Some of us served in senior positions in policy departments and agencies, and some of us served in senior positions in the Intelligence Community. Some of us were political appointees, and some were career officials. Many of us worked for presidents of both political parties.\u201d Analysis: This is boilerplate intended to signify the importance of the signers. \u201cWe are all also individuals who see Russia as one of our nation\u2019s primary adversaries. All of us have an understanding of the wide range of Russian overt and covert activities that undermine US national security, with some of us knowing Russian behavior intimately, as we worked to defend our nation against it for a career. A few of us worked against Russian information operations in the United States in the last several years.\u201d Advertisement Analysis: This sets the stage to bring Russia into the conversation. \u201cPerhaps most important, each of us believes deeply that American citizens should determine the outcome of elections, not foreign governments. All of us agree with the founding fathers\u2019 concern about the damage that foreign interference in our politics can do to our democracy.\u201d Analysis: This provides a nonpartisan reason to explain why the letter was written. \u201cIt is for all these reasons that we write to say that the arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden\u2019s son Hunter, much of it related to his time serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\u201d Analysis: Note that the letter refers to a Russian \u201cinformation operation\u201d \u2014 not disinformation. Within the national security community, there\u2019s a difference. \u201cInformation operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical information about an adversary as well as the dissemination of propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent,\u201d says the Rand Corp. Disinformation, by contrast, is false information deliberately intended to mislead. Two signers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believed the letter was carefully phrased to highlight the possibility of information operations \u2014 the dissemination of materials designed to have an impact, whether true or not. But Clapper disagreed. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a difference without a distinction. It could have been bad information, false information,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had no evidence, no inside baseball that it was. The intent of the letter was that this could be Russian disinformation \u2014 emphasis on could. It\u2019s a very important nuance \u2026 a distinction that people are always ignoring.\u201d \u201cWe want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement \u2014 just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.\u201d Analysis: This paragraph five \u2014 a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card \u2014 is intended to provide plausible deniability if Russian involvement is not proven. One of the signers, Douglas Wise, a former Defense Intelligence Agency deputy director, recently told the Australian that the signers believed that much of the laptop was legitimate or else any Russian plan to influence the elections would fail. (After all, none of the leaked emails from 2016 were shown to be false.) \u201cAll of us figured that a significant portion of that content had to be real to make any Russian disinformation credible,\u201d he said. Three other signers told The Fact Checker that Wise was on target. \u201cFrom my experience, the most effective disinformation campaigns \u2014 what were called Soviet \u2018active measures\u2019 when I first encountered them during the Reagan administration \u2014 build on factual information,\u201d Fingar said. \u201cPure fiction is less likely to fool target audiences. I suspect but do not know that other signers have drawn the same lessons.\u201d \u201cAt that point in time, it smelled like a Russia information operation,\u201d said another signer, which he said would make sense only if a significant amount of the material was true but was being weaponized to affect the election. Such certitude about the authenticity of much of the laptop data is not reflected in the letter. Clapper, for his part, disagreed that it could be assumed at the time that many of the laptop emails were legitimate. \u201cI did not examine the laptop,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not know the content. So I don\u2019t think I could subscribe to that.\u201d \u201cIf we are right, this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.\u201d Analysis: \u201cIf we are right\u201d is another \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. \u201cThere are a number of factors that make us suspicious of Russian involvement.\u201d Analysis: The letter begins to make its case for a Russian role in the dissemination of the laptop emails. \u201cSuch an operation would be consistent with Russian objectives, as outlined publicly and recently by the Intelligence Community, to create political chaos in the United States and to deepen political divisions here but also to undermine the candidacy of former Vice President Biden and thereby help the candidacy of President Trump. For the Russians at this point, with Trump down in the polls, there is incentive for Moscow to pull out the stops to do anything possible to help Trump win and/or to weaken Biden should he win. A \u2018laptop op\u2019 fits the bill, as the publication of the emails are clearly designed to discredit Biden.\u201d Analysis: The letter argues Russia is trying a replay of 2016. \u201cSuch an operation would be consistent with some of the key methods Russia has used in its now multiyear operation to interfere in our democracy \u2014 the hacking (via cyber operations) and the dumping of accurate information or the distribution of inaccurate or misinformation. Russia did both of these during the 2016 presidential election \u2014 judgments shared by the US Intelligence Community, the investigation into Russian activities by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and the entirety (all Republicans and Democrats) on the current Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201d Analysis: Again, the argument is that Russia\u2019s success in 2016 would embolden it to try again in 2020. \u201cSuch an operation is also consistent with several data points. The Russians, according to media reports and cybersecurity experts, targeted Burisma late last year for cyber collection and gained access to its emails. And Ukrainian politician and businessman Adriy Derkach, identified and sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for being a 10-year Russian agent interfering in the 2020 election, passed purported materials on Burisma and Hunter Biden to Giuliani.\u201d Analysis: The letter speculates that Russia is responsible for obtaining the laptop and getting it into Giuliani\u2019s hands. Interestingly, this part of the letter suggests the laptop data might be real \u2014 but it was stolen to sway the election. \u201cOur view that the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue is consistent with two other significant data points as well. According to The Washington Post, citing four sources, \u2018U.S. intelligence agencies warned the White House last year that Giuliani was the target of an influence operation by Russian intelligence.\u2019 In addition, media reports say that the FBI has now opened an investigation into Russian involvement in this case. According to USA Today, \u2018 \u2026 federal authorities are investigating whether the material supplied to the New York Post by Rudy Giuliani \u2026 is part of a smoke bomb of disinformation pushed by Russia.\u2019\u201d Analysis: The letter cites media reports suggesting Russian involvement. \u201cWe do not know whether these press reports are accurate, but they do suggest concern within executive branch departments and agencies that mirrors ours. It is high time that Russia stops interfering in our democracy.\u201d Analysis: Another \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card \u2014 the letter says the signers have no idea if the media reports are accurate, even though it just cited them. The Bottom Line The letter does not clearly say the Hunter Biden laptop was a \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d program, notwithstanding the Politico headline. In fact, the letter mainly argues that Russia may have had a role in obtaining and disseminating Hunter Biden\u2019s emails \u2014 which could mean as little as Russian bots spreading awareness on social media. But it was to Joe Biden\u2019s advantage to misleadingly embrace the message conveyed in the headline \u2014 just as, for political reasons, for Republicans to continue to make that claim as well.

        "claim": "Says the main Central Texas food bank is delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than three years ago.",
        "doc": "In a September 2011 floor speech, Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin spoke of two concerns he said are growing in the Lone Star State: poverty and hunger.Doggett said that in tough times, more families are turning to food banks, creating \"immense\" demand. Among his examples: The Austin-based Capital Area Food Bank of Texas \"this year is delivering 50 percent more food to poor people than it did three years ago.\"In his speech, Doggett attributed that figure to John Turner, a food bank official. We wondered if the proclaimed increase was correct, and if so, whether that accurately reflected a surge in hunger in our area.The food bank, founded in 1981, takes in donations of food and money from the government, the food industry and the public, then distributes food to Central Texas residents directly and through more than 350 agencies in its 21-county service area roughly centered on Travis and Williamson counties. (Click to view a map.) The region\u2019s north edge runs from Mills County in the west to Freestone County in the east; its south edge runs from Gillespie and Blanco counties in the west to Fayette County on the east.Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us by email that Doggett drew his 50 percent figure from a Sept. 4, 2011, news story in the Guardian, a British newspaper, which quotes Turner saying the food bank was delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than it had done three years ago.In an interview, Turner, the food bank\u2019s senior director for marketing and branding, recently told us he\u2019d given the Guardian a conservative estimate: The pounds of food distributed by the bank had actually increased 64 percent, going from 15.4 million pounds in 2007 to 25.3 million pounds in 2010. Turner noted, too, that the 2010 poundage was inflated by one-time federal stimulus aid enabling the bank to buy an additional 2.3 million pounds for the Summer Food Nutrition Program. Subtract that, and the 2010 figure becomes 23 million pounds -- up 49 percent from what the bank gave out in 2007.So, do the poundage figures mean hunger in the area shot up 49 percent or more over the past few years?J.C. Dwyer of the Texas Food Bank Network, the state association of food banks, told us pounds of food distributed generally isn't the best measure of need in a food bank's region: \"It\u2019s more of a metric for how we\u2019re dealing with the needs,\" Dwyer said. A better way of gauging needs, he said, is to track the number of residents requesting food assistance.That is, the amount of food distributed doesn't necessarily reflect ups and downs in need. In the holiday season, donations and distributions surge, for instance, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean surges in need.Dwyer and Turner each suggested we check on changes in food demands through \"Hunger in America,\" a report commissioned every four years by Feeding America, a national charity that acts as a clearinghouse connecting food supplies to 200 food banks, including the one in Austin.There was no \"Hunger in America\" report for 2007, the first year in Doggett\u2019s statement, but the reports based on surveys in 2005 and 2009 were broken down into smaller reports covering the Austin bank\u2019s 21-county region: In 2005, the Capital Area bank fed an estimated 174,900 people. In 2009, the estimated number of people served was 284,900 for the year, up 63 percent from those who were served in 2005. That change outstripped population growth, according to U.S. census estimates. In 2005, the 21 counties had 2,265,981 residents. By 2009, the region\u2019s population was 2,547,559 -- up 12.4 percent. Put another way, the food bank provided sustenance to nearly 8 percent of the region\u2019s residents in 2005 while about 11 percent of a greater total of residents got food in 2009.Finally, we wondered if Doggett was correct in saying the food aid went to the poor alone.Turner told us the bank does not question people who come seeking food as to their income -- if you show up, you are fed, he said, though depending on the lines that form, it could take an hour or two. However, the \"Hunger in America\" report using 2009 data states that 73 percent of the Capital Area food bank\u2019s clients had incomes below the federal poverty level.Census figures for 2010, drawing on 2009 data, show that poverty in the 21-county region matched the percentage for Texas overall: Seventeen percent of residents had income below the federal poverty level. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Dwyer told us, \"food insecurity\" across Texas -- the percentage of households at risk of missing meals because of financial pressure -- rose from 14.8 percent in the three-year period 2005-07 to 18.8 percent in 2008-10.Our conclusion: Changes in the amount of food distributed over several years, which Doggett cited, might not be the best way to gauge changes in residents\u2019 needs. That said, the number of Central Texas requestors for food aid over those years outpaced regional population growth. The 63 percent increase in requestors also exceeded the 50-percent increase in food distributed that he stressed, though, contrary to his statement, not all those pounds of food went to \"the poor.\"We rate the claim Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Says Florida is one of a few or perhaps the only state \"that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions.\"",
        "doc": "Here's a secret about floor sessions of the Florida House of Representatives -- they can get pretty repetitive. Most legislators ask questions about bills that they already know the answers to, and are simply asking the questions to make political points. Most amendments offered by Democrats in the GOP-dominated body fail. And most always, a bill's fate is known well ahead of time.But for hours, members go through a ritualistic sparring that -- to the first-time viewer -- can look unscripted.We start with that description, because we fact-checkers must admit to sometimes being guilty of tuning it all out.That is, until, our name is being called.The situation occurred on April 21, 2011, during a debate about a bill that would ease the amount of oversight the state Department of Community Affairs has over local land use issues. HB 7129 was going to pass, after all. The debate was academic.But Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, shook us awake with his floor remarks advocating on behalf of the bill.\"This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do,\" he said. \"I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state.\"First off, thanks, Rep. Dorworth, for the plug.The issue here is the state Department of Community Affairs' ability to review local comprehensive plans and amendments, and more specifically, to determine whether or not they are in compliance with state growth management laws. If the DCA finds a local comprehensive plan not in compliance, a judge is asked to settle the discrepancy.Dorworth and others want to relax that oversight, believing it can be unnecessary and burdensome. As Dorworth suggested, he also believes it's a one-of-a-kind standard in the United States. HB 7129 prescribes a more-streamlined process that attempts to cut the DCA review period in half, and strip some of the power the state agency now has to object to local land use decisions.We let Dorworth know that we were taking his challenge to fact-check his claim, and he said he has asked10 different times if another state has Florida's system of review. \"No one seemed to know,\" he told us. \"People said Oregon has something like ours, but then they said that it's not the same.\"Understanding Florida's systemWithout getting too technical, we're not talking about a state review of every land use decision a local government makes (Dorworth oversimplified things in his original statement, which we will factor in when making our ruling). We're talking about comprehensive plans, which offer rough guidance on how a community can develop over time. The plan and corresponding maps let you knowwhere the agricultural land in an area is -- and what someone can possibly build there -- and where a city defines its urban core and what can go along with that.Asmunicipalities grow, they sometimes want or are asked to redraw their plans to accommodate more dense development. A common example would be wanting to designate agricultural or rural land for a more intense use. Florida has a very prescribed process for that, which includes time for the state to review the amendment and public hearings at the local level. (Here's a flow chart to help you follow.)If the local government approves the amendment, DCA then decides whetherit is in compliance with state law. If the DCA deems the amendment is not in compliance, the local government is often asked to alter its plan, or to take the matter to court. In a contentious case, it's a judge who ultimately decides whether or not the amendment is permitted.The system in other statesRather than checking the 49 other states individually to see whether Dorworth is correct, we got a road map of places to examine from Stuart Meck, an associate research professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has written about state planning. He said several states, including Florida, had some level of state review of local land use decisions -- though the level of oversight varied. At each stop, we asked state planners or planning experts what other states might include stringent reviews of some local planning decisions.Most all states have some sort of appellate review of planning decisions, whether it's through the state government or through the courts, or both. But as we searched over the course of a week, we built a final list of suspects that most mirror Florida. They are the states of Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Vermont and Rhode Island.In the Northeast, Vermont and Rhode Island have similar laws that give the state oversight over land use decisions, but only if local governments want to participate in state development grant programs. It's a carrot approach, said Jared Rhodes, the chief of Rhode Island's Division of Planning.In Rhode Island, a state review of local comprehensive plan amendments is essentially required, Rhodes said. But if the state does not approve of the amendment, it is still considered valid. \"A state denial does not necessarily put the brakes on it,\" he said.In Vermont, municipalities have the option of submitting plans and plan amendments to state-created regional planning commissions. Local governments that receive approvals from the regional planning commissions can then be eligible for state grant funding, said Joss Besse, the director of community planning with the Vermont Department of Housing and Community Affairs.In Washington, local governments are required to send prospective land use changes to the state's Department of Commerce for review. But the state provides only technical assistance and does not override local decisions. \"State agency written correspondence will not state that local plans are out of compliance with the (growth management act),\" the state says on its website. \"State agencies may express concerns, but conclusory statements as to compliance will be avoided.\" Oregon's rules -- which were created in 1973 -- are more stringent, and built the framework for Florida's law, former DCA secretary Tom Pelham told us.All Oregon cities and counties are required to have a comprehensive plan, and those plans must be approved by a seven-member state board. That was finished by 1985, said Bob Rindy, senior policy analyst and legislative coordinator with the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development. But when plans are amended, Rindy said, typically there is not much oversight.Local plan amendments are considered finalized 21 days after they are adopted by the local government unless someone appeals. Appeals, which can be initiated by the state or other affected parties, are first heard by a state Land Use Board of Appeals and then could enter the state court system.The rules are different, though, when local jurisdictions seek to expand their urban growth boundaries. Those expansions need the approval of the state, Rindy said. \"When cities try and move out into farmland to grow larger, then the state has oversight over the decision how much they expand that boundary by,\" he said. \"That's one of the things that puts us in the limelight.\"And then there is Hawaii, which by our estimation has the most state-level oversight of planning decisions -- even more so than in Florida.The state of Hawaii's Land Use Commission holds sweeping power over granting development rights outside the urban centers of the island chain, said David L. Callies, Kudo Professor of Law at the University of Hawaii, who was written a book about Hawaii's system for land use planning.The commission, appointed by the governor, decides whether land should be classified Agriculture, Conservation, Urban or Rural. Only in the Urban district, which makes up less than 4 percent of land in the state, do local land use controls like zoning apply without shared authority by the Land Use Commission, Callies said. If property owners wish to reclassify their land in order to develop it, they must receive the permission of the Land Use Commission.Callies said the commission generally accepts large-lot development projects in the Agriculture district. But, if \"your land is in Conservation, you almost have no chance.\" Callies says the system is the most regulated in the country, and that going from raw land to completed development could take 10 years.Our rulingThis is a tough claim to rule on for a couple of reasons. First, Dorworth oversimplified things when he said Florida reviews local land use decisions. The state review is of changes to comprehensive plans. Second, Dorworth said only that hemight be right that Florida is the only state in the country with a state review procedure.Our analysis shows that Florida has a unique form of state review, but it's not the only state to have some oversight.Some are certainly less stringent. Vermont and Rhode Island offer incentives to provide oversight, while Washington offers just technical assistance to local governments.Oregon is similar in that major changes -- in its case, an expansion of the urban service boundary -- require state approval.And Hawaii has a system with a great amount of state oversight.Here's what Dorworth said: \"This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do. I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state.\"If you look at each sentence, Dorworth's first sentence is largely true, his second sentence is really not (except for adding might), and his third sentence is somewhere in between.The best way to explain this, perhaps, is to say that many states have procedures to review some local planning decisions, but Florida has more regulatory authority than most states. Acknowledging there is some room for debate here, we rate this claim Half True.",

        "claim": "Noynoy Aquino staged his death in an attempt to boost the presidential candidacy of Leni Robredo in the 2022 elections",
        "doc": "A video on YouTube is touting a conspiracy theory that the late President Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino III staged his death in an apparent attempt to boost the presidential candidacy of former Vice President Leni Robredo in last year's election.This is not true. The former president passed away on June 24, 2021 or a little over six months before the official start of the 2022 general election period. He died of renal disease secondary to diabetes.On May 17, a YouTube channel uploaded the video with the spurious headline: \"JUST NOW: OMG! KUMPIRMADO PNOY nagtatago lang sa AMERICA? PNOY at KRIS BlNUNYAG ng isang SAKSI? ([Aquino] confirmed to be hiding in America? A witness exposed [him and his sister Kria Aquino]?)\"At around the 50-second mark of the 23-minute video, the narrator claimed that Aquino apparently died in the middle of the 2022 national election campaign and said that aside from the ex-president's personal driver, no medical professional or any of the late president's family witnessed his death.As several news media reported, Aquino was brought to the Capitol Medical Center early morning of June 24, 2021 after his aides saw his lifeless body in his bedroom. He was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. and later cremated. He was laid to rest at the Manila Memorial Park two days after.The narrator of the untrue video further said Kris Aquino also faked her illness after her brother's death \"failed\" to help Robredo's campaign. Another falsehood.The former TV host and actress is now in the United States battling five autoimmune diseases, according to a health update on her official Instagram account.This erroneous video emerged a week after Robredo launched her 388-page coffee table book entitled \"Tayo Ang Liwanag,\" which chronicles her volunteer-driven campaign for the presidency.YouTube channel PINAS NEWS INSIDER (created on Dec. 26, 2015) published the video, garnering over 125,000 views and 4,400 interactions.Have you seen any dubious claims, photos, memes, or online posts that you want us to verify?

        "lang": "en",
        "claim": "When President Bush took office in 2001, he inherited a $236 billion budget surplus, with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. When he ended his term, he left a $1.3 trillion deficit and a projected 10-year shortfall of $8 trillion.",
        "doc": "It's the war of the op-eds. On Jan. 10, 2009, former Bush administration adviser Karl Rove wrote in the Washington Post that Democrats \"will run up more debt by October than Bush did in eight years. (We checked his claim here.) David Axelrod, chief adviser to President Barack Obama, fired back on Jan. 15 in Post that Rove had it all wrong and that Bush had been the big spender. \"The day the Bush administration took over from President Bill Clinton in 2001, America enjoyed a $236 billion budget surplus -- with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion,\" Axelrod wrote. \"When the Bush administration left office, it handed President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit -- and projected shortfalls of $8 trillion for the next decade.\" His point was that it was Bush, not Obama, who got the country in a financial mess. He said Bush approved big-ticket items during his tenure that included tax cuts, a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which allowed the government to spend up to $700 billion to shore up troubled assets and bolster various industries. And now, Axelrod wrote, the Obama administration is stuck with the bill. We wondered whether Axelrod's numbers were correct. When we asked for his sources, the White House pointed us to several documents. The first was a 2002 report from the Congressional Budget Office, an independent agency, that reported the 2000 federal budget ended with a $236 billion surplus. So Axelrod was right on that point. The report provides an interesting trip down memory lane, when budget estimates were downright cheery: \"The outlook for the federal budget over the next decade continues to be bright,\" the report said. \"Assuming that current tax and spending policies are maintained, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that mounting federal revenues will continue to outstrip spending and produce growing budget surpluses for the next 10 years.\" Yes, the word \"bright\" was in a budget estimate. That meant big surpluses -- estimated to total about $5.6 trillion by 2011. So Axelrod was right on that, too. Another cheery line: \"Under current policies, total surpluses would accumulate to an estimated $2 trillion over the next five years and $5.6 trillion over the coming decade, and would be sufficient by 2006 to pay off all publicly held debt that is available for redemption.\" The future didn't turn out like that, of course. On Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Obama took office, the CBO reported the deficit was projected to be $1.2 trillion. The 10-year projection was estimated to be about $3.1 trillion. So Axelrod was slightly off on the 2009 deficit (he said $1.3 trillion) but substantially off on the 10-year projection (he said $8 trillion). The White House said Axelrod's number was based on a budget overview published by the Obama administration shortly after Obama took office, when the 2009 deficit was estimated to be $1.5 trillion, totaling about $9 trillion over the next decade. The White House explained that the figure included the $787 billion economic stimulus package. But because Bush was not president when it was approved, they subtracted the appropriate portion of it for each year, to get $1.3 trillion and $8 trillion, respectively, that the Obama White House believed was approved under Bush. Why the $5 trillion difference between the White House and the CBO's projections? Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, said it has to do with fundamental approaches in how the two offices estimate the future. The CBO based its projections on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2010 and that a patch to fix the alternative minimum tax would expire, among other things. The White House does not; instead, it assumes that nothing changes in current law.Gordon and another budget expert we spoke with, Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said they believe the White House approach is more realistic because it assumes current policy will continue.\"I think the president is correct to make the shift,\" said Riedl. \"What current policy looks like makes more sense.\" (However, Riedl disagrees with Axelrod's larger point, that Bush deserves the blame for the big deficit. \"I'd argue that some of the TARP should be assigned to Obama,\" he said. There are only three parts of TARP that are losing money, he said, the auto company bailouts, AIG and the home loan program. Most of the auto bailouts and the home loan program were initiated by Obama, he said.) Back to Axelrod's original claim. His overall point is correct that the government was enjoying a substantial surplus when Bush took office and had a big deficit when he departed. Specifically, Axelrod is right about the surplus Bush began with, and the projected surplus at that point. Axelrod is very close on the deficit at the end of Bush's presidency, but there are two different ways to measure the 10-year projection when Bush left office. The CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. So given that discussion, we'll take Axelrod down a notch to Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\"In 2018, Biden lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\"",
        "doc": "Sen. Bernie Sanders argues that former Vice President Joe Biden sided with a Republican effort to cut Social Security. \"In 2018, Biden lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare,\" wrote the Sanders campaign in a Jan. 7 newsletter. The night before on CNN, Sanders had attacked Biden\u2019s record on Social Security and Medicare. Ryan is a former Republican House speaker who proposed sweeping changes to Social Security that were never enacted. We found that the Sanders campaign newsletter distorts what Biden said about Ryan\u2019s plan. The Sanders campaign pointed to a speech Biden gave to the Brookings Institution in April 2018. Biden\u2019s overall message was that \"folks in the middle class are in trouble\" and that the tax code \"is widely skewed toward taking care of those at the very top.\" Biden argued that tax cuts were creating more debt, putting middle class programs at risk. The Sanders campaign plucked out what Biden said about Ryan, but ignored the complete passage which showed that Biden wanted Social Security and Medicare protected, and to accomplish that goal would require making changes to the tax code. The thrust of his point about the tax code was that he was saying it does too much to help the uber rich. This is what Biden said about Ryan: \"Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What\u2019s the first thing he decided we had to go after?\" Biden said, with a slight smirk. Biden then leaned into the microphone and said in a deep menacing voice: \"Social Security and Medicare.\" Biden continued: \"Now, we need to do something about Social Security and Medicare.\" He then sarcastically whispered: \"That\u2019s the only way you can find room to pay for it.\" The Biden campaign said that he was mocking Ryan. To understand Biden\u2019s tone, you have to actually watch and listen to his words. The snippet of written text, which the Sanders\u2019 campaign newsletter used, doesn\u2019t relay Biden\u2019s full point. The Sanders campaign omits what Biden said next (our emphasis is in bold): \"Now, I don\u2019t know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire. I don\u2019t know a lot of them. Maybe you guys do. So we need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of unprotective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country.\" We sent Biden\u2019s speech to Marc Goldwein, senior vice president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"The 2018 speech is very clearly Biden saying the opposite of what the Sanders campaign is claiming. He\u2019s saying that Paul Ryan is going to cut taxes so that he can complain about the deficit and demand a need to cut Social Security.\" Biden was previously critical of Social Security and Medicare proposals by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Ryan, his running mate in 2012. RELATED FACT-CHECK: Biden said Romney and Ryan support \"massive cuts in Social Security for future generations\" During the 2020 campaign, Biden promised to \"prevent cuts to American retirees.\" The reality is that if nothing changes, the $1 trillion-a-year Social Security program is on track to run out of reserves by about 2035. RELATED STORY: Social Security: A critical program with an uncertain future A Sanders campaign newsletter said, \"In 2018, Biden lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\" That stems from a speech Biden gave in 2018 in which he spoke about Ryan. Biden appeared to be mocking Ryan, not praising him. The Sanders campaign omitted what Biden said next: the importance of protecting Social Security and Medicare and to change the tax code, which he said benefitted the mega rich. Overall, the point of Biden\u2019s speech was to criticize tax cuts for the rich and call for more help to the middle class. The Sanders campaign plucked out part of what Biden said but omitted the full context of his comments. We rate this statement False.",

        "doc": "Following the ISRO's recent launch of Chandrayaan-3 on 14 July 2023, different sets of visuals (here & here) seemingly depicting a rocket launch captured from an airplane are being shared widely. These visuals are being claimed to showcase the launch of Chandrayaan-3, with assertions that a passenger captured them while traveling onboard a flight. Through this article let's fact-check the claim made in the post.Claim: Visuals showcasing the launch of Chandrayaan-3, captured by a passenger traveling onboard a flight. Fact: While one of the videos reportedly shows the launch of SpaceX Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral in November 2022, the other video depicts the launch of an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral in May 2021. It is also true that some passengers travelling in a Chennai to Dhaka flight captured the launch of Chandrayaan-3. However, the viral visuals are not related to Chandrayaan-3. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.After the ISRO's recent launch of Chandrayaan-3 on 14 July 2023, Twitter users swiftly shared visuals purporting to be the Chandrayaan-3 launch taken from a flight. Notably, IndiGo Airlines released visuals of the Chandrayaan launch, captured by one of their passengers named Mr. Ponraj during a Chennai to Dhaka flight. These visuals gained significant traction on social media platforms, leading various news agencies to report on their viral spread (here & here).However, the visuals disseminated through other viral posts on social media are old and are not related to the recent Chandrayaan-3 launch.Video 1:The visuals in question, which are old, reportedly depict the launch of a rocket by Space X from Cape Canaveral in Florida back in November 2022. A reverse image search conducted on the screenshots from this viral video led us to a couple of news reports published in December 2022, which featured the same visuals (here & here).According to these reports, TikTok user @chefpinkpr a flight attendant who was working during the plane journey, captured these viral visuals. Sharing these visuals on TikTok, the user wrote \"My plane flew by Cape Canaveral and caught the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch!\".However, the date of launch is unclear as a Twitter user shared similar visuals captured from another angle in November 2022. He shared these visuals claiming to depict the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 over Cape Canaveral. A further search yielded reports of the launch of Space X Falcon 9 over Cape Canaveral, carrying Intelsat's Galaxy 31 and Galaxy 32 satellites in the month of November 2022 (here & here).While we were unable to independently confirm if these viral visuals are related to the Space X Falcon 9 rocket launch, the fact that these visuals are available on the internet much before the Chandrayaan-3 launch suggests that they are not associated with the recent Chandrayaan-3 launch.Video 2:The visuals in question, which are old, portray the launch of an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral on 18 May 2021, carrying a satellite. Performing a reverse image search on the screenshots from the viral video led us to several news reports that also featured these same visuals (here & here).10 Tampa Bay, which describes itself as an affiliate of CBS reported that the video was shot by photographer Andy Lin and showed the launch of rocket Atlas V, while traveling The Delta flight was traveling from New York to Cancun.The satellite view of Cape Canaveral Space Force Station provides further confirmation that the viral video showcases a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral, not Sriharikota. Although we were unable to independently verify which rocket launch the viral visuals depict, the fact that these visuals are widely available on the internet much before the Chandrayaan-3 launch strongly indicates that they are unrelated to the recent launch.To sum it up, old and unrelated visuals are being shared as the launch of Chandrayaan-3 captured from a flight.",

        "claim": "Says Scott Walker \"gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce.\"",
        "doc": "Before introducing former President Bill Clinton at an Oct. 24, 2014 campaign event in Milwaukee, Democrat Mary Burke leveled a number of criticisms at her election rival, Gov. Scott Walker. Including this one: \"He gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce.\" Typically, when the state offers financial assistance to a company, the company has to create jobs. So what\u2019s going on here? The deal Burke was alluding to a deal offered by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to Ashley Furniture Industries. WEDC is the state\u2019s primary agency for helping businesses create jobs. Walker created it to replace the state Department of Commerce; he heads the WEDC board. Ashley Furniture, based in Arcadia in western Wisconsin, is the country's largest furniture manufacturer and retailer. The deal for the furniture company was reported in late-August 2014 by the Wisconsin State Journal. According to the Madison newspaper, the WEDC board in January 2014 approved a $6 million enterprise zone tax credit that would help Ashley Furniture with a $35 million expansion of its headquarters. More specifically, the $6 million would pay for the relocation of Meyers Valley Creek, which flooded downtown Arcadia and the Ashley plant in 2010, allowing for the company to launch a 480,000-square foot expansion to reconfigure and change the layout of production lines. The company, which the State Journal said had 3,848 Wisconsin employees at the time, did not have to commit to create a certain number of jobs. In fact, the credits would remain in place even if the company laid off as much as half of its workforce within the next several years. Quoting a memo to the WEDC board, the newspaper reported that Ashley Furniture had indicated \"that if the project is not undertaken, it will either downsize or close the Arcadia manufacturing plant completely.\" So, based on what the company was telling the WEDC, the agency was motivated to try to stop the loss of many jobs. The tax credits deal had not been made public because WEDC had not finalized a contract with Ashley Furniture, although the company confirmed to the newspaper that it was seeking state subsidies that include terms allowing for job reductions. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel followed up on the story. Ashley confirmed that the deal would allow the tax credits to stand even if Ashley cut up to half its Wisconsin employment. But the company said it was advertising 200 job openings and had no plans to cut jobs in western Wisconsin. The company said the layoff provision was meant to cover a worst-case scenario -- protecting the company, for example, in case a disastrous fire or flood should force a shutdown and layoffs. Moreover, the deal amounts to a pass-through, rather than cash in Ashley\u2019s pocket, given that the company would be donating $6 million to the City of Arcadia for the flood-control project. WEDC spokesman Mark Maley told us that the WEDC board has discussed giving the tax credits to Ashley for the flood-control project. He would not release details of the board\u2019s closed-door meeting at which the credits were approved, saying there still is not yet a signed contract between the agency and the furniture maker. But he said: \"WEDC is committed to doing whatever it can to work with the company and preserve those jobs.\" Our rating Burke said Walker \"gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce.\" Walker heads the board of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., and that board has approved $6 million in tax credits to aid an expansion of Ashley Furniture. The tax credits would be used toward a flood-control project in the city where the furniture maker is headquartered, but the project clearly is part of the company\u2019s plan to expand. If Ashley did lay off half its workforce, the credits could still remain in place, but since they would be used for a flood-control project, it\u2019s not as though the company could \"keep the money.\" For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

        "doc": "In recent years, Tiger Woods\u2019 personal life has provided fodder for tabloid scandals and now, fake news. In August 2017, the notorious \u201csatirical\u201d web site World News Daily Report falsely reported that a judge in Florida had ordered the golfer to take 137 paternity tests. The famous golf star Tiger Woods has taken another hit this morning as a state court ordered him to undergo a total of 137 paternity tests. The court\u2019s decision comes after request [sic] formulated by 121 women who claim to have been Wood\u2019s [sic] mistresses and to have given birth to his children. The story is fabricated. No such court order has been handed down, and a photograph which the article claims shows \u201cMolly Sanders\u201d and her eight-year-old son \u201cTommy\u201d is, in fact, a stock photograph that can be found ontwo web sites with the description \u201cStock photo of young Caucasian mother with bi-racial 8 year old son smiling.\u201d In 2010, a Florida sex worker known as Devon James filed a paternity lawsuit against Woods, claiming he was the father of her then nine-year-old son. In reality, a 2002 DNA test had already established that another man was the boy\u2019s father, and James\u2019 lawsuit was dismissed, according to Inside Edition. Woods has publicly admitted to multiple instances of infidelity to his former wife Elin Nordegren, and has undergone treatment for sex addiction.

        "claim": "\"In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can\u2019t afford a 1-bedroom apartment.\"",
        "doc": "Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has recently made it a point to support affordable housing, both in her social media posts and in the legislation she brings before Congress. On July 19, Harris introduced the Rent Relief Act to Congress, which would provide assistance in the form of a refundable tax credit to those who make under $100,000 a year and spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. To rally support for the bill, she tweeted, \"In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can\u2019t afford a 1-bedroom apartment.\" She later posted a video that expressed a similar sentiment and repeated the statistic. In 99% of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can\u2019t afford a 1-bedroom apartment. That is outrageous. I've just introduced the Rent Relief Act, so that Americans who spend over 30% of their income on rent can get a portion of that money back. We decided to look into Harris\u2019s statement. Aside from a few minor caveats, the statement is largely accurate. Out of reach? We began by reaching out to Harris\u2019s press secretary, who directed us to a 2017 study published by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled \"Out of Reach.\" The study is updated yearly, and the 2018 edition is out. Harris\u2019s press secretary pointed out a line from the latest study that reads, \"In only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent.\" That statistic and the coalition\u2019s report overall have been cited by various news outlets. Do the math, and you\u2019ll see that 22 divided by 3,000 comes out to a figure slightly smaller than 1 percent. That small percentage refers to the counties where a one-bedroom home is affordable for minimum-wage workers. But there are two concepts in the sentence from the study that require further clarification: affordability and \"fair market rent.\" The national coalition defines \"affordability\" as \"consistent with the federal standard that no more than 30 percent of a household\u2019s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities.\" That\u2019s the same guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and we found it\u2019s a standard threshold within the field. The definition of \"fair market rent\" is slightly different. It also has its origins from HUD. The National Low Income Housing Coalition defines it as \"typically the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units.\" So that means that within any given metropolitan area, 40 percent of all rental properties are priced equal to or below the fair market rent threshold. That means not all units within the 99 percent of counties referred to in Harris\u2019s tweet are unaffordable for full-time minimum-wage workers, but it does mean that a majority \u2014 60 percent \u2014 are. Of the remaining 40 percent of one-bedroom housing, some units may be affordable for those workers, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be quality apartments \u2014 they might be in a high-crime area or low-performing school district, for example. (We previously cleared up the definition of \"fair market rent\" in a fact-check of a Facebook graphic.) As Vincent Reina, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, put it, \"It does not mean there are 0 affordable units (in the 99% of counties that Harris is referring to), it means that there are none affordable at or above the 40th percentile of the rent distribution. There are likely some units that are affordable, just not even close to enough.\" The experts we reached out to pointed out that the conclusions reached by the National Low Income Housing Coalition are supported by other research, including a recent study published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies of Harvard University. \"Not all the studies would support the exact claim that 99 percent of counties in the U.S. are unaffordable, but there\u2019s a lot of evidence that the poorest families (say the bottom 20-25 percent) are financially stretched to afford unsubsidized housing,\" said Jenny Schuetz, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Harris recently tweeted, \"In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can\u2019t afford a 1-bedroom apartment.\" She was referring to a recent study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which shows that \"in only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent.\" Harris didn\u2019t refer to the concept of \"fair market rent,\" which is defined as the \"40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units.\" The underlying study she referenced doesn\u2019t say that a minimum wage worker can\u2019t afford any housing in almost all of the United States, but that a minimum wage worker can\u2019t afford the average-priced housing unit. With that said, Harris\u2019s claim is still a largely accurate characterization of the magnitude of the rent affordability problems that many people face. We rate this claim Mostly True. ",

        "doc": "An image making claims about the number of immigrants, illegal immigrants, asylum seekers and homeless people in the UK has been shared over 14,000 times on Facebook. \"Tories have found homes for over 8.8 million immigrants, illegals & asylum seekers, while ignoring the 350,000 British homeless\". Facebook user In 2017 an estimated 8.8 million people in the UK population were not born in the country. But that doesn't mean the government has \"found homes\" for all those people. Many of these people will own homes, rent privately or won't have had financial support from the government in finding homes. There were an estimated 320,000 homeless people in Great Britain at the start of 2018, but they definitely weren't all British citizens as the post implies. Data on homelessness is imprecise, and that figure is likely to be an underestimate. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in The UN estimated the size of the UK's foreign-born population in 2017 was 8.8 million There are two possible ways of measuring the size of the UK's foreign-born population. The UN reports that the UK's foreign-born population was estimated to be 8.8 million in 2017 . The UN uses census data as well as things like surveys and population registers to put together these figures. We don't know about the nationalities of these people, or how many are refugees. Meanwhile the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports that in 2018 the non-UK born population was 9.3 million . Being born abroad is different from citizenship status: according to the same data, the UK population of people who are not British citizens was 6.1 million . That data comes from the ONS' annual population survey. The ONS and UN figures differ because they use different sources and methodologies to come to their final number. We've talked more about the difference between the ONS data and UN data here . The government didn't \"find homes\" for all of them The idea that the government has \"found homes\" for the UK's entire immigrant population is without any foundation. According to research from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, in 2017, 42% of the foreign-born population owned their home, while 41% were private renters. (Compared to the UK-born population, they are more likely to rent privately and less likely to be home owners.) Those who were born abroad have similar rates of participation in social housing as the UK population, at 17% (compared to 16% for UK-born.) People who have requested asylum are able to get housing assistance while their asylum claim is being assessed if they are destitute. There were just under 32,000 asylum applications made in the year to March 2019. People in the UK illegally are not eligible for government assistance with housing. 320,000 is a realistic figure for the number of homeless people in Great Britain, but it includes people who aren't from the UK Housing charity Shelter estimated that there were at least 320,000 homeless people in Great Britain at the start of 2018. We've talked about this number several times before. Shelter used official homeless statistics for England , Scotland and Wales , submitted FOIs to councils and used the charity Homeless Link's research on the number of homeless hostel spaces. Shelter's definition of homelessness included people in temporary accommodation (including places arranged by children's services), single people in homeless hostels and those sleeping rough. People in temporary accommodation are estimated to account for around 300,000 of the total. Shelter said 320,000 is likely an underestimate, and as we've said before , we think that's probably fair. No one knows exactly how many homeless people are not UK nationals Homelessness charity Crisis said in a 2018 report that migrants \"clearly make up a significant proportion of the rough sleeping and wider homeless population across Britain, but there are significant gaps in data that are collected or published.\" A single night snapshot count of the number of rough sleepers in England during the autumn of 2018 found that about 64% were UK nationals (the nationality of 10% was not known). The data for rough sleepers is more detailed in London. CHAIN (Combined Homelessness and Information Network) is a database recording the number of people found sleeping rough by outreach teams in London. Of those seen rough sleeping in Greater London in 2018/19, just under half were UK nationals. This fact check doesn't address the claim that the government is \"ignoring\" the homeless, which is a statement of opinion.",

        "doc": "As an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline approaches, debate is intensifying over whether Congress should allow the federal government to go deeper in debt. The head of the nation\u2019s central bank went so far as to say the borrowing limit must be raised in order to avert a \"huge financial calamity.\"Seeking cuts in spending, many Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have resisted President Barack Obama\u2019s call to raise the debt limit.In defending his position, Ryan made a pair of striking statistical claims during a Milwaukee radio interview on July 6, 2011.\"We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today,\" he toldJay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM (1130), \"and about half of that comes from countries like China.\"The first part of the statement has to do with the federal deficit, while the second has to do with the debt.As the U.S. Treasury Department points out, a deficit occurs when the government spends more money than it takes in (through taxes, fees and other income). When there\u2019s a deficit, the government borrows money to cover the difference by selling treasury securities. Debt, meanwhile, is the net amount of accumulated deficits.Let\u2019s look at the two halves of the statement.\"We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today\"Conor Sweeney, Ryan\u2019s budget committee spokesman, cited two reports: That puts Ryan\u2019s claim of 42 cents smack in the middle.Our PolitiFact colleagues earlier in 2011 twice evaluated statements nearly identical to Ryan\u2019s, using the same approach Sweeney used. They rated both statements True, even though they were off by 3 cents. To check the most recent data, we used the Treasury Department\u2019s May 2011 revenue and spending report, the latest available when Ryan did the radio interview. It indicates that, for the fiscal year to that point in time, the government borrowed 39 cents for every dollar it spends. Ryan is also within 3 cents of that figure, so we\u2019ll judge his first claim as essentially accurate.Now, to his second claim -- which is more complicated.\"About half of (the borrowing) comes from countries like China\"By saying \"countries like China,\" Ryan meant borrowing the U.S. does from any foreign countries, according to Sweeney. So, for Ryan\u2019s second claim to be accurate, roughly half of the U.S. debt would have to be foreign owned.There is no real dispute that the nation\u2019s total debt exceeds $14 trillion.PolitiFact has twice used that figure in evaluating claims about the proportion of U.S. debt owned by China. In recent days, the New York Times cited the current debt as $14.3 trillion and the Los Angeles Times, in a primer on the debt-limit talks, noted that the debt had reached that level in May 2011. Moreover, the The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It, a daily debt tracking done by the Treasury Department, also shows the debt at $14.3 trillion.Indeed, that figure just about equals the nation\u2019s debt limit -- which explains why there is urgency on the part of those who want to see the limit raised before what the Obama administration says is an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline.But according to Sweeney, Ryan wasn\u2019t referring to that measure at all.Rather, he said, Ryan was pointing to a portion of the total debt, the far less known \"debt held by the public.\"Citing a Congressional Budget Office study, Sweeney called that debt measure \"the most significant measure for economic purposes\" because it excludes treasury securities held by Social Security trust funds and other government accounts.He then pointed to the Treasury Department\u2019s daily debt tracking, which shows total debt at $14.3 trillion, including $9.74 trillion held by the public.Sweeney also cited a Treasury Department report which said foreign investment accounted for $4.49 trillion of U.S. debt as of April 2011. (China, by the way, was the top foreign debt owner, with $1.15 trillion.)Using the $4.49 trillion figure would mean that foreign investors own 46 percent of the debt held by the public, which is the proportion Ryan claimed -- but only 31 percent of the total debt, which is debt measure most familiar to most people.So what\u2019s the bottom line?In an interview about raising the federal government\u2019s debt limit, Ryan made two claims in one statement: \"We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today and about half of that comes from countries like China.\" The first claim is essentially on the money.But we believe Ryan owed his listeners more detail if he expected them to accept his second claim. It has long been widely reported that both the nation\u2019s debt and its debt limit are $14.3 trillion. And that\u2019s what the radio discussion was about. So when Ryan said that half of the nation\u2019s borrowing comes from foreign countries -- singling out China for emphasis -- his listeners would assume he meant half of the $14.3 trillion in total debt, not the much smaller debt measure he now says he was referring to, even if that second measure has strong merit in the debt limit discussion.We rate Ryan\u2019s statement Half True.",

The joke refers to a scene in which his character gets to exact revenge on all the people who imprisoned and brutalized his fictional wife and other Black slaves.

While he did say those words, the 2023 tweet ignored that it was uttered as a joke in reference to Foxx's role in the movie \"Django Unchained.\" It was also scripted(i.e., not extemporaneous) as an introduction to the comedic sketches of the night. In the monologue, titled \"How Black Is That?\" in a video clip on SNL's official YouTube channel, Foxx makes comments and jokes about Blackness by talking about a range of different issues ranging from his nice suit, to former U.S. President Barack Obama, to sports. He also talked about \"Django Unchained,\" in which he played a slave turned bounty hunter who set out to rescue his wife from an evil plantation owner played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Foxx said in the monologue: I got a movie coming out, Django Unchained, check it out. I play a slave. Uh, how black is that? And in the movie I have to wear chains. Umm ... how whack is that? But don't worry about it, because I get out of the chains, I get free, I save my wife, and I kill all the white people in the movie. How great is that? And how black is that? Taken in context, Foxx was simply describing the events of the movie, which was directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie is known for its violence and its brutal depictions of slavery. As such, joking about killing white people in the context of a film in which said white people inflict violence and death on Black slaves, does not seem as problematic as the posts make it out to be. This was not the first time that particular line from the SNL monologue generated outrage. We covered the context around this quote back in 2012 when it first made the rounds. Foxx's Instagram post referencing the killing of Jesus led to widespread controversy, with many saying it referenced a harmful trope against the Jewish community. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) noted in a report, \"The myth that Jews collectively murdered Jesus, also referred to as 'deicide,' has been used to justify violence against Jews for centuries.\" However, social media users defended Foxx's use of the phrase as a common colloquialism used by Black people to describe a betrayal by those closest to you, referring to backstabbers like Judas, and was not used in an antisemitic context. \"They killed Jesus\" is a common black colloquialism to describe betrayal by those close to you. There's not a single black person thinking about disrespecting an ethnic group or religion when we use that term. It's about the behavior of backstabbers like Judas. \u2014 ICY \ud83e\uddc1 (@IcyTheARTIST) August 5, 2023 Foxx wrote in another Instagram post in response to the outrage, \"I want to apologize to the Jewish community [...] I now know my choice of words have caused offense and I'm sorry. That was never my intent. To clarify, I was betrayed by a fake friend and that's what I meant with 'they' not anything more.\" A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) While Foxx did make the statement about \"killing white people,\" in context it was clearly a scripted joke about his role in a movie that depicted the horrors of slavery in a violent way.",

        "claim": "\"By voting to approve [Question 1], we can . . . save 900 jobs\" at Twin River.",
        "doc": "Once again, the state's two slot parlors are rolling the dice in hopes that Rhode Islanders -- along with residents of Lincoln and Newport, where the facilities are located -- will approve referenda permitting the table games that will make them full-fledged casinos.While recent polls show support for the measure, it's anything but a sure bet, and the businesses are spending millions to win support for the measure.One commercial in support of Question 1 is sponsored by Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., a 501(c)4 nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization created by officials at Twin River, in Lincoln, the larger of the two facilities.It features an East Providence woman who talks about the problems of the Rhode Island economy and tells viewers: \"By voting to approve, we can keep revenue right here, save 900 jobs and help create 650 new ones.\" The ad makes no mention of the Newport facility, Newport Grand.We were interested in checking whether defeat of Question 1 would really result in the loss of 900 existing jobs at Twin River.(A comparable proposal, Question 2, would allow table games at Newport Grand.)Twin River and Newport Grand want to add table games to remain competitive with the three casinos and one \"racino\" expected to be created in Massachusetts in the next several years.The fear is that, without the table games, customers will flock to the Bay State instead. The stakes are huge for the Rhode Island state budget: the two businesses accounted for $321 million of revenue in the budget year that ended June 30, 2012 -- about 10 percent of all revenue.So will 900 jobs be lost if Question 1 is rejected?Only if Twin River shuts down completely.It turns out that 900 is roughly the number of workers that Twin River says it employs now.If the referendum is rejected, Twin River will continue operating.In the short term, the first Massachusetts casino is not expected to open its doors for a few years.And even with the Bay State casinos up and running, Twin River can be profitable, said Clyde Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at UMass Dartmouth and an expert on gambling in the region.The assumption in the ad is that if voters don't authorize table games Twin River will close, Barrow said. \"I don't think that's the case. It's true that once the slot parlor casinos are open in Massachusetts, they do stand to lose as much as 50 percent of their net terminal income,\" which was $463 million in 2011.\"Even if Twin River went to a $225-million-a-year operation, that's still a pretty substantial facility,\" said Barrow. \"It's larger than some of the casinos in Atlantic City. So it will definitely have the capacity to still be profitable at a smaller level of operation.\"\"They would certainly have to lay some people off,\" said Barrow, \"But it wouldn't be the full 900.\"We also checked a report commissioned by Gov. Lincoln Chafee that included projections of employment at Twin River with and without table games under various scenarios.In the worst-case scenario, where at least one Massachusetts casino is built near Rhode Island, Twin River would have 397 fewer jobs in 2017 than in 2011 if table games aren't permitted. With table games, the loss would be cut to 118 jobs.But that's just the worst scenario.The report says the likeliest outcome is that 319 jobs would be lost if table games were not allowed, and 201 jobs would be gained if Question 1 were to be passed.Under any scenario, that's not close to 900 jobs.When we contacted Twin River, spokeswoman Patti Doyle said that if there are no table games in Rhode Island, Twin River expects to lose 25 percent to 35 percent of its gambling revenue when Massachusetts casinos open. Twin River expects the competition to be on line by late 2016 or early 2017.\"A gaming revenue decline at Mohegan Sun and Atlantic City brought nearly a parallel reduction in work force,\" she said. \"So, it's safe to assume that a loss of revenue of 25 percent would translate into a 25 percent loss of our workforce.\"A 25 percent to 35 percent reduction would result in cuts of 225 to 315 jobs, not 900.Nonetheless, Doyle says Twin River isn't suggesting that the gambling complex might have to close its doors.\"That's not what the ads are saying, nor are we saying that now,\" she wrote in an e-mail. \"We can say with certainty with table game approval, none of the existing 900 jobs will be lost.\"But that's not what the ad says, nor how most people will perceive it.Our RulingThe Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., an organization pushing for approval of a referendum question to permit table games at Twin River, says that passage would save 900 jobs in Rhode Island.But the only way 900 jobs would be lost at Twin River would be if it closed, and nobody -- including Twin River -- is saying that's going to happen.Even if Twin River had to scale back its operation by 25 percent to 35 percent, that's not close to the 900 positions that Jobs to R.I. says are at risk.Because the company -- based on its own estimates -- is overplaying its hand, offering a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

        "claim": "\"In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare. And they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans.\"",
        "doc": "Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West pulled out some familiar talking points on the 2010 health care law in a recent Fox News interview.It was Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare, he said. An unelected board will make decisions about health care for seniors and all Americans, he said.Similar statements by Republican politicians have earned rulings from Half True to False.But in the world of PolitiFact, specific word choice matters.How do West's words hold up?He spoke with Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Oct. 14, 2011. Here's part of their exchange:CAVUTO: \"There's concern in your state, sir, that going after entitlements and going after the spending in entitlements, that you're going after granny, that you particularly are going after granny. And that's been the one thing the Democrats are trying to stick to you. What do you say?\"WEST: \"Well, they tried that. And, as a matter of fact, they have failed miserably, because, as a matter of fact, in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare. And they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans.\"He then said he supported, instead, the premium support plan that's part of Rep. Paul Ryan's \"Path to Prosperity.\" (Some Democrats have claimed the plan, which shifts the burden for rising health costs to seniors over time, eliminates Medicare. We've ruled that claim False.) We'll look at two claims from the interview, one at a time. The first is that, \"In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare.\" The second is that \"they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans.\"Medicare cutsWe've previously weighed statements that the 2010 health care law \"cut Medicare.\" We've listed many among our sources for this item, but here are a few: The 60 Plus Association said the law \"will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care.\" (We ruled that Mostly False.) On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney said \"Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare.\" (Half True) In Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio said, \"The only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare spending are the people who voted in favor of Obamacare. That\u2019s a fact.\" (Mostly False.)In those fact-checks, we pointed out that the law doesn't take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. It attempts to slow the program's growth, trimming more than $500 billion in projected spending over a decade. Medicare spending will still increase, from $499 billion in 2009 to $929 billion in 2020.But those items include other context West doesn't include \u2014 he isn't talking about quality of care, for example.West didn't attempt to clarify that Democrats cut future spending, or cut the rate of growth. His spokeswoman, Angela Sachitano, provided evidence from the Congressional Budget Office and news sources that the reduction would result in lower projected Medicare spending over a decade. But West merely said \"cut $500 billion from Medicare,\" a misleading oversimplification. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.'Unelected bureaucrats'West's second claim, that the law \"put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans,\" should also be familiar to loyal PolitiFact readers.Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann said something similar in an Oct. 11, 2011, debate: \"These 15 political appointees (on the IPAB) will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans.\" We rated that False.Now, West's claim is more restrained. He doesn't say the board will make \"all the major health care decisions,\" merely that it \"will be making decisions about health care.\"So what is the board, and what is it tasked with?The health care law directs a new national board \u2014 with 15 members who are political appointees \u2014 to identify $15.5 billion in Medicare savings.It's forbidden from submitting \"any recommendation to ration health care,\" as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing.But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. And it wouldn't directly make decisions about health care \"for all Americans.\" Instead, as PolitiFact Georgia has reported, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost. This statement also contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.Our rulingWest used two common talking points in his Fox News interview. The first, which we've checked repeatedly, is that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \"cut $500 billion from Medicare.\" The statement leaves out important details.The second, that the health care law \"put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans,\" also ignores facts that would give a different impression.We recognize it's not always easy to give context in a fast-paced TV interview, but a just few more words (\"will cut projected Medicare spending by\" or \"will be making decisions about Medicare spending\") would have dramatically boosted West's truth quotient. Overall we find his claims Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"[Appalachian Power] wants another 10 percent rate increase. The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22 percent to $8.7 million in 2010.\"",
        "doc": "House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been fighting Appalachian Power Company for two years.Apco won the last round in January, when Republicans in the House of Delegates squashed two Armstrong bills aimed at returning Virginia to its old system of electric utility regulation. Energy lobbyists and the company, alongside Dominion Virginia Power, argued that most of Apco\u2019s price increases in recent years would still have been permitted under the old system and that no change was needed.Armstrong\u2019s latest salvo came March 31, the same day Apco announced it was seeking a series of rate increases in Virginia. He took to Twitter to vent his frustration.\"Apco wants another 10% rate increase. The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22% to $8.7 million in 2010,\" Armstrong wrote.Armstrong has botched up the facts in past attacks on Apco, so we took a look at his latest claims.Apco announced in a March 31 press release it was seeking to raise rates by \"about 10 percent\" for 2012 through a series of rate filings. The actual increase, if granted in full by the State Corporation Commission, which oversees utility regulation in Virginia, would be 9.6 percent. Under the new rate, Apco says, customers would pay $104.99 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours.The company has discussed its proposed rate hikes with Armstrong and other politicians representing Apco customers. Del. Anne Crockett-Stark, R-Wytheville, told The Roanoke Times that she and other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will oppose the company\u2019s rate request when the SCC holds its hearings. Under Virginia\u2019s utility regulations, companies can adjust the \"base rate\" they charge customers every two years. But they also can can also file separate \"rate adjustment cases,\" or \"RACs\" at any time. RACs are designed to cover certain changes in costs, such as a sudden increase in fuel prices -- primarily coal in Apco\u2019s case -- or changes in the cost of meeting environmental regulations.The company requested and received a hefty rate increase for environmental costs about two years ago. In January hearings on Armstrong\u2019s bill, Apco executives said the money was needed to meet stricter air pollution mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency. The utility was adding new air \"scrubbers\" that reduced the amount of pollution, especially sulfur dioxide, released by its coal-fired plants.Apco customers complained that between the biennial base rate increases and RAC changes, they never knew what they would be charged month to month. The company said it has decided to bundle the base rate case and three RACs together this year to avoid that problem, with the aim of altering rates once and then leaving them in place for an extended period of time.In the current request, the firm wants to boost its base rate by about 6.3 percent, then tack on a 3.2 percent increase for environmental costs and a 0.5 percent increase to meet voluntary standards on renewable energy investments. After a slight decrease in generation rates, the requested increase comes to 9.6 percent.So Armstrong\u2019s right about the size of Apco\u2019s requested increase, but what about the CEO\u2019s salary?First, we should note that Michael Morris is not the CEO of Apco, as Armstrong implies. Morris is the CEO of American Electric Power, Apco\u2019s parent company. AEP serves about 5.3 million customers in 11 states, including Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The company operates through several different subsidiaries; Apco serves AEP\u2019s customers in Virginia and West Virginia.Armstrong took the salary information from an article by The Associated Press, which reported that Morris received total compensation of $8.7 million in 2010. The AP said that was a 22 percent increase from 2009.The AP\u2019s salary calculations are based on a company\u2019s annual proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The calculation includes any salary, bonuses and perks, as well as the estimated value of stock options given to the executive in a given year. The AP does not include the change in value of an executive\u2019s pension. That figure is usually included in an executive\u2019s reported salary.According to AEP\u2019s 2010 proxy, Morris was paid $9 million in 2010, up from $7.5 million in 2009. That\u2019s an increase of 20 percent. Morris made $10 million in 2008.AEP does not disclose the salary for Charles Patton, Apco\u2019s CEO.Let\u2019s review our findings.Armstrong\u2019s right that Apco has requested a roughly 10 percent rate increase. The actual request is for a 9.6 percent jump, but even the utility said \"about 10 percent\" in its press release. Readers could easily conclude from his message that Mike Morris is Apco\u2019s CEO. That\u2019s not the case; Morris is actually CEO of American Electric Power, Apco\u2019s parent company. But Armstrong does cite Morris\u2019s 2010 salary, and the increase from 2009, accurately. The salary figures for Apco CEO Charles Patton are not available.We rate this statement True.",

        "doc": "In early April 2021, social media users circulated posts that included a tweet in which Texas state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat, supposedly shared publicly for the first time that he suffers from Type 1 diabetes and said he was authoring new legislation that would cap monthly insulin payments for diabetic Texans. The alleged tweets byTalarico were authentic. On April 6, he shared via his official Twitter account as a Texas legislator side-by-side photos of him presumably being treated for diabetes symptoms at a medical facility and promoting the bill (H.B. 40) at a media event. Over the course of 20 tweets, Talarico shared a story in which he recounted experiencing near-fatal symptoms of Type 1 diabetes during a campaign event in spring 2018, and he ultimately received a diagnose for the chronic condition at age 28. The thread began: 3 years ago I almost slipped into a coma and died. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I paid $684 for my first 30-day supply of insulin. Some pay $1000+ a month. Many die without it. Today I introduced legislation to cap the price of insulin at $50 a month. I haven\u2019t shared this story publicly before. Many accounts, like the one below, thanked the legislator for opening up and shared their own experiences of trying to pay for insulin or seeing loved ones struggle with the costs. The series of tweets went on to explain market conditions affecting the price of insulin syringes or insulin cartridges forpens or pumps. (According to a Congressional analysis in September 2019, insulin averaged $34.75 per dose in the U.S. \u2014 a total that\u2019s almost 2.5 times higher than the average price in other countries.) As a result, Talarico said he authored the bill that would \u201ccap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $50/month,\u201d pending approval his colleagues\u2019 approval. According to legislative records, dozens of lawmakers from both political parties have endorsed the proposal (the text of which is available here). For the first time, they held a public hearing on April 6, the day of Talarico\u2019s tweets. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that people in this state who have diabetes, like me, like thousands of your constituents, do not die because they do not make the money because to afford the medicine that they need to live,\u201d he said at the hearing, according a video obtained by Snopes. As of this writing, the House\u2019s Committee on Insurance was considering the bill, and the Senate had approved its version of it. In sum, considering the tweets from Talarico\u2019s official account, as well as legislative records that list him as the author of H.B. 40 and his comments at the April 6 public hearing in which he discussed his personal medical condition while promoting the legislation, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d",

The Facts The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was adopted in October 2015 and formally implemented on Jan. 16, 2016, by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States \u2014 and Germany and Iran. Iran agreed to constraints meant to ensure that its nuclear program will be used only for peaceful purposes, such as energy production. In exchange, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations agreed to lift a broad range of sanctions on Iran. U.S. allies say the Iran deal has helped maintain stability. Critics of the deal say that the broad lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to increase its influence in a volatile region and that the accord does not restrict Iran from developing ballistic missiles. Advertisement Trump is one of those critics. But it\u2019s not clear what he meant by saying the deal would expire in seven years. The White House did not respond to our questions. The president may have been referring to \u201cTermination Day\u201d in October 2025, when provisions of a U.N. resolution endorsing the deal expire, or he may have been referring to the fact that some provisions of the JCPOA itself expire 10 years into the deal, in 2026. \u201cNevertheless, President Trump\u2019s statement indicates either abject confusion over the parameters of the JCPOA or a willful misinterpretation of that deal,\u201d said Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. \u201cEither way, it is dangerous, as Iran will never be \u2018free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons.\u2019 \u201d As a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has pledged not to develop nuclear weapons \u2014 ever. In agreeing to the JCPOA, Iran recommitted itself to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Bell said. \u201cThe NPT is of indefinite duration and serves as the underpinning for the entire global non-proliferation regime,\u201d she said. Advertisement Iran also has agreed to abide by the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s Additional Protocol. It has committed to ratify this agreement in 2023. The IAEA already has the ability to investigate nuclear facilities and activities disclosed by Iran\u2019s government. The Additional Protocol supplements those powers by giving IAEA investigators the \u201cability to investigate undeclared nuclear facilities and activities by increasing the IAEA\u2019s authority to inspect certain nuclear-related facilities and demand information from member states,\u201d according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service. Simply put, Iran has agreed to give international inspectors wide-ranging authority to peer into its nuclear activities. According to a timeline from the Brookings Institution, Iran would be free to develop, test and use more advanced types of uranium-enriching centrifuges and upgrade a nuclear facility in Natanz after \u201cTermination Day\u201d in October 2025. But Iran would continue to be limited to peaceful programs; developing nuclear weapons would remain banned. The JCPOA limits the number of IR-1 centrifuges Iran may have at its Natanz plant to 5,060, and it restricts the \u201cnumber and type of more advanced centrifuges that may be tested over this period,\u201d according to a timeline from the Nuclear Threat Initiative produced by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif. Those restrictions expire in 2026. (IR-1 centrifuges are decades old and not very efficient.) Advertisement [Note: We previously said these restrictions would expire in 2025, but they actually expire in 2026. The NTI timeline indicated 2025 as the sunset date, but the JCPOA says the provisions expire 10 years after the agreement\u2019s implementation date, which was in 2016.] Other parts of the JCPOA would remain in force for years after 2026, including international monitoring of Iran\u2019s production of uranium ore and centrifuge parts, and restrictions on uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel. (Here are some details and an analysis of the centrifuge restrictions from the New York Times\u2019s Max Fisher.) \u201cMany measures associated with the JCPOA sunset later than seven years, and others do not sunset at all,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. He called Trump\u2019s claim \u201ccompletely false.\u201d Advertisement The JCPOA strengthens the restrictions Iran faces under the Non-Proliferation Treaty in perpetuity, Lewis added. \u201cUnder Article II [of the Non-Proliferation Treaty], Iran may not \u2018manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,\u2019 \u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut did Iran\u2019s pre-2003 nuclear weapons research constitute the \u2018manufacture\u2019 of nuclear weapons? I said yes at the time, but Iran\u2019s defenders said that it did not \u2014 they claimed that research and development fell short of the definition of \u2018manufacture.\u2019 The JCPOA settles this debate by barring Iran from conducting research and development, prohibiting an itemized list of the pre-2003 activities. This provision does not sunset.\u201d Similar processes are involved in pursuing a nuclear energy program and a nuclear weapons program, which is why monitoring is key. Advertisement \u201cIran has nuclear programs that could potentially provide Tehran with the capability to produce both weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium \u2014 the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons,\u201d according to the report from the Congressional Research Service. \u201cStatements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon.\u201d In addition to the production of weapons-grade nuclear material, a nuclear weapons program requires other key elements, such as warhead design and reliable delivery systems. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a skeptic of the Iran deal, and Andrea Stricker, a senior policy analyst at that institute, wrote in an op-ed in January that the nuclear accord potentially opens the door to Iran achieving \u201cbreakout capability\u201d for a nuclear bomb in about a decade. \u201cLeft unchecked, in about a decade Iran will be closer to producing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb \u2014 a \u2018breakout capability\u2019 \u2014 than it was before the agreement was finalized in 2015,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Europeans recognize the danger of allowing the sunset clauses to stand, yet they haven\u2019t offered any serious solutions. They are, however, rebuilding business with the Islamic Republic. Although the nuclear deal placed restrictions on Tehran\u2019s gas centrifuge uranium-enrichment program, the regime will be allowed in just six years to ramp up the centrifuge manufacturing process essential for the production of thousands of advanced centrifuges.\u201d Advertisement It\u2019s worth noting that as part of the JCPOA, Iran said it was bound by this commitment: \u201cIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.\u201d According to the Congressional Research Service report, \u201cOfficials from both the Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations have certified that Iran is abiding by its JCPOA commitments.\u201d The Pinocchio Test It\u2019s fair to be skeptical of the Iran deal. But Trump\u2019s assertion that the JCPOA is set to expire in seven years and that Iran would be free to build nuclear weapons afterward is simply not accurate. Whether the president was referring to \u201cTermination Day\u201d in 2025, or to the portions of the JCPOA that sunset in 2026, Iran has pledged to never develop nuclear weapons. The Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA\u2019s Additional Protocol and other parts of the JCPOA \u2014 all of which Iran has committed to \u2014 run well past 2025, and key provisions apply indefinitely. Advertisement Trump knows how to hedge these types of comments about the Iran deal. He\u2019s done it before. (\u201cThe deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program and, importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout,\u201d he said in an October 2017 speech.)

        "doc": "As President Joe Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan was on its way to congressional passage, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., criticized the bill for being paradoxical. She said it was framed as immediate relief for the coronavirus pandemic and its associated economic impacts, yet it allocated money years into the future, when the pandemic will presumably be over. During a March 4 press conference, Capito said, \"We know that the bill that\u2019s in front of us \u2026 has a lot of money in it for schools, but if you really look at it \u2026 it says that the school money is going to go out until the year 2028. This is supposed to be an emergency bill. It is an emergency to get our schools reopened and our students back to school. We need to get the schools open, and we still have money in the pipeline to do that.\" Is some of the \"school money\" in the $1.9 trillion bill scheduled to go out as late as 2028? The short answer is yes. Capito\u2019s office pointed us to data from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019 nonpartisan arbiter of budget figures. As the measure was being considered, CBO released a cost estimate for the section of the bill that falls under the jurisdiction of the House Education and Labor Committee. The CBO estimate counts almost $129 billion of funding in the bill as falling under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund. This accounts for the vast bulk of K-12 education spending in the measure. (Higher education funding is also included in the bill, but Capito\u2019s remarks dealt with K-12 schools.) Here\u2019s a year-by-year breakdown of when that roughly $129 billion will be spent: As the chart shows, some money will be spent on K-12 education every year between 2021 and 2028. It\u2019s worth noting that relatively little money will be spent as far out as 2028: Less than 1% of the total spending is scheduled to occur in 2028 itself, and collectively, the years 2026 through 2028 will account for only 10% of the spending. The bulk of the money, about 60%, is to be spent in the middle three years \u2014 2023, 2024, and 2025. About 30% would be spent in 2021 and 2022. (The 2021 fiscal year, which roughly overlaps with the 2020-2021 school year, is already underway. That helps explain the small amount allotted for 2021.) In other words, only about one-third of the money would be spent relatively quickly, supporting Capito\u2019s point. Relatively little money would be spent as late as 2028, but she is correct that some will be. Capito said that the American Relief Plan \"has a lot of money in it for schools, but if you really look at it \u2026 it says that the school money is going to go out until the year 2028. This is supposed to be an emergency bill.\" She is correct that spending on K-12 education will continue through 2028, though 90% will be spent between now and 2025. Her statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",

        "claim": "A new study shows hydroxychloroquine can increase Covid-19 survival rates by 200%.",
        "doc": "An article on MailOnline and several Facebook posts have claimed that a new study shows that hydroxychloroquine \"can increase COVID survival rates by 200%\". This is not as promising as it sounds, because the study in question , which has not yet been peer-reviewed , is flawed. The paper looked at 255 Covid-19 patients in a hospital in New Jersey, who were at some point given invasive mechanical ventilation , where a tube is inserted into the patient's airway in order to get air into their lungs. Dr Penny Ward, Visiting Professor in Pharmaceutical Medicine at King's College London explains, via the Science Media Centre , that 88% of the 255 people received at least some hydroxychloroquine, and a majority also were given azithromycin. From that, the researchers assessed how much both contributed to their survival according to how much of these drugs the patients were given overall. Out of the 255, 37 patients were given a combination of the highest cumulative doses of hydroxychloroquine (that is, over the course of their whole treatment) and an antibiotic called azithromycin . Of this group, 18 survived, which is just under half. Dr Ward says: \"This is a flawed analysis...because the small number of survivors are likely to have received treatment for a longer period than individuals dying rapidly despite [invasive mechanical ventilation] and [it] thereby potentially favours survivors. \"This analysis is flawed as longer survival is likely to be associated with greater cumulative doses of any treatments given and in addition there is a major imbalance between the numbers of individuals in each group compared.\" In other words, patients may have been given more of these drugs simply because they lived longer, so the study doesn't necessarily mean that the drugs prolonged their lives. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in This study does not prove that hydroxychloroquine works Dr Jeffrey Aronson, Consultant Physician and Clinical Pharmacologist at the University of Oxford told Full Fact via the Science Media Centre: \"This was a small, non-randomized, retrospective, observational study, of a kind that would not be taken as good evidence, even if we did not already have strong evidence from large, well-designed, randomized studies that hydroxychloroquine is not only not beneficial in Covid-19, but may even be harmful, especially if combined with azithromycin.\" As Dr Aronson says, this paper is observational , meaning that the researchers didn't intervene (i.e. purposely give one group a treatment and not the other). The best evidence for proving that a treatment works comes from randomised double blind trials , where neither the patients nor the doctors know whether they are getting a potential medication, or are in the 'control' group without it. Patients in each group are also chosen so each group is similar as possible, to prevent other factors affecting their outcomes. Last week, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) suspended recruitment to any clinical trials that were investigating whether hydroxychloroquine might treat or prevent Covid-19. This followed results from a large-scale UK trial , which found \"no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19\". Where did the 200% come from? Of the 37 patients who were given the most hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, just under half survived. In comparison, 16.5% of the 218 other patients who didn't receive as much of the drugs survived. The paper reports that the relative difference in survival between these groups was 198% . This doesn't mean any Covid-19 patient is 200% more (or three times as) likely to survive given this combination of medication. It means the survival rate in the very small group given this treatment was quite a lot higher than in the rest of the patients in this study.",

        "claim": "A Homeland Security study \"showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security.\"",
        "doc": "Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said his state won\u2019t tolerate sanctuary cities and cited as backup a federal report, claiming it found that more than 100 murders could have been prevented if communities worked with immigration officers. \"Sanctuary city\" is a term commonly used for a jurisdiction that limits its cooperation with immigration authorities. Federal officials send requests to local jails asking them to hold individuals scheduled for release so that immigration officers can pick them up. The extent of cooperation and scope of the policies implemented vary by jurisdiction. Cagle, who is running for governor, told a local news station that the City of Decatur may be in violation of a state law prohibiting sanctuary cities. \"How are they in direct violation?\" WSB-TV\u2019s Craig Lucie asked Cagle. (Decatur said it complies with state law and called the sanctuary city label a misunderstanding.) \"Well, they are not cooperating with (U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement), and the important feature of this is that criminal illegal aliens, it was demonstrated with a Homeland Security study, that showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security,\" Cagle said Oct. 9. President Donald Trump has claimed that sanctuary cities attract criminals and blamed their policies for the killings of Americans by immigrants in the country illegally. Given the national debate about sanctuary cities, we wondered if Cagle was right that the Department of Homeland Security had determined that 120 murders might not have happened if communities cooperated with immigration authorities. We found that DHS has not done a study on this issue. Cagle\u2019s office pointed us to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which said that according to ICE data, \"up to 121 homicides in the U.S. could have been avoided\" between fiscal years 2010 and 2014 if ICE had deported criminal immigrants instead of releasing them back into the United States. But that letter is not about sanctuary cities\u2019 lack of cooperation with ICE. David Lapan, spokesman for DHS, told PolitiFact that neither DHS or ICE had published a report showing that murders could have been prevented in communities if they complied with immigration authorities. \"However, there are instances where criminal aliens who were released from jails -- without allowing ICE to take custody -- who then went on to commit additional crimes, including murder,\" Lapan said. But information provided by Cagle\u2019s office did not support the claim that 120 murders took place due to sanctuary city policies. A June 12, 2015, letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then Sen. Jeff Sessions, who chaired the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, specified that 121 criminal immigrants were charged with homicide after their release from ICE custody from fiscal years 2010 and 2014. Of the 121 individuals released by ICE: \u2022 33 were released on a bond set by the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review; \u2022 24 were released because a 2001 Supreme Court case, Zadvydas vs. Davis, prevents the indefinite detention of immigrants who can\u2019t be deported (some countries won\u2019t take back their nationals ordered removed); \u2022 64 were released per ICE\u2019s discretion. The letter does not say that the homicides for which the 121 individuals were charged could have been prevented if communities or sanctuary cities had cooperated with ICE. It centered on ICE\u2019s release of the immigrants from their custody. The senators asked DHS, the State Department and the Attorney General to identify the jurisdictions to which the 121 criminal immigrants were released. A June 16, 2015, letter sent to ICE\u2019s assistant secretary doesn\u2019t cite a specific number of homicides that could have been avoided, but more broadly said 121 criminals who were not deported were charged with homicides after their release from ICE custody between fiscal years 2010 and 2014. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels, reviewed data related to the 121 criminal immigrants. \"This tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due to Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes only those aliens that ICE arrested and then released,\" the center reported in March 2016. Cagle\u2019s overarching message is that homicides could have been prevented if criminal immigrants were deported, his office said. \"The safety and security of every Georgian has been, and always will be, the top priority of Lt. Gov. Cagle,\" said Bo Butler, Cagle\u2019s chief of staff. \"The point in referencing this shocking number of murders is that Homeland Security concluded at least 121 homicides were committed by convicted criminal illegal aliens. Had deportation occurred following the previous convictions, this loss of life could have been prevented.\" Cagle said that a Homeland Security study \"showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security.\" Many elements of this statement are wrong. DHS said it had not published such a report. Cagle\u2019s office actually referred to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing ICE data, that said up to 121 homicides could have been avoided if ICE had deported criminal immigrants. While the letter started off saying 121 homicides were preventable, the document focuses on 121 being the number of criminal immigrants who were charged with homicide after being released by ICE. Most importantly, while homicides were committed, the letter does not claim they could have been avoided had sanctuary policies not been in place. Cagle\u2019s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",

In Minnesota, the budgets follow fiscal years that begin in July. So the first budget Pawlenty could have put his stamp on was the 2004 budget that went into effect on July 1, 2003.We found spending numbers dating back to 1960, and averaged the two-year increases for the general fund between 1965 and 2003. We arrived at 21.09 percent, so that\u2019s in line with what Pawlenty said.We then turned to the second part of Pawlenty\u2019s statement, that \"we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\" First, note that he\u2019s comparing two-year increments with one-year increments, which would make the difference seem more dramatic.Still, we examined year-over-year change from 2004 to 2011. (Again, Pawlenty left office on Jan. 3, 2011, but the fiscal year started six months before that.)We averaged the year-to-year changes in the budget for those years and arrived at an average increase of 1.64 percent, very close to what Pawlenty said. If you took the two-year average, it would be a bit higher, at 3.53 percent.Yet those numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story.As Pawlenty was leaving office, state budget agency released forecasts showing spending increasing 27 percent over the next two years -- before the incoming governor, Democrat Mark Dayton, made any changes to the budget at all.The budget analysts said the state had used several mechanisms to reduce state spending. That included using $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate delays shifts in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion.The budget numbers led DFLers -- that\u2019s members of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, equivalent to Democrats in other states -- to blame Pawlenty for using one-time fixes and ignoring structural imbalances.Pawlenty supporters acknowledged the anticipated spending increase but blamed it on DFLers for refusing to embrace Pawlenty\u2019s ideas for long-term solutions.Pawlenty\u2019s statement was that from 1960 to 2003, \"the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent. \u2026 we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\" The numbers are accurate, though Pawlenty is comparing two-year increases to one-year increases. More significantly, spending forecasts increased dramatically as Pawlenty was leaving office, when short-term budget fixes like the federal stimulus and spending delays for K-12 education expired. Given that increase, we rate his statement Half True.",

Later that day, a claim started to spread on social media that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had bought millions of shares of cannabis stock before Biden\u2019s announcement. \"Breaking,\" reads one Oct. 7 Instagram post. \"Nancy Pelosi purchased 10,000,000 shares of $WEED 4 days ago.\" The claim was attributed to Reuters, a news service headquartered in London. \"Imagine that\u2026 #crooks,\" the post added. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Reuters said in an Oct. 13 story about the claim that it did not report this. We found no evidence to contradict this. Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, told PolitiFact the claim is false. Pelosi\u2019s most recent publicly available financial disclosure report, signed by the speaker Oct. 14, reflects no such transaction. Nor did the previous report, signed Sept. 9, or any others filed this year. Stock purchases by politicians and their potential for conflicts of interest have drawn increased scrutiny in recent years. And in December, Pelosi drew some criticism for rebuffing the idea of banning congressional lawmakers and their spouses from owning individual shares. But claims that she bought shares of cannabis stock this year \u2014 and that Reuters reported on it \u2014 are False.",

This claim is false. Lung Cleaner Tritydo is not an FDA-registered product. Also known as Bo Phoi Tritydo, this drug has not been endorsed by any local health organization or health agencies in the Philippines or the United States as a treatment for respiratory ailments. Part of the FB post accompanying the video reads: \u201cTreatment of Asthma \u2013 Pneumonia \u2013 Bronchitis, no need to go to the hospital, treat it at home.\u201d It further claims, without proof, that it can protect against COVID-19, Rappler has debunked a similar false claim. The FDA flagged Lung Cleaner Tritydo as an unregistered food supplement in 2020. The manufacture, importation or exportation, sale, or distribution of unregistered products is prohibited under the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009. The Department of Health (DOH) has not endorsed the drug as a remedy for bronchitis. There is no cure for asthma, but asthma attacks can be controlled through medication, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the DOH. The Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) recommends the use of antibiotics, not Lung Cleaner Tritydo, in treating pneumonia. Pneumonia is a type of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection treated by antibiotics, the U.S. CDC stated. Bronchitis is the swelling of lung airways (called bronchi) caused by exposure to pollutants, viruses, or bacteria, while asthma is a chronic lung disease caused by inflamed, swollen, and narrow airways, the DOH explained.

        "claim": "Says Sen. Mark Begich is ineffective because he has only \"passed one bill, the naming of a building.\"",
        "doc": "Dan Sullivan, the Republican Senate candidate in Alaska, is charging that his opponent, Sen. Mark Begich, is an ineffective lawmaker compared to other Alaska senators. According to a recent Sullivan campaign mailer, Begich -- who has been in office since 2009 -- has passed zero pieces of legislation during his first term. The Sullivan campaign reinforced this line of attack in a Facebook meme that said Begich has passed one bill, and all it did was name a building. This meme compared Begich\u2019s record to that of other Alaska senators, saying that Begich\u2019s predecessor, the late Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, passed 13 bills during his first term in the chamber, and that current Sen. Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, passed five during her first term. We wondered: Did only one of Begich's bills pass during his first term? And is that the only way to measure his effectiveness as a legislator? We searched the Congressional Quarterly congressional database and found that since becoming a senator in 2009, Sen. Begich has only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and that bill was to name an Alaska courthouse. So Sullivan has a point. But it\u2019s a point that should be taken with a grain of salt. First, the claim has quickly become outdated. Last week -- after the mailer and meme first appeared -- the Senate and House passed a Begich-sponsored bill to increase veterans\u2019 disability compensation that President Barack Obama is expected to sign into law. Second, counting the number of passed bills sponsored by a lawmaker is not the only -- or even the best -- way to gauge their effectiveness. In reality, there are many ways for a member of Congress to get desired legislation to the president\u2019s desk beyond being the bill\u2019s chief sponsor, said Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \"There are some lawmakers who sponsor or cosponsor a lot of bills, but it doesn't reflect much of anything,\" he said, adding that the name on a bill that passes may be more of a reflection of who chaired the committee of jurisdiction rather than the member who actually drove the bill. Begich has co-sponsored 37 bills that became law. For seven of these laws, he was one of five or fewerco-sponsors, meaning he likely would have had tangible influence over the bill. And on three of these, Begich was the sole cosponsor of bills put forward by Murkowski, his fellow Alaska senator. All three dealt with Alaska-specific issues, such as Denali National Park. Meanwhile, a lawmaker\u2019s name doesn\u2019t have to be on a bill to accomplish legislative goals. Here are a few examples for Begich: \u2022 The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012 included a provision authored by Begich that explored the possibility of a deep-water port in the Arctic. Begich didn\u2019t sponsor or co-sponsor that bill, which originated in the House, but he did sponsor the corresponding Senate version. \u2022 In a previous fact-check, we found that Begich had played a key role in getting Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling for the first time in decades. A lawyer involved with the efforts told PolitiFact at the time that Begich\u2019s \"biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying \u2018Dammit, we need to get this done.\u2019 \" \u2022 In 2012, Alaska Native tribal health programs signed an agreement with the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs that allowed Alaska Native veterans to receive medical care in tribal areas, rather than having to travel to Anchorage or Seattle. The Alaska Army National Guard and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium both said Begich supported that effort. \u2022 In the 2009 economic stimulus package, Begich fought for funds that benefited Alaska military bases and that helped build a hospital in Nome, Alaska, McClatchy reported. Additionally, Begich heads the Senate\u2019s Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, which has responsibilities beyond passing legislation, including improving the party\u2019s relationship with traditionally Republican constituencies, according to his profile in Congressional Quarterly. So simply looking at the number of Begich-sponsored bills signed into law doesn\u2019t give a full sense of his activities in the Senate. It\u2019s also worth remembering that partisan gridlock has meant that a historically low number of bills are passing these days, meaning fewer opportunities for Begich -- or anyone else -- to get their names on a signed bill. As of July, about 800 bills have become law since Begich took office in 2009, according to compiled GovTrack data. If every member of Congress were to pass the same number of bills, that would break down to about 1.5bills per person over the 5.5-year period. It was much different in Stevens\u2019 first term, which ran from 1969 to 1974. Congress passed nearly 800 bills between 1973 and 1974 alone. (We don\u2019t have data back further than that.) That breaks down to about 1.5bills per person in just two years. Our ruling Sullivan said Begich is ineffective because he has passed only \"one bill, the naming of a building.\" Technically, Sullivan has a point -- at the time Sullivan\u2019s post went up, Begich had only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and it named a courthouse. Another Begich-sponsored bill concerning veterans\u2019 issues subsequently passed both the House and Senate. However, this is an oversimplification, since Begich has had success pushing a legislative agenda in ways that don\u2019t end up with his name on an enacted bill. Notably, Begich has been one of a small number of co-sponsors on bills that have passed, and legislative language he sponsored has ended up enacted in bills with someone else\u2019s name on it. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",

Tarzan is a fictional character, an orphan raised in the jungle by gorillas, who first appeared in Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1914 and later in several movies. But Facebook's fact-checking system has flagged the graphic as possibly false. Who is the man, and what is his story? Fled as one-year-old after US troops bombed village A TinEye reverse image search of the photos led us to several news articles , a book , a website and a YouTube documentary about Ho Van Lang, a North Vietnamese man who lived in the jungle for 41 years. In 1972 the man, then just a year old, fled with his father Ho Van Thanh into the woods of North Vietnam 's Tra Bong district after US troops bombed their village during the Vietnam War , killing half their family. In 2013 they were rescued after 41 years when the father became ill. 'My father didn't explain that to me' The book and documentary are by Alvaro Cerezo , who befriended Ho Van Lang. \"In 2013 the world was amazed by the news that an old man and his son had been 'rescued' from the Vietnam jungle, after having lived there totally isolated from the civilian world during 41 long years,\" the documentary's description reads. \"The son's name is Ho Van Lang and he grew up oblivious to the rest of the human race, not having even the most basic data on 'man'.\" It adds : \"At 42 years old Lang never knew the existence of the female sex as his father never told him. More surprising still is that today, now being able to distinguish between men and women, he still doesn't know the essential difference between them.\" In the documentary, an interpreter asks him : \"Do you know what a female is?\" \"My father didn't explain that to me,\" he responds. After the interpreter then asks \"Did you discover the difference between male and female?\" he again answers \"My father didn't explain that to me.\" Ho Van Lang died of liver cancer in September 2021, aged 52. In an obituary, the New York Post writes that while his father \"had maintained some of his language skills\", Lang \"could speak only a few words of the regional Cor language\".",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence to support the conspiracy theory that Walmart is kidnapping children or selling kids on its website. A Walmart spokesperson dismissed it. The claim relates to items on Walmart Marketplace, a part of Walmart.com where outside sellers offer goods. Marketplace sellers manage their own inventory, pricing, order-fulfillment and customer service, but they sell through Walmart.com. \"Our investigations team looked into each of these items and contacted the sellers, and they appear to be simple errors by legitimate marketplace sellers,\" the Walmart spokesperson said. \"Any allegation to the contrary is simply untrue.\" The Sam Edelman Jaina New Nude Baby Leopard Brahma Hair heels from the video are now listed at $77.97, instead of $5,000. This is not the first time claims surrounding Walmart and child trafficking have been debunked by fact-checking outlets. And a similar human trafficking hoax about Wayfair went viral and was repeatedly debunked last July. Child sex trafficking claims have garnered support and been amplified by followers of the QAnon and Pizzagate conspiracy theories several times over the past few years. Social media posts claim that Walmart is \"kidnapping kids\" and selling them on Walmart.com under the guise of high-priced shoes. There is no evidence to support these claims. A Walmart spokesperson denied the allegations and said an investigation into the items in question revealed the prices that raised concern appeared to be \"simple errors.\" We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",

The BJP government published an infographic on the 48-months portal that makes 3 claims about labour welfare under the present government. This article is a fact check of the claims. Has minimum wage increased by 42%? The first claim is that \u2018Minimum wage increased by 42%, directly benefiting 55 lakh workers\u2019. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states that \u2018the employment sector in India poses great challenge in terms of its structure which is dominated by informal workers, high levels of under employment, skill shortages and labour markets with rigid labour laws and institutions. In this context, the Government has undertaken the exercise of rationalization of the 38 Labour Acts by clubbing them into 4 labour codes viz Code on Wages, Code on Industrial Relations, Code on Social Security and Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working conditions\u2019. This is still work in progress as the relevant bill has not been passed by the Parliament. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Labour and Employment states that \u2018by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing, the relevant provisions of the minimum wages Act, 1948, the payment of bonus Act, 1965 and the equal remuneration Act, 1976. The draft code on wages bill, 2017 has been introduced in the Lok Sabha in August 2017 and referred to standing committee on labour\u2019. The report also states that \u2018the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 was enacted to safeguard the interests of the workers mostly in the unorganised sector. Under the provision of the Act, both the Central Government and State Governments are the appropriate governments to fix, revise, review and enforce the payment of minimum wages to workers in respect of scheduled employments under their respective jurisdictions. There are 45 scheduled employments in the Central Sphere and as many as 1709 in the State Sphere. The enforcement of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is ensured at two levels. While in the Central Sphere, the enforcement is done through the Inspecting officers of the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) commonly designated as Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM), the compliance in the State Sphere is ensured through the State Enforcement Machinery\u2019. A response in Lok Sabha states that \u2018according to the provisions contained in the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the appropriate Government revises the minimum wages in all the scheduled employments under its jurisdiction at an interval not exceeding five years. Recently, Central Government has revised the basic minimum wages in January 2017 for Agriculture, Construction, Non-Coal Mines, Stone-Mines, Sweeping and Cleaning, Watch & Ward and Loading/ Unloading, after consultation with the Minimum Wages Advisory Board. However, in the Central sphere, wages are revised on half yearly basis effective from 1st April and 1st October every year by addition of Variable Dearness Allowance\u2019. What this essentially means is that the central government can only revise minimum wages for employment under its jurisdiction. It cannot exercise control or revise minimum wages of any employments under the jurisdiction of the respective state government. The following table shows the differences between the last revised minimum wages of the UPA and the latest one of the BJP government. The comparison is for the semi-skilled (skilled workers are taken where the category is not existing) in A category places including the variable dearness allowance (VDA). Employment Type 2014 2018 Agriculture 235 389 Construction 363 617 Non-Coal Mines 273 466 Sweeping and Cleaning 329 558 Watch & Ward 363 679 Loading/ Unloading 329 558 While the central government exercises control over the eight sectors mentioned above, the states are responsible for a lot more. For example, in the state of Telangana , the Government of Telangana have fixed minimum rates of wages in (73) Scheduled employments under Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in which 65 employments (industry related) are covered under part-I and 8 (Agriculture related) Scheduled employments under part-II of the said Act. Presently, the wages have been fixed to each and every category under the above specific employments and as a result wages are fixed covering nearly for 20 to 40 categories of workers in each employment\u2019. While this points to the fact that the claim itself is misleading, in the budget speech of 2019-20, the finance minister stated that \u2018during the last five years, the minimum wages of labourers of the all categories have been increased by 42%, which is the highest ever\u2019. Finally, it can be said that the minimum wages for sectors under the central sphere have increased by varying amounts where as the claim makes a blanket statement about minimum wages having increased across the board. On the other hand, there is no publicly available data on how many people have actually benefitted from this revision in the central sector. Claim: Minimum wage increased by 42%, directly benefiting 55 lakh workers. Fact: Firstly, the central government has very limited jurisdiction to determine wages (as compared to state governments) since only a few sectors are under in the central sector. Secondly, no comprehensive data is available to verify how many people have benefitted from the increase in wages. Hence the claim is MISLEADING. How many people benefitted from the seventh pay commission? The second claim is that \u2018Seventh pay commission benefitted 50 lakh employees and 35 lakh pensioners\u2019. The report of the Seventh Pay Commission states that \u2018the Government of India has also, from time to time, set up various Pay Commissions for improving the pay structure of its employees so that they can attract better talent to public service. In this 21st century, the global economy has undergone a vast change and it has seriously impacted the living conditions of the salaried class. The economic value of the salaries paid to them earlier has diminished. The economy has become more and more consumer economy. Therefore, to keep the salary structure of the employees viable, it has become necessary to improve the pay structure of their employees so that better, more competent and talented people could be attracted for governance\u2019. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states that \u2018the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission in respect of Central Government employees, Armed Forces personnel, Members of All India Services, etc. which were submitted to the Government on 19th November, 2015, were accepted by the Government in respect of matters pertaining to pay and pension in July, 2016. The decision of the Government in regard to the recommendations pertaining to pay and pension entailed an additional financial implication of Rs. 84,933 crores in the year 2016-17\u2019. The same report goes on to describe that \u2018the decisions of the Government on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission benefited over 1 crore Central Government employees, including Armed Forces personnel and Members of All India Services, comprising approximately 53 lakh pensioners including Armed Forces personnel\u2019. Hence the numbers reported by the ministry in their annual report are far higher than the numbers in the claim. However, pay commissions are setup on a regular basis and till date, seven pay commissions have been set up to review and make recommendations on the work and pay structure of the central government employees and the army personnel. Claim: Seventh pay commission benefitted 50 lakh employees and 35 lakh pensioners. Fact: The decisions of the Government on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission benefited over 1 crore Central Government employees and Members of All India Services, comprising approximately 53 lakh pensioners including the armed forces personnel. The numbers are far higher than the claim because of the inclusion of the armed forces personnel. Hence the claim is TRUE. However, pay commissions are setup on a regular basis and till date, seven pay commissions have been set up to review and make recommendations on the work and pay structure of the central government employees and the army personnel. What is the government\u2019s contribution to EPF? The third claim is that \u2018contribution of 12% to EPF for new employees for 3 years by the government in sectors employing large number of people\u2019. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Labour and Employment details that the employees provident fund organization (EPFO) is \u2018reposnsible for administration of the employees provident funds and miscellaneous provisions Act, 1952. The schemes for provident fund, family pension and deposit linked insurance are implemented by the organization for the benefit of workers covered under the scheme. The organization is also responsible for administration of employees\u2019 pension scheme, 1995\u2019. The Employees\u2019 Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, after the latest amendment states that \u2018the contribution which shall be paid by the employer to the fund shall be 10% of the basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, if any, for the time being payable to each of the employees whether employed by him directly or by or through a contractor, and the employee\u2019s contribution shall be equal to the contribution payable by the employer in respect of him and may, if any employee so desires, be an amount exceeding ten percent of his basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining allowance if any, subject to the condition that the employer shall not be under an obligation to pay any contribution over and above his contribution payable under this section\u2019. The scheme document of the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana states that \u2018in the Budget Speech 2016-17, it was stated that in order to incentivize creation of new jobs in the formal sector, Government of India will pay the Employee Pension Scheme contribution of 8.33% for all new employees enrolling in EPFO for the first three years of their employment. This will incentivize the employers to recruit unemployed persons and also to bring into the books the informal employees. In order to channelize this intervention towards the target group of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, the scheme will be applicable to those with salary up to Rs 15,000 per month. I have made a budget provision of Rs 1,000 crore for this scheme\u2019. The scheme has been amended in April 2018, where the government will pay the full employer\u2019s contribution (both EPF & EPS). Claim: Contribution of 12% to EPF for new employees for 3 years by the government in sectors employing large number of people. Fact: Government of India will pay the full employer\u2019s contribution (both EPF & EPS) of 12%. Hence, the claim is TRUE.

        "doc": "\"Fury as council spends \u00a3180,000 renaming Black Boy Lane in north London 'La Rose Lane' in aftermath of BLM protests due to 'racial connotations'\" MailOnline, 23 January 2023 . \"Black Boy Lane renamed because it's 'racist' at cost of '\u00a3186k' but new road signs still bear the offensive name\" LBC, 23 January 2023 . A street in south Tottenham, London, which was formerly known as \"Black Boy Lane\" has been renamed \"La Rose Lane\" due to concerns about the old name's \"racist connotations\". Over the last few days, we've seen varying claims about exactly how much the council has spent or will spend on renaming the road. MailOnline reported the council is spending \u00a3180,000, LBC said it was reportedly \u00a3186,000 and some have claimed it cost \u00a3189,000. The local council has now said the cost is unlikely to exceed \u00a3100,000. MailOnline changed its headline to \"Fury as council spends '\u00a3100,000'\", and updated its article with a note explaining the changes, after Full Fact contacted it for comment. Stay informed Be first in line for the facts \u2013 get our free weekly email Subscribe Updated costs The figures which have been widely circulated appear to have originated from a 2021 Haringey Council document which estimated the costs would come to \u00a3186,000. However, Haringey Council told Full Fact that this number was a two-year-old upper estimate of the total cost that could be required, and that actually, it was now highly unlikely to exceed \u00a3100,000. Councillor Peray Ahmet said: \"I want to be clear that this [more than \u00a3180,000] figure was an upper estimate of the total cost that could be required two years ago. In reality the cost has been significantly lower than this. \"The vast majority of the funds that have been set aside for this project is for the voluntary payments of \u00a3300 per household which we are making to residents of La Rose Lane in recognition of the inconvenience that the name change may cause. The final cost will depend on how many residents opt to take up this offer, but is highly unlikely to exceed \u00a3100,000.\" The original 2021 estimate was made up of the following costs: \u00a375,000 for \"resident/organisation payment of \u00a3300 per household/organisation for 183 registered property addresses on Black Boy Lane, with contingency up to 250\" \u00a350,000 for \"support and administration officer equivalent FTE [full-time equivalent] grade PO1 (TBC), assuming top of grade including on-costs for maximum 1 year, figure provided is estimated maximum\" \u00a350,000 for \"legal advice / 1 to 1 support to residents / organisations for their particular circumstances\" \u00a35,000 for \"letters and postage\" \u00a35,000 for \"replacing x4 street name plates, assume double cost for 'formerly Black Boy Lane' removal also \u00a3600 x 4 x2 rounded up\" \u00a31,000 for \"bus stop changes (Transport for London) \u00a3500 x2 bus stops\" We don't have a breakdown of what costs are now expected to be, so don't know which of these costs are still likely to be incurred, other than the inconvenience payments which will still be offered. Where did the claim come from? The MailOnline article ( since amended ) previously said \"heritage campaigners, Save Our Statues, alleged that the name change has cost Haringey Council \u00a3180,000 of public money\" and said it had approached Haringey Council about the alleged cost of the renaming. The BBC also credited Save Our Statues with the figure, saying: \"According to campaign group Save Our Statues, the new sign cost the council about \u00a3186,000. It declined to comment on whether this figure was accurate.\" Save Our Statues did tweet on 23 January about the name change, saying: \"Thank goodness @SadiqKhan and @haringeycouncil are there with \u00a3180,000 of public money to step in\". However, the account owner told Full Fact his tweet had only been quoting a figure reported in the Daily Mail from March 2021. MailOnline did use the \u00a3186,000 figure in March 2021 , around the time it was produced by Haringey Council. Meanwhile LBC published an article on 23 January 2023 with the headline \"Black Boy Lane renamed because it's 'racist' at cost of '\u00a3186k' but new road signs still bear the offensive name\". Later in the article it said \"the move caused a backlash among some locals after it was reported that the change in names had cost taxpayers \u00a3186,000\" but did not name a source. We approached LBC for comment. However, it also published an article using the figure in October 2021 , which correctly sourced the figure to \"documents produced for Haringey Council earlier this year\". Journalist Emily Carver tweeted asking if the name change was a \"good use of \u00a3189,000\", a figure since repeated on Facebook , but Ms Carver told Full Fact the figure was just a typo and she meant to write \u00a3186,000.",

        "doc": "Gift Article Share \u201cA study shows that corn, soybean and wheat farmers across the U.S. have already lost $13 billion because of the administration\u2019s trade war. We need trade policies that make sense for North Dakota, protect farmers and ranchers, and open up markets.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), in a tweet, on July 24 \u201cFarmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries.\u201d \u2014 President Trump, in a tweet, on July 20 Hours after President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods took effect July 6, China retaliated, leveling equivalent tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods \u2014 including agricultural products. The tariffs and China\u2019s reaction have sparked a political debate. Trump has proclaimed that \u201ctariffs are the greatest!\u201d Vulnerable Democrats running for reelection in red states aren\u2019t as enthusiastic. They argue that farmers \u2014 especially soybean farmers \u2014 are the first victims of the administration\u2019s trade war. Trump says Europe will pick up the slack in demand. Plus, he contends, the tariffs were a necessary adjustment, claiming that incomes and commodity prices were falling well before he took office. Advertisement We previously looked into the president\u2019s tweet, but the two starkly different assessments caught our attention, and we thought a closer look was in order. After all, how can the president\u2019s tariffs be both savior and disaster? The Facts Prices for agricultural products are shaped by a plethora of forces, including the number of plantings, global trends, weather and what happened the year before. U.S. agriculture experienced a \u201cgolden period\u201d from 2011 to 2014, according to Mary Marchant, a professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics. She pointed out that supply and demand lined up in favor of U.S. agriculture during those years, producing big profits. Farm income began to decline in 2013 (not 2003 as Trump suggests), and the decline continued through 2016 as \u201cincreased plantings, combined with good weather, led to record U.S. farm production.\u201d In other words, there was more supply than demand. Advertisement With that importance of supply and demand in mind, let\u2019s examine the tweet from Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). She claimed that \u201ca study shows that corn, soybean and wheat farmers across the U.S. have already lost $13 billion because of the administration\u2019s trade war.\u201d When the Fact Checker asked to see the study, Heitkamp\u2019s office pointed us to an op-ed from the National Farmers Union that was referenced in a New York Times article. But the National Farmers Union said the calculation was not its work. Instead, it said, it obtained the factoid from a quote in an article in the Wall Street Journal. Christopher Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, is quoted as saying that \u201cthe total value of this year\u2019s U.S. corn, soybean and wheat crops dropped about $13 billion, or 10 percent, in June.\u201d Aha! That\u2019s the source of the mysterious $13 billion figure. But it was not exactly \u201ca study,\u201d simply a quote. Advertisement Hurt told The Fact Checker that he calculated this figure by multiplying the estimated production for 2018 crops by the change in daily futures prices for each of the commodities from June 1 to a given date. That means his estimate changes every day, on the basis of what price a crop would fetch on the harvest date, not right now. By the time Heitkamp cited Hurt\u2019s $13 billion figure, almost a month later, futures for soybeans, corn and wheat were lower. Their value had dropped an additional $1.5 billion to roughly $14.56 billion July 24, according to Hurt. The volatility is particularly clear when you fast-forward to Aug. 8. On that day, Hurt pegged a $9 billion decline in corn, soybean and wheat crops. In other words, the situation had improved almost 40 percent in just two weeks. Hurt explained that the shift was partly brought on by drought concerns in the United States and other parts of the world, but he cautioned that \u201csorting out the impacts of weather from tariffs is not immediately obvious.\u201d To do so, he said, would require making assumptions that were not part of his calculation. Advertisement Moreover, Hurt made these estimates using the commodities futures markets. Olga Isengildina Massa, a commodity markets expert at Virginia Tech, said these markets represent what soybeans, corn and wheat would sell for after harvest, which in some cases is months away. She added that these futures do not immediately affect all farmers. Many farmers set a fixed price for their crops before the growing season and so avoid the market\u2019s whims. All of that means these projections shouldn\u2019t be considered a value that has been \u201calready lost,\u201d as Heitkamp says. Meanwhile, despite the recent plunge in commodities, soybean prices still have not dropped \u201c50% since 5 years before the Election,\u201d as Trump claimed. In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In June 2018, soybeans cost $9.55 per bushel. That\u2019s a 29 percent drop. Looking at yearly averages, even the lowest projection for the 2018-2019 year still doesn\u2019t justify the president\u2019s claim. Advertisement Agricultural trade agreements have been \u201crelatively stable during the past 10 years,\u201d Hurt reminded us. While changes to the agreements might have \u201chelped cushion the magnitude of the price drop\u201d that started in 2013, there\u2019s little evidence that \u201cbad (terrible) Trade Deals\u201d were the primary cause of the decline in commodity prices. Marchant echoed this conclusion, saying: \u201cThe bottom line is trade has been good for agriculture overall, and we are dependent on it for our success.\u201d The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Heitkamp\u2019s office deleted her tweet after our inquiries. \u201cEvery day, Sen. Heitkamp hears serious concerns from North Dakota farmers about how the administration\u2019s trade policies are hurting their bottom lines,\u201d Abigail McDonough, her communications director, said in a statement to The Fact Checker. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to end the escalating trade war so American farmers have access to markets to sell their goods, and can support their families and our local economies.\u201d Pinocchio Test The agricultural commodities market is a complicated balance of supply and demand that politicians seem intent on glossing over. Advertisement Farm income has been in decline since 2013 \u2014 not 2003, as Trump stated. But the fall was started by good weather, not bad trade agreements. Since then, soybean prices have plunged by 29 percent \u2014 not 50 percent, as the president claimed. There is ample evidence of U.S. agriculture\u2019s struggle, but Trump is manipulating the numbers to prove an inaccurate point. Trump earns Three Pinocchios Meanwhile, Heitkamp also neglects the nuances of the agricultural market by pinning the blame on one factor \u2014 albeit probably large \u2014 in the collapse of the commodity prices. There is little doubt that the administration\u2019s trade policies and tariffs have had a negative effect, but by citing an ever-changing estimate as a study, she creates a false impression that the consequences are fixed. The future may look bleak, but it\u2019s still too soon to know the full impact. Advertisement We struggled between One and Two Pinocchios, but the misrepresentation of the underlying economics pushed us to Two. Coming from a farm state, Heitkamp should be careful in referring to what has been \u201calready lost.\u201d It\u2019s good that she deleted her tweet, but she would have more credibility if she had deleted it with an acknowledgement of her error.

        "claim": "Photo is evidence from NASA that proves the Moon was once split in two",
        "doc": "A collage of four photos has been shared more than 260 times since it was uploaded on an Islamic page on Facebook here on August 5, 2019. The photo is titled: \"The Miracle of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him) 'Splitting of the Moon'\". One picture in the collage shows the Moon's surface, with an arrow pointing to a purported crack seen on the Moon. Text superimposed on the picture reads: \"This is the location of the split that extends across the length of the moon.\" The post's caption reads: \"The Qur'an says...The hour has come near, and the moon has split [in two].... \"This miracle was also proved by NASA..{ Qura'n & science }\". The second photo in the collage shows American astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr. of Apollo 11, the first lunar mission that landed humans on the Moon in July 1969. The third photo shows two half Moons; and the last picture shows the full Moon. The claim -- circulating online among Muslim Internet users from various countries such as Indonesia and Pakistan for years -- refers to the story of a miracle performed by the Prophet Mohammed, which is derived from Chapter 54 Verse 1 of the Koran. The same photo collage has been shared more than 15,700 times after it appeared on Islamic pages on Facebook here, here, here, here and here. The posts, which were still reposted as recently as April 2022, claim that the photo of \"the Moon's crack line\" was taken from Apollo 10 and Apollo 11. That picture also circulated alongside a similar claim in Indonesian, such as in this Facebook post and in this YouTube video, which has been garnered more than 5.4 million views. But the claim is false. Reverse image searches trace the source of the photo to the website of US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which published the picture in 2002. NASA said the photo, taken by the Apollo 10 crew in May 1969, shows Rima Ariadaeus -- a long rille or lunar trench. As explained by NASA here, \"rilles, such as Rima Ariadaeus, are believed to be faults that formed as a result of tectonic activity. Some scientists believe that the linear rilles might have formed after large impact events, while others believe that the rilles were formed as a surface manifestation of deep-seated dike systems when the moon was still volcanically active. \"Experts agree that Rima Ariadaeus, about 300 km (186.4 mi) long, is a fault system similar to those on Earth.\" The same NASA page also published other photos of Rima Ariadaeus. Below is a screenshot of a Rima Ariadaeus photo taken by NASA from a different angle: NASA responded to the claim here when a social media user flagged it in 2010. \"No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two (or more) parts and then reassembled at any point in the past,\" said Brad Bailey, a staff scientist from the NASA Lunar Science Institute. Professor Paul Groot, an astronomer at Radboud University in the Netherlands, said: \"The 'split' indicated in the bottom picture [in the misleading image] is present on the Moon, but it definitely does not extend around the Moon.\" \"It is a feature that is most likely connected to the impact that created Tycho crater, which is located to the bottom right of the feature in the orientation on the picture,\" he told AFP via email. The image showing two half moons is a composite made from two different photos of the Moon, available on the website of photo agency Getty Images. The first photo, the left part of the image, is titled: \"Last Quarter Moon\" and shows the moon nearing its last quarter phase. The second photo is titled: \"Low Angle View Of Moon Against Clear Sky At Night Photo File\". Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (centre) and the genuine photos (left and right): The last photo in the misleading post, which shows a full moon, can be found on the website of Tufts University, in Massachusetts. The photo is credited to the University of California's Lick Observatory. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (left) and the genuine photo (right):",

But not all of these houses were provided by government, as Sisulu claimed. The department of human settlements' own data shows that between 1996/97 and 2014/15 they had delivered 2,795,256 houses. - Kate Wilkinson Read: FACTSHEET: The housing situation in South Africa Read: Minister Sisulu is right \u2013 SA's housing delivery has almost halved since 2006/07 Claim \"In 1994 just over half of households had electricity, now 85% do.\" Verdict correct A national survey by the Southern Africa Labour Development Research Unit between 1993 and 1994 estimated that 53.6% of households had access to electricity . The latest data from Statistics South Africa shows that 86% of South African households had access to mains electricity in 2014 . Statistics for 2015 will be released later this year. - Kate Wilkinson READ: Zuma wrong on household electricity. About 50% of homes had access in 1994 Claim \"At the last analysis of the ratings of television programmes the parliamentary channel was rated as one of the most watched programmes.\" Verdict mostly-correct The African National Congress opened parliament to live television in 1994 to transform \"a stifled exclusive parliament into a people's parliament\", Sisulu said in her reply. But \"[w]hat went on in this chamber on Thursday last week was nothing but a disgraceful display of tantrums and theatrics,\" she said to describe opposition parties' delaying of the president's address. \"That is very good for television, but we're not competing with Idols here.\" Is the channel indeed one of South Africa's most watched? Africa Check asked South African television magazine tvplus for help with data. Parliamentary sittings are broadcast on channel 408 of satellite television service DStv . However, as it's not a revenue-based channel the parliamentary channel doesn't keep viewership statistics, writer Lav Nandlall established. When SABC2 and the SABC News channel broadcast parliamentary sittings they draw an average of 13,000 viewers on estimate, Nandlall was told. The broadcast of the State of a Nation Address is a different story. On 11 February 2016 nearly 2.5 million viewers tuned into SABC2 to watch the president and opposition parties battle it out for airtime. The SoNA attracted 23.7% of adults watching television at that time, as measured by the Broadcast Research Council of South Africa . Compared to the average viewership of South Africa's most popular soapies in January, parliament's version of \"tantrums and theatrics\" slots between 5th place Scandal (4,008,745 viewers on average) and 6th place Rhythm City (2,468,157). - Anim van Wyk Julius Malema, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Claim \"More than 26 million\" people in South Africa live in absolute poverty. Verdict correct \"Absolute poverty\" generally refers to a specific income threshold below which people would be unable meet their basic needs . Statistics South Africa has three absolute poverty lines which capture different degrees of poverty, lecturer at Stellenbosch University 's economics department, Marisa von Fintel, told Africa Check. \"The food poverty line captures their estimate of what is required in terms of food intake in order to survive, while the lower and upper bounds include the cost of other basic living requirements,\" Von Fintel explained. Malema's claim is correct when we look at the upper bound poverty line. The upper bound poverty line was R779 per person per month in 2011. Statistics South Africa estimated that 27,117,973 people (53.8% of the population) fell below this income threshold that year . At this level someone is considered to be living in poverty but able to buy the necessary food and non-food items they need. There were 18,632,646 people living under the lower bound poverty line, which in 2011 was R501 per person per month. Below this level someone does not have enough income to buy both enough food and non-food items. As a result they will have to go hungry to pay for things like clothing, shelter, transportation or education. In 2011, 10,944,089 people were living below the food poverty line, which equalled R335 per person per month. Someone under this line cannot afford enough food to meet their basic energy requirements of 2,100 calories per day. - Kate Wilkinson FACTSHEET: What is poverty? More claims of S. Africa's 'spectacular transformation' fact-checked Bheki Cele, deputy minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries Claim \"[The agricultural] sector is currently facing the worst drought ever recorded in the history of South Africa.\" Verdict unproven South Africa received the lowest average rainfall between January and December 2015 since 1904 - a total of 403 mm, according to the South African Weather Service . The lack of rainfall has caused agriculture to suffer. As Cele said, South Africa will now have to import maize in order to meet local demand. Chenin Blanc vines grow on a farm managed by the Kleine Zalze estate in Stellenbosch. Photo: AFP/Rodger Bosch\" /> However, receiving the lowest rainfall on record does not automatically mean the current drought is the worst South Africa has ever experienced. That is because lack of rainfall is only one of the factors that lead to a drought. Professor at the Wits Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute , Bob Scholes, told Africa Check that it is therefore still too early to measure the drought's severity or compare it to previous ones. Professor of agrometeorology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Michael Savage added that more research will need to be carried out to measure the extent of the drought. - Lebohang Mojapelo READ: Frequently asked questions about South Africa's drought Phumzile Van Damme, Democratic Alliance spokesman Claim \"The unemployment rate amongst our youth is more than twice that of adults.\" Verdict correct In South Africa the \"youth\" are people aged between 15 and 34 . Using Statistics South Africa's quarterly labour force survey data , Africa Check calculated that 35.8% of people aged 15 to 34 were unemployed between July and September 2015. In comparison, 16.6% of people aged 35 to 64 were unemployed. The broad unemployment rate - which includes unemployed people and discouraged job seekers - showed a similar trend. Youth unemployment was 46.1%, while 23.2% of people aged 35 to 64 were jobless. - Kate Wilkinson Derek Hanekom, minister of tourism Claim \"Recently the influential site Buzzfeed voted South Africa as the most beautiful country in the world.\" Verdict incorrect When a Buzzfeed listicle called \" The 20 most beautiful countries in the world \" was published last year it quickly went viral . Starting with Nepal, the article included countries such as India, Switzerland, Colombia and China, with New Zealand placed third, the United States runner-up and South Africa as number one. However, this post was not a product of Buzzfeed itself, but appeared on the Buzzfeed Community section where anyone can \"share humor, cool stuff you've found, insights into identity and fandom, personality and trivia quizzes, and the occasional ode to Taylor Swift\". Africa Check tried to contact the article's creator \" TravelGuru \" but Brett Vergara, associate community manager of BuzzFeed, said that they \"aren't allowed to give out the contact information of community users\". It's really cool for South Africa that a Buzzfeed user thought it's the most beautiful country in the world, but it's not really something to boast about in parliament, Minister Hanekom. - Anim van Wyk Naledi Pandor, minister of science and technology Claim \"Our government has also taken action to address the funding needs of the poorest as shown as having invested over R50 billion in loans and bursaries via the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS).\" Verdict unproven South Africa's National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) provides financial aid for students in higher education who are \"from poor and working class families who would otherwise not be able to afford to study\". The scheme has been providing study loans and bursaries since 1991, and up to the end of March 2015, had disbursed R49.82 billion worth of financial assistance to students, according to its 2014/15 annual report . This was in aid of 1.5 million students. NSFAS spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo told Africa Check that for the 2015/2016 year they \"had a budget of R9.5 billion which was estimated to fund just over 420,000 students\". However, this is an unaudited figure, he said. Sorry Minister Pandor, but we'll therefore have to rate this claim \"unproven\" until it's confirmed that \"over R50 billion\" has been disbursed. - Lebohang Mojapelo",

A viral message claims that the steam of 100 grams of neem and 100 grams of Giloy twig leaves will cure COVID-19. There is no evidence that this works at all. Giloy twig leaves are used in Ayurvedic medicine. They are said to contain several antioxidants and immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory properties, boost the immune system. They are sometimes used to treat fever, jaundice, chronic diarrhea, cancer, pain, asthma, and skin disease. Neem (Azadirachta indica) is used in Chinese, Ayurvedic, and Unani medicines. It is said to contain h antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. Ayurvedic experts have said that Amla, Giloy, Shilajit, and Neem are medicinal plants that aid to improve the immune system, which is important in fighting any foreign bodies or disease, as Hindustan Times has reported. WHO doesn't recommend home remedies to cure or prevent COVID-19. It recommends following safety measures such as washing hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub, wearing masks, and maintaining at least a 1-meter distance from others to prevent infecting with COVID-19.

        "claim": "\"As long as I have served . . . This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators.\"",
        "doc": "In case you haven't heard, the traditionally blue state of Massachusetts just elected Republican Scott Brown to take the seat of the late Edward Kennedy, a standard-bearer for the the Democratic Party. A lot of ink has been been dedicated to what this means for Democrats in the midterm elections, the party's strength and, of course, the health care reform plan in the Senate. The upper chamber needs 60 votes to prevent a Republican filibuster on the bill, and with Brown's election, Democrats have lost their supermajority. Vice President Joe Biden lamented this obstacle in a speech just days before Brown defeated Democratic Senate candidate Martha Coakley. \"As long as I have served \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen, as my uncle once said, the Constitution stood on its head as they\u2019ve done,\" Biden said at a Florida fundraiser Jan. 17, 2010, according to a White House pool report. \"This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators.\" We're going to check the second part of Biden's statement, that this is the first time in his political career that every decision in the Senate has required 60 votes. But first, some Senate history. Once upon a time, senators could stall debate indefinitely by reading from cookbooks or reciting Shakespeare (think Jimmy Stewart's impassioned speech in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). In 1917, new rules allowed Senate leadership to end debate so long as it had support from two-thirds of the Senate. In 1975, the Senate reduced that to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 senators. Around this time, the old-school filibuster started to become less popular. With only 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster, the majority party would simply file cloture motions -- the technical term to set up a vote to stop debate -- and get on with it, said Senate historian Don Ritchie. Of course, both the minority and the majority have benefited from the tactical tool. The minority can unify and oppose a cloture motion, effectively stalling a bill. And the majority, knowing it has no chance of winning on a vote, can file a cloture motion and then blame the opposition for holding things up. But back to Biden's statement. He won his Senate seat in 1973, just two years before the Senate adopted its new cloture rules, and served until Jan. 15, 2009, shortly before he was sworn in as vice president. The Senate historian's office provided us with a list of cloture votes since 1919, which have been on the uptick in the last three decades. The 110th Congress, which spanned from 2006 to 2008, boasts the most with 112 votes. There were 54 such votes from 2004 to 2006, and 49 vote from 2002 to 2004. There have been 39 cloture votes so far this session, which has been under way since January 2009. Is the increasing use of cloture an example of pure obstructionist politics, as Biden's statement would imply? It's more complicated than that, said Ritchie. In the early '70s, when Biden first came to the Senate, the membership of both the Democratic and Republicans parties were more ideologically diverse and, as a result, party-line votes were scarce, Ritchie said. \"In the late '80s, the two parties became more internally coherent and cohesive,\" he said. \"As a result, leadership was invoking cloture a lot more.\" This dynamic has come to a head in recent years when the Senate leadership, whether Republican or Democratic, has had such narrow majorities, Ritchie said. The minority is more likely to unify against legislation, effectively filibustering a bill. As a result, the majority is essentially forced to round up 60 votes to keep the process going. Sarah Binder, a congressional expert teaching at George Washington University and a fellow with the Brookings Institution, echoed Ritchie. In the early 1970s, senators \"were less likely to vote with fellow partisans, so there was a less partisan use of cloture,\" she said. \"Today, there's no ideological overlap between the parties.\" Binder also pointed out that the size and scope of the leadership's agendas has grown dramatically in recent years, but it has little time to get big things done. Invoking the 60-vote rule is one way to keep the agenda moving. Back to Biden: His overall point -- that the Senate more frequently requires 60 votes to get things done these days -- has some truth to it. According to Senate experts, there have been more and more cloture votes as the upper chamber becomes increasingly split along party lines. But he said \"every single solitary decision has required 60 senators,\" which is an exaggeration. In 2009, for example, there were 397 roll call votes. According to the Senate Historian's office, only 39 of them were cloture votes. Indeed, we found plenty of major bills that did not require 60 votes to start or end debate, including a bill meant to give more children health insurance and a bill to prevent mortgage foreclosures. Furthermore, the Senate frequently passes noncontroversial bills unanimously, so there are countless pieces of legislation such as post office namings and resolutions that don't require 60 votes. As we like to say at PolitiFact, words matter; if Biden had said every \"major\" decision requires 60 votes, he would have been on more solid ground. As a result, we rate his claim False.",

FACT-CHECK The same video was earlier shared by international publications including Daily Mail which claimed that the man was found in a \u201cmummified state\u201d after spending a month in a bear cave. The video was fact-checked by AFP at the time. Most of the outlets had cited Russian organisation The Siberian Times as the source. The video earlier appeared on EurAsia Daily but had been doing rounds on YouTube, sans the \u2018bear cave\u2019 claim, before international media picked it up. In reality, the man\u2019s name is Alexander. According to AFP, he was identified by \u201ca group dedicated to finding missing people in the city of Aktobe in Kazakhstan called Zello Poisk.\u201d The portion underlined in blue in the screenshot above reads: \u201cWe have found that the man in this video is from our city. He is being treated in one of our city\u2019s [Kazakhstan] hospitals and his health is improving.\u201d Rustem Isayev, director of the Aktobe Medical Centre, confirmed to AFP that the man was his patient and was not attacked by a bear. He said that Alexander, a resident of Aktobe, was suffering from the skin disease psoriasis. This was earlier reported by UK-based tabloid The Sun which wrote that Alexander, 41, died of \u201cchronic psoriasis and became critically ill after he ignored his symptoms for months.\u201d The report also stated, \u201cNow a senior medic in the Kazakh city of Aktobe has revealed the former oil worker has died from sepsis caused by a large infected wound.\u201d Alexander passed away on July 25, 2019. Therefore, social media claims suggesting that he is a \u2018yogi\u2019 who was found in a meditative state when dug out from a temple 300 years after being buried alive is false and quite bizarre, to say the least.

Check Your Fact searched Hawaii\u2019sstate websitebut found no announcement of such a rule being implemented. A search of Hawaiian Governor David Ige\u2019swebsitelikewise turned up no mention of Hawaii not recognizing other states\u2019 licenses. Nor did Ige post such an announcement on his verifiedTwitterorFacebookaccounts.\n\nCheck Your Fact reviewed laws published on Hawaii\u2019s state legislature\u2019swebsite, but found no law banning out-of-state drivers in 2023. Had Hawaii passed this law, media outlets likely would have reported on it, yetnonehave.\n\n\u201cThis is not accurate,\u201d Shelly Kunishige, the communications manager for Hawaii\u2019s Department of Transportation, told Check Your Fact in an email when asked about the claim.(RELATED: Did Hawaii Purchase 30 Suicide Assistance Pods?)\n\nIn addition, theCounty of Kauai\u2019swebsite states, \u201cYou may drive in Hawaii with a valid driver\u2019s license issued by another state if you are 18 years of age or older.\u201d\n\nThe claim seemingly stems from a June 15postmade by a Facebook page with the name \u201cState of Hawaii.\u201d The Facebook page does not appear to be affiliated with the state\u2019s government, and islabeledas an \u201centertainment website.\u201d\n\nThe date of enforcement for drivers to obtain a Real ID has been extended to May 3, 2023, according to Hawaii County\u2019swebsite.",

        "claim": "\"Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana.\"",
        "doc": "In a TV interview during a campaign visit to Milwaukee, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson was asked about his support for the legalization of marijuana. He replied by making a claim we want to check. \"And let\u2019s see, 60 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana,\" Johnson said on the Sept. 4, 2016 edition of the \"Upfront with Mike Gousha\" public affairs show on WISN (Channel 12). Only a month earlier, the former Republican governor of New Mexico had made a less aggressive claim, saying \"most\" Americans supported legalization. PolitiFact National\u2019s rating was True, as multiple polls generally showed support in the low 50s. It seems unlikely that in a few short weeks it would jump to 60 percent. But let\u2019s take a look. Previous factcheck When Johnson made his earlier claim, our colleagues found that in 12 of 14 national polls taken since the start of 2014, 50 percent or more of Americans supported legalization. The information, covering a period of more than 2.5 years, was taken from the PollingReport.com database As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. In the three latest polls in the database, the numbers crept closer to 60 percent, with support at 54 percent, 56 percent and 58 percent. But averaging the 14 polls, legalization led 53 percent to 44 percent. Another poll Johnson\u2019s campaign, however, pointed us to another relatively recent poll that wasn\u2019t included in the database. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, conducted in February 2016, found that 61 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be made legal. (Interestingly, 53 percent said marijuana use in their communities was a moderately serious, very serious or extremely serious problem, compared to 45 percent who said it was not at all serious or not too serious.) Reporting on the poll, the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog said the 61 percent support, a notch above Johnson\u2019s claim, was an all-time high. A parting note, though it doesn\u2019t bear on our rating of Johnson\u2019s claim about national numbers: In a July 2016 poll of registered voters in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll asked: When it comes to marijuana, some people think that the drug should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol. Do you agree or disagree with that view? The results: 59 percent agreed, 39 percent disagreed. Our rating Johnson said: \"Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana.\" A March 2016 poll found 61 percent support, but that is the only recent survey we could find showing support that high. Fourteen other polls going back more than two years show a majority of Americans back legalization, but generally support was in the low 50s. We rate Johnson\u2019s statement Mostly True.",

        "doc": "Posts shared on social media claim that eight nutrients \"reverse\" attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \"according to researchers\". The specific \"nutrients\" listed in the post are probiotics, vitamins B6 and B12, fish oil, calcium, magnesium, zinc and Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA). Although ADHD can be treated , for example with medication or therapy, ADHD cannot currently be cured or reversed. While there have been studies into the effects of supplements on ADHD, there is not conclusive proof that they reduce symptoms and certainly no evidence they can \"reverse\" the condition. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What do we know about ADHD and diet? The NHS says that the symptoms of ADHD can be categorised into two issues: difficulty concentrating, and hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Dr Alexander H\u00e4ge, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany, who is researching the effects of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) on ADHD symptoms in adolescents, told Full Fact: \"There is some evidence (a few good clinical trials/ RCTs) that this may be helpful in treating ADHD, but the results are inconsistent. \"The statement that there is evidence that the supplements mentioned below could cure/'reverse' ADHD is definitely false.\" Dr Alejandro Arias V\u00e1squez, an associate professor at Radboud University Medical Center, based in the Netherlands, and scientific coordinator of Eat2beNICE , a medical consortium that studies how lifestyle, nutrition, genetics, and gut microbes contribute to mental health, also told us that the claims in the Facebook post are \"unsupported by scientific data\". He said: \"At this moment the evidence suggests a potential relationship between diet and ADHD. This relationship is still based solely in statistical results and does not support any claim of curing or reversing ADHD.\u2026\" He added: \"ADHD is not reversible nor can [it] be cured.\" Andrea Bilbow, CEO of the National Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service (ADDISS) described the claims in the post as \"misinformation\" and said: \"As far as I am aware there are no nutrients that can reverse ADHD.\" What about the nutrients in the post? The NHS says : \"Some studies have suggested that supplements of omega-3 [found in oily fish ] and omega-6 fatty acids [found in vegetable oils ] may be beneficial for people with ADHD, although the evidence supporting this is very limited.\" This is based on information published by the Association of British Dieticians , who say: \"A number of studies show positive benefits to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, with improvements seen in behaviour and reading ability [in children with ADHD].\" In one article published in 2021, researchers from the Medical University of Warsaw reviewed the available studies which investigated gut microbiota [the millions of microorganisms which live in the human gut] and probiotic therapy [taking probiotic supplements ] in ADHD. They said: \"Numerous studies show that probiotic supplementation can have a positive effect on the course of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD. \"Unfortunately, clinical studies that were identified are mostly inconclusive, and more high-quality research is needed to produce robust evidence for therapy based on interventions targeting microbiota.\" Some very small studies have found that children with ADHD who were given vitamin B6 showed some improvements in their symptoms. A Turkish study of 100 children with ADHD concluded that vitamin B12 \"may be useful in treatment of childhood ADHD, especially for learning problems, besides medication\". An article published in the journal Children looked at iron, magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc deficiencies in children presenting with symptoms of ADHD. It concluded : \"Although it is not definitively clear the percentage of children presenting with symptoms of ADHD who have nutrient deficiencies, the existing literature suggests that a subgroup of children with ADHD are at risk for nutrient deficiencies which may play a role in symptomology.\" Calcium has also been included in studies looking at the role of supplements in improving ADHD symptoms, but there is very little information available on its specific potential benefits. Researchers have reported a link between low levels of GABA in children with ADHD when compared to children without ADHD, though it is not clear that supplements of GABA improve symptoms. Professor Grainne McAlonan , a specialist in translational neuroscience at King's College London told Full Fact that it \"really does not make sense\" that GABA in oral supplement form could \"reverse\" ADHD, as it does not pass through the blood brain barrier [a boundary which allows only certain substances to cross from the bloodstream into the brain in order to protect it from toxins].\" She told Full Fact: \"Blanket unsupported set[s] of statements are not helpful and are irresponsible\u2026 A good diet is good for general good health, let alone ADHD.\" She added: \"This kind of pseudoscientific stuff is not always harmless. \"Moreover, ADHD is not necessarily something that needs to be 'reversed'.\" Image courtesy of Sharon McCutcheon",

        "doc": "U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf says the nation\u2019s fiscal future is dark.\"According to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s long-term estimate, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025,\" Wolf, R-10th, said in a March 28 speech on the House floor.\"That means no money for national defense. No money for homeland security. No money to fix the nation\u2019s crumbling bridges and roads. No money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s diseases,\" Wolf added.Is that really what the nonpartisan CBO said?Dan Scandling, Wolf\u2019s spokesman, said his boss was referring to a June 2011 report from the CBO detailing the agency\u2019s latest long-term outlook on the nation\u2019s fiscal fitness.Tables in the report contain projections showing that by 2025, payments for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and debt interest will exceed all federal revenues going into the budget. That\u2019s a shade different from Wolf\u2019s statement that there won\u2019t be any money at all to pay for additional programs since, beyond using tax revenues, the U.S. also has been known to borrow money to finance its budget.That technical distinction caught the eye of budget analysts we spoke to. But it doesn\u2019t detract from Wolf\u2019s gist that the CBO report shows the growing costs of entitlement programs and debt payments are eating up the government\u2019s resources. The CBO\u2019s scenario of exhausted revenues was based on the assumption that major U.S. policies in effect in June 2011 will continue indefinitely, such as extending the Bush tax cuts and preserving Medicare reimbursement levels to physicians.The CBO also laid out a second, more optimistic outlook that assumed laws on the books in June 2011 will take effect. That means that the Bush tax cuts would actually expire at the end of this year and Medicare payments to physicians would fall sharply in 2013. Under that scenario, revenues through 2085 would always stay above the costs of entitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt.So Wolf is focusing on the bleakest CBO outlook. Is that fair?Jim Horney, a vice-president at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Wolf is not alone in citing the dark scenario. Although current laws call for ending all the Bush tax cuts and lowering Medicare reimbursements, Horney said it will be politically difficult for Congress to carry out these actions.Wolf\u2019s statement is similar to the conclusion reached in 2010 by a bipartisan commission appointed by President Barack Obama to recommend ways reduce the national debt.\"By 2025 (federal) revenue will be able to finance only interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\" the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform stated in its final report. \"Every other federal government activity -- from national defense and homeland security to transportation and energy -- will have to be paid for with borrowed money.\"Two analysts told us the gloomy forecast offers the most realistic map of the financial road ahead.Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said his organization has run its own numbers and concluded that entitlement and debt interest will outpace revenues in 2026.Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition,a group that urges deficit reduction, pointed to a March 2012 report from the General Accounting Office that shows at some point between 2020 and 2030, the amount of spending on entitlements and interest will outpace all federal revenues going into the budget under the more pessimistic scenario.\"The real key is the revenues are still pretty low,\" Gordon said. \"The lower the revenue, the easier it is for spending programs to be larger than it.\"Our rulingWolf said the CBO projects that by 2025, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt as well as spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The CBO report he cites says entitlements programs and debt interest will consume all the revenues going into the budget that year. Wolf\u2019s language is a bit inexact, but we don\u2019t think it detracts from his clear point: the U.S. is on a dangerous fiscal path.We rate his statement True.",

        "claim": "Greg Abbott has benefitted from \"payday lenders who have given him $300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees.\"",
        "doc": "Wendy Davis, asked if she\u2019s unethically profited while in public office, suggested her opponent has committed infractions including one that resulted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations. Responding to a reporter at the Sept. 30, 2014, gubernatorial debate in Dallas, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Fort Worth state senator accused Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican foe, of selling out Texans to serve the \"interests of people who make donations to his campaign.\" As an example, Davis pointed out \"payday lenders who have given\" Abbott\u2019s campaign \"$300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees.\" Davis was revisiting a topic she\u2019s consistently explored: that a 2006 letter from Abbott\u2019s state office allowed payday lenders to skirt state lending laws. After Davis\u2019 proclaimed link between Abbott\u2019s campaign donations and official action was described by the El Paso Times in January 2014, we found Half True her statement that Texas payday lenders were charging 1,000 percent interest. In rare instances, lenders charged 1,000 percent annual interest, but payday loan rates then averaged 465 percent. For this fact check, we gauged whether Abbott piled up hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations and then issued a ruling favorable to payday lenders, which offer low-dollar, high-interest short-term loans targeting low-income people who live paycheck to paycheck. The loans are generally for $100 and $500 and are most often issued for two weeks. They\u2019re considered risky because low-income borrowers are relatively unlikely to be able to pay them back. Abbott campaign contributions To our inquiry about the $300,000 described as given to Abbott, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us records of Abbott campaign contributions as filed in campaign reports at the Texas Ethics Commission covering Sept. 16, 2002 nearly through July 2014. Our own sampling of state records showed Abbott\u2019s campaign fielded: --$80,000 from Trevor Ahlberg, CEO of Irving-based payday lender Cash Store, in eight installments from Aug. 16, 2006 to June 16, 2014; --$57,500 from Roderick Aycox, founder of Georgia-based payday lender LoanMax, in five installments from Nov. 12, 2009 to June 9, 2014; --$30,500 from Cash America International Inc. PAC in 14 contributions from Sept. 16, 2002 to July 29, 2014; --$30,000 from Ace Cash Express Inc. PAC, in eight donations from Oct. 5, 2005 to July 29, 2014. Then again, according to Petkanas and state records, less than 5 percent of the tallied payday-lender donations, or $13,000, had come in by Jan. 12, 2006, which was the date Abbott\u2019s office issued the ruling criticized by Davis. By phone, Petkanas said Davis did not mean to say in the debate that all the $300,000 was given before Abbott\u2019s office ruled on payday lending. Texas Payday Lenders: Regulation and Evasion There's a lot of background to state actions involving payday lenders. In 1999, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, Abbott\u2019s predecessor, filed lawsuits against selected payday lenders, saying the companies were dodging state laws regulating interest rates. Separately, a \"usury\" provision in the Texas Constitution caps interest rates on short-term loans from unlicensed lenders at 10 percent. Cornyn, saying lenders were getting away with interest rates of up to 1,000 percent, said: \"This kind of abusive payday lending is illegal in Texas, and those companies who continue this practice will face serious consequences.\" An October 2000 report by the Sunset Advisory Commission found that \"in recent years, different types of lending businesses have attempted to evade regulation\" including payday lenders. It recommended the Legislature \"authorize\" the \"Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner to regulate payday loans\" in order to \"help control unlawful interest rates.\" In 2001, state lawmakers agreed to changes in law bringing payday lending under the office\u2019s regulation and directing the Texas Finance Commission to adopt rules guiding the industry. According to a May 2001 bill analysis by the House Research Organization, the requested rules \"would prohibit a lender from using a device, pretense, or subterfuge to avoid regulation of the lender\u2019s transactions, including by recharacterizing fees on a loan as a purchase of a good or service.\" Resulting additions to Texas law include a chart specifying acceptable fees for payday loans of various dollar amounts and durations. But in subsequent years, according to Austin American-Statesman news reports, Texas payday lenders found a way around the law by partnering with out-of-state banks, which financed payday loans out of the reach of Texas laws. State and national legislators then raised concerns about payday lenders dodging the restrictions; the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation cracked down in 2005, limiting the number of payday loans a bank could issue and constricting the profitability of partnerships between payday lenders and banks. That\u2019s when Texas payday lenders, under pressure from regulation, started transitioning to a new business model, called a credit service organization (CSO) in summer 2005, the Statesman reported In January 2006. Its news story said Texas payday lenders ditched partnerships with FDIC-regulated banks and began working with \"third-party unregistered lenders.\" It also said Texas \"payday lenders got a boost recently from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott\" in the form of a letter affirming the legality of the CSO model. Between 2004 and 2014, payday lender storefronts increased more than tenfold in Texas, the El Paso Times reported Feb. 4, 2014. Abbott\u2019s interpretation of state law Next, we looked at the Abbott \"ruling\" declared by Davis. It turned out to be an aide's legal analysis. In 2005, the attorney general\u2019s office, headed by Abbott, fielded two requests to review the legality of payday-lender CSOs, agency spokesman Jerry Strickland said by email, one an August 2005 verbal request from the consumer credit commissioner, who inquired after a court case raised questions about whether the state had any sway over CSOs. In Lovick v. Ritemoney Ltd., the plaintiff accused payday lender Ritemoney Ltd. of disguising illegal interest fees as service charges. A state district judge, Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale, wrote that \"Texas law does not construe such credit service fees as disguised interest,\" and the complaint was dismissed. Strickland said the other request for Abbott\u2019s judgment came in writing Sept. 8, 2005 from then-state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. Shapleigh wrote that as a CSO, \"a payday lending company dodges both federal guidelines restricting payday loans and the interest-rate limits established by the Texas Finance Commission. As the state\u2019s leading enforcement agency, it is imperative that your office investigate this new business model and take necessary enforcement actions against businesses purposefully and illegally skirting Texas laws.\" On Jan. 12, 2006, Barry McBee, the state\u2019s first assistant attorney general, signed a letter responding to the commissioner, Leslie Pettijohn, saying there was \"nothing patently illegal\" about payday lender CSOs under state law and there was no statutory limit to the fees they could charge. McBee\u2019s letter pointed out that, in keeping with state law, payday lender CSOs were charging the maximum-permitted 10 percent interest on loans plus service fees to arrange the loan between a borrower and third-party lender. He wrote that, according to Chapter 393 of the Texas Finance Code, there is not \"any limit on the amount of fees\" a CSO can charge in such transactions. \"Any discussion of whether the use of this model is the best public policy choice for the State of Texas,\" McBee wrote, \"is one that must be addressed by the Legislature and has not been explored by this office.\" Legislative Review In the 2013 legislative session, lawmakers debated reforming payday lending practices, but attempts stalled. Expert Analysis By phone, Don Baylor, a former senior policy analyst for the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, said that after the Lovick v. Ritemoney ruling, payday lenders remained uncertain if they could legally operate as CSOs. But, Baylor said, \"it\u2019s fair to say the OAG letter provided enough regulatory certainty for the entire (payday lending) industry to jump on board with the CSO model.\" Baylor also said that after the Lovick ruling, \"the attorney general doesn\u2019t have the authority to prohibit loans from being made under the CSO model.\" He credited the explosion of payday lender CSOs to ambiguous wording in the 1987 Credit Services Organization Act, which was written to help Texans improve credit scores and not with payday lenders in mind, he said. \"Payday lenders found the CSO costume and dressed up in the costume,\" said Baylor. \"It\u2019s a very creative way they came up with to get around the constitutional usury limits.\" Our Ruling Davis said payday lenders gave Abbott $300,000 in campaign donations \"and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees.\" This statement references a 2006 legal analysis -- not a ruling -- from a top state aide to Abbott that tracked with a court ruling permitting payday lenders to charge unlimited fees in spite of state caps on related interest. Clarification is needed in that only 5 percent of the described $300,000 in donations occurred before the analysis was issued. Regardless, Abbott's office reaffirmed a way for politically supportive payday lenders to squeeze Texas borrowers. We rate this statement Mostly True.

        "doc": "Former actress and QAnon conspiracy theorist Cirsten Weldon claimed in a May 6, 2021, interview that Hillary Clinton died in 2020 of kuru, a brain-wasting disease associated with cannibalism. The claim was originally made during an interview with Up Front in the Prophetic, a far-right and pro-QAnon religious podcast that claims \u201cto bring truth and solid biblical answers to the issues of our day.\u201d Weldon\u2019s allegations were then covered by Newsweek after the video was reported by Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way that monitors right-wing activists and organizations. At the 28-minute mark of the video interview, host Francine Fosdick brought up conspiracy theorist Gene \u201cDecode\u201d Consensei, who claimed that Clinton had been \u201celiminated a long time ago\u201d following a 2018 tribunal. Weldon agreed that Clinton had died, but had a different take on the circumstances. \u201cYeah, she passed a long time ago,\u201d said Weldon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was 2018, I think it was about 8 months ago, she died of kuru. And that was not from \u2026 she wasn\u2019t hanged or anything, she just expired \u2026 Hillary was on stage four, they couldn\u2019t help her. She was barely taking a breath a minute.\u201d Kuru is a rare disease of the nervous system similar to mad cow disease that is caused by an infection protein, or prion, found in contaminated human brain tissue. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, kuru is found among a group of people from New Guinea who once practiced a form of cannibalism, whereby individuals would eat the brain tissue of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. Though the practice stopped in 1960, cases of kuru were reported for years and even decades later because the disease has a long incubation period between being exposed and developing symptoms. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke notes symptoms usually include an unsteady gait, tremors, and slurred speech, as well as mood changes. There are no treatments or cures for the disease, and most infected individuals become unable to stand or eat, eventually dying while in a comatose state within six months to a year after symptoms first start to appear. Both Hillary and Bill Clinton have long been at the center of conspiracy theories and online hoaxes for decades. While it is true that Weldon added to the long list of misinformation regarding Hillary Clinton, we found no evidence to suggest that the Democratic politician had died or that she had been infected with kuru. As such, we rate this claim as a \u201cCorrect Attribution\u201d while also noting that no factual basis exists for Weldon\u2019s allegations.",

        "claim": "The health care reform plan would set limits similar to the \"socialized\" system in Britain, where people are allowed to die if their treatment would cost more than $22,000.",
        "doc": "Like other groups criticizing health care reform, the conservative Club for Growth is using the August recess to try to stop the congressional effort to create a government-run health insurance option.Part of the Club's strategy will include a $1.2 million ad campaign aimed at Democrats who may be wavering about the plan. In the ad, a man weeps over someone lying in a hospital bed while the announcer says, \"$22,750. In England, government health officials decided that's how much six months of life is worth. Under their socialized system if a medical treatment costs more, you're out of luck. That's wrong for America.\"That footage is interspersed with shots of the Capitol building and the whole thing is set to some very ominous music. You can watch ithere.The carefully worded ad doesn't directly say that the government is planning to put a price on our lives, but the implication is clear: The reform plan will lead to callous decisions that would allow people to die if they face a costly treatment. So that's what we're going to check \u2014 whether the reform plan would impose those kind of caps on treatment.At its heart, the Club for Growth's ad criticizes a medical approach known as comparative effectiveness research, which aims to find the most effective treatments for the lowest cost.Such research became a flashpoint during the stimulus debate, when the Conservatives for Patients Rights portrayed the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, a new board created by the stimulus bill to find the best health treatments, as being modeled after the British system. In fact, the board is very different from the British system, where government entities run the health care system and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence \u2014 NICE for short \u2014 determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. The stimulus emphasized that the board is not meant to \"mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer\" and that none of the board's reports or recommendations \"shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment.\" So we gave the Conservatives for Patients Rights claim aBarely True.Once again, some Republicans have started linking the general premise of comparative effectiveness and what NICE does in Britain to describe how a government-run plan in the United States would discriminate against people who are older or very sick. Here's one such comment:\"I don't know for sure, but I've heard several senators say that Ted Kennedy with a brain tumor, being 77 years old as opposed to being 37 years old, if he were in England, would not be treated for his disease, because end of life \u2014 when you get to be 77, your life is considered less valuable under those systems,\" said Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, in a news conference with reporters.NICE is an element in the Club for Growth ad as well. The ad refers to a December 2008 article in theNew York Timesthat followed the case of Bruce Hardy, a British man who was denied a $54,000 drug by British health authorities. The article said the drug could have delayed his cancer progression for six months.Under NICE policies, the government would only pay about 15,000 pounds \u2014 or $22,750 \u2014 to save six months of Hardy's life. (NICE's limits are well known and have been widely discussed in the medical community.) The agency generally considers treatments cost-effective if they are less than $34,000 a year, according to an article in theNew England Journal of Medicine.But sometimes the agency will accept treatments that cost far more than that.So the Club for Growth's claim that NICE has a price limit of $22,750 for six months of life is roughly accurate, said Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that is often in step with the Club for Growth.But \"does the (Obama health care) legislation say it's going to do what Britain is doing? The answer to that is no,\" said Cannon.Nevertheless, Cannon doesn't believe that the ad is too far off, pointing to a proposal by the White House that would create an independent group of health experts that would look for inefficiencies in Medicare coverage. \"With the government assuming an even larger majority in health spending, it becomes very hard to argue that they won't have to ration... [Club for Growth] is implying that this is where it would lead and that's valid.\"But at this point, that proposal is not included in either the House or the Senate bill, so we believe it's quite a stretch for the Club for Growth to suggest it would be part of the health reform plan.Dr. Sean Tunis, a former top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under the Bush administration and current director of the Center for Medical Technology Policy, says the ad is misleading.\"We have a public plan now, and that's Medicare,\" Tunis said. \"And Medicare doesn't put a price on life. ... That seems like a fallacious connection to me.\"The only initiative from the Obama administration along those lines is the increase in funding for comparative effectiveness research through the stimulus. That data would be used to help doctors and patients make better drug and procedure decisions, not dictate treatment, he said.So, back to the Club for Growth ad. Although our experts agree that it gets the NICE statistic correct about the British practice, the ad's main point about cost limits is incorrect. There is no such practice in the comparative effectiveness program, nor is it part of the current health reform proposals pending in Congress. The House and Senate bills under consideration would not require the government to decide how much a person's life is worth. As a result, we give the Club for Growth a False.",

        "doc": "Amid recent allegations of rape against some ruling party leaders, a controversial statement attributed to BJP MP Maneka Gandhi is going viral on the Internet. According to a social media post in Hindi, the former Union minister said, \"Vishwa ki sabse badi party hai BJP.. 2-4 balaatkar kar bhi diye toh buraai kya? (BJP is the world's largest party. What's the harm if some rapes happen?)\". India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the statement attributed to Gandhi is misleading. Her actual statement on rape charges against a BJP leader has been represented wrongly. The viral Facebook post was shared by \"Kauser Sayyed\" on September 23. Till the filing of this story, the post has already been shared more than 3,100 times. A similar statement attributing it to Gandhi also went viral in April 2018. With the help of keywords, we came across a news report of Patrika () published on April 13, 2018. According to this report, journalists in UP's Chandauli asked Gandhi whether incidents such as Kathua and Unnao dent the party's image. To this, the former Union minister replied, \"BJP is the world's largest political party with 11 crore members. If 1-2 such cases come up, how can you blame the whole party for it?\" Gandhi's statement can be heard in the YouTube video of V6 News Telugu uploaded on April 13, 2018. An AajTak report says the same thing. Therefore, it can be concluded that Gandhi's original statement was twisted and misrepresented in the viral post. AFWA reached out to Gandhi's personal assistant Anand Chaudhary regarding the viral post. He clarified that the post is fake and she has never given such a statement.

        "claim": "U.S. President Donald Trump is going to \"tactically\" implement voter interference sanctions from a 2018 executive order.",
        "doc": "In mid-December 2020, a copy-pasted (\u201ccopypasta\u201d) meme spread on social media platforms warning \u201cpatriots\u201d that U.S. President Donald Trump was about to \u201ctactically\u201d implement elements of an executive order on election security signed in 2018, telling them to have weapons \u201cat the ready\u201d: The meme is an example of copypasta, a term that refers to blocks of text that go viral when social media users share them by copying and pasting them forward. The incendiary meme appears to reference an executive order signed by Trump on Sept. 12, 2018, ahead of the midterm elections. The meme claimed that Trump was to implement parts of the order at some point between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24, 2020. Here is a portion of the text: This will freeze the money and assets of people and entities to include Facebook, Twitter, the Fake News Corp, AND Chinese U.S. financial accounts. Be prepared to assist the National Guard and the military commands in defense of Our nation. Make sure that you have your weapons at the ready. But DO NOT interfere with the operations of the military. During this time, local law enforcement will have no authority. So, assemble small Patriot teams to patrol and secure your own and surrounding neighbors Trump\u2019s 2018 executive order has nothing to do with military or National Guard deployment domestically, nor does it mention the broad suspension of financial assets of social media platforms and \u201cChinese U.S. financial accounts.\u201d The meme appears to actually be referencing extreme calls by some of Trump\u2019s supporters, echoing his false claims that the November 2020 election was beset by mass-scale fraud and advocating that Trump impose martial law in response. The 2018 executive order \u2014 signed less than a month before the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 was meant as a deterrent against foreign election interference. The order stated that the Trump administration was ready to implement sanctions against any foreign entity that interfered in the election process. It\u2019s noteworthy that the order was signed ahead of the first national election since 2016, during which the Russian government interfered in an effort to sow chaos in the U.S. and help Trump\u2019s electoral efforts. Trump was under political pressure at that time to stem similar interference in 2018. Notably, Facebook and Twitter are American companies, not foreign entities. It\u2019s unclear to us what exactly \u201cFake News Corp\u201d refers to, but unsurprisingly, no such company exists. Sanctions can\u2019t be imposed on a fictional entity. The 2018 executive order relies on various department heads to make determinations about foreign election interference and potential sanctions \u2014 in other words, it doesn\u2019t give Trump unilateral authority to take action. For example, it gives the director of national intelligence 45 days to determine whether foreign interference in an election had occurred, at which point the assessment must be delivered to \u201cthe President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.\u201d After further consultation between these department heads, the executive order then leaves the secretary of treasury, who is currently Steve Mnuchin, to lead in the implementation of economic sanctions. The departments of Treasury and State would then assess whether additional sanctions were necessary and present their findings to the White House. The copypasta meme appears to be inflammatory fear mongering that plays on a disinformation campaign carried out by Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen by way of a massive-fraud conspiracy. Trump\u2019s own U.S. Department of Homeland Security debunked this conspiracy theory by stating that the November 2020 election was in fact \u201cthe most secure in American history.\u201d",

        "claim": "Congress split the Dakotas into two separate states in order to give Republicans four more senators.",
        "doc": "Amid discussions of statehood for Washington, D.C., in late April 2021, a meme spread on social media positing that the Dakota territory was split into the states now known as North and South Dakota in the late 1800s for the purpose of giving the Republican Party more political power, namely more senators and electors. One example is a meme from U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.: The meme read, \u201cCongress split the Dakota territory in half in 1889 to admit two new states with 4 Republican senators. So spare us the fake outrage over DC statehood.\u201d The text was taken from a tweet posted by journalist Ari Berman on April 22. The meme generally responds to congressional Republicans who have stated that allowing D.C., a heavily Democratic region, to become a state will shift the balance of political power in Congress. Noting the racial demographics of D.C. versus other states, some Democrats have accused Republicans of stonewalling D.C. statehood because of racism. It also characterizes current Republican opposition to D.C. statehood as hypocritical, noting that the national Republican party has benefited historically from addition of new states with Republican populations. Writing for The Atlantic in 2019, Boston College historian Heather Cox Richardson wrote: The number of states in the union has been fixed at 50 for so long, few Americans realize that throughout most of our history, the addition of new states from time to time was a normal part of political life. New states were supposed to join the union when they reached a certain population, but in the late 19th century, population mattered a great deal less than partisanship. While McConnell is right to suspect that admitting Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia now would shift the balance in Congress toward the Democrats, the Republican Party has historically taken far more effective advantage of the addition of new states. In 1889 and 1890, Congress added North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming\u2014the largest admission of states since the original 13. This addition of 12 new senators and 18 new electors to the Electoral College was a deliberate strategy of late-19th-century Republicans to stay in power after their swing toward Big Business cost them a popular majority. The strategy paid dividends deep into the future; indeed, the admission of so many rural states back then helps to explain GOP control of the Senate today, 130 years later. Like most things viewed through the lens of history, the reasons North and South Dakota exist as two separate states are complicated by changing context. Business interests, local efforts, and national political wrangling all played a role, but without a doubt, adding North and South Dakota to the growing union of states had the effect of benefiting the national Republican party politically, and they didn\u2019t hide that motivation. But comparing the statehood process for North and South Dakota to current advocation for Washington, D.C. statehood is comparing apples to oranges, said Michael Card, associate professor of political science at the University of South Dakota. That period in American history was drastically different to the current circumstances in many ways \u2014 namely, at that time, a large number of states were in the process of being added into the Union. One of the major factors in deciding statehood was population counts of non-indigenous American settlers. That figure was set at 60,000 in 1787. Another contextual difference was that the nature of the political parties have evolved over time, meaning the Republicans and Democrats of today are not representative of the parties with those names from the late 19th century in many ways. Many of the non-indigenous settlers in the southern part of what was then Dakota territory were Union veterans of the Civil War and their families, who were Republicans. Many likely moved far away from the battlefields in the American South in an effort to get away from traumatic memories, Card noted. Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants tended to settle in the north. As USA Today pointed out, \u201cthe Republican Party was much more concerned with protecting African Americans and their voting rights from its founding through the early 20th century. In the mid-20th century, both parties\u2019 stances on racial equity began to switch.\u201d That switch came after Democratic legislators passed voting and civil rights legislation i the 1960s. Another important point of context the population counts in North and South Dakota justified statehood and that Democrats, who were at that time were in control of national government and aware of the territory\u2019s Republican leanings, had slowed the statehood process, in hopes of gaining a political toehold in the region. But they couldn\u2019t stall forever. According to historian Elwyn B. Robinson in the book \u201cHistory of North Dakota,\u201d there were 190,983 inhabitants in North Dakota in 1890, while there were 348,600 in South Dakota. And in the end, it was Democrats in Congress and Democratic U.S. President Grover Cleveland who relented, signing legislation granting statehood to North and South Dakota, along with Montana and Washington. In \u201cHistory of North Dakota,\u201d Robinson noted that local advocacy also came into play when it came to the creation of the two states. At the local level, there was an internal push for statehood from a small group of influential men who were unhappy with the outside control that came with Dakota being a territory, and who wanted political equality of status. Statehood was a quiet revolution, accomplished by less than two hundred men. The first leaders were Yankton politicians, but all came from southern Dakota and all were Republicans. With few exceptions, they were conservative, middle-class business and professional men\u2013bankers, lawyers, ministers, railroad employees, and newspaper editors. They were of the older American stock and came from New England, New York, or the states of the Old Northwest. They were Republicans because Dakota was a one-party region\u2013a result of the long years of territorial status when the Republican party had control of the United States government. The idea of splitting the northern region off from the southern one started with this group, but not because of political power in Washington, D.C., Robinson wrote: \u201cFrom the beginning the Yankton leaders, a small oligarchy with much influence, planned for the division of the territory at the forty-sixth parallel. Division seemed natural. The railroads ran east and west, so that southern and northern Dakota had little contact with each other.\u201d When Robinson described the decision to ultimately split the territory into two when admitting it into the Union though, he noted that it was pushed hard by the Republican Indiana senator who would become the 23rd U.S. president, Benjamin Harrison: Finally, the program of division, with southern Dakota becoming a state and northern Dakota a territory, was dropped in favor of a bill to admit two states. Senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana pushed it hard and the large population of Dakota (in 1890, North Dakota alone had 190,983 inhabitants and South Dakota 348,600) made further denial seem unjust and irresponsible. In the presidential campaign of 1888 the Republican platform called for admission of two states. Ordway and the Dakota Democrats finally dropped their single-state bill. Both Republicans and Democrats voted for the Omnibus Bill of February 22, 1889, authorizing the framing of constitutions in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington. When the bill finally passed the House of Representatives, some of the members threw books and papers into the air in celebration and there was a general handshaking of congratulation. A step toward equality of status had been taken.",

        "claim": "In Pennsylvania, President Barack Obama\u2019s policies have increased unemployment 19 percent, led to the loss of 37,900 manufacturing jobs, and left 189,000 more people in poverty.",
        "doc": "As President Barack Obama headed to Scranton, Pa., to push for an extension of a payroll tax break on Nov. 30, 2011, the Republican National Committee released a 30-second Web video criticizing him for the economy\u2019s performance on his watch.The ad aired audio clips of a candidate Obama visit to Scranton on March 31, 2008, when he was engaged in a tight primary battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. As the ad shows images of shuttered factories, Obama talks about the nation\u2019s economic difficulties. Several phrases appear on the screen:\"In 2008 \u2026 he promised Pennsylvanians hope & change \u2026 Today: Unemployment up 19% \u2026 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs lost \u2026 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty \u2026 Failed promises. Change direction.\"We\u2019ll take the easy ones first, then take up the complicated one.Unemployment in Pennsylvania is up 19 percent.Making comparisons like these can be a bit confusing, because it\u2019s easy to mix up percentage points and percents. But the number is accurate.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania\u2019s unemployment rate in January 2009 was 6.8 percent, while its rate in October 2011 was 8.1 percent. That\u2019s an increase of 1.3 percentage points, but that can also be expressed as an increase of 19 percent above the initial level.We should point out that Pennsylvania unemployment is actually down by seven-tenths of a point from its peak of 8.8 percent between January 2010 to April 2010. Expressed the way the ad did it, that means unemployment has fallen by 8 percent since its peak.But we have no quibble with the RNC\u2019s methodology.There are 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty.According to the Census Bureau, the number of Pennsylvanians in poverty rose from 1,335,000 in 2008 (the final year before Obama took office) to 1,521,000 in 2010 (the last year for which data is available). That\u2019s a difference of 186,000 -- close enough in our book to the 189,000 cited in the ad.37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs were lost.According to state employment statistics compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number is correct. Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and October 2011, the most recent month for which state figures are available, Pennsylvania did indeed lose 37,900 manufacturing jobs.But that isn\u2019t the end of the story.For starters, it\u2019s PolitiFact\u2019s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. (This policy applies to all three statistics in this ad.)For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians\u2019 policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims something less than True on our Truth-O-Meter.However, the suggestion that manufacturing jobs have declined due to Obama\u2019s policies is even more questionable than most job-related claims we\u2019ve reviewed. As we have noted earlier, the nation\u2019s manufacturing activity has fallen off a cliff over the past 50 years. This stems from countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology.In January 1960, manufacturing jobs accounted for 29 percent of U.S. employment. By March 2011, that had fallen by about two-thirds, to just 9 percent. And in Pennsylvania, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 40 percent since January 1990, the oldest data available for the state on the BLS Website.Based on this context, we think it\u2019s a stretch to blame Obama for the decline in manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania since January 2009. But the claim is even more problematic if you look at how manufacturing in Pennsylvania fared under Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush.Between the time Bush took office in January 2001 and the time he left in January 2009, the number of Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs fell by 244,900. Dividing by Bush\u2019s eight years in the White House, that works out to an annual decline of 30,613 manufacturing jobs.Yet taking the decline under Obama and dividing that by 2.83 years in office works out to 13,376 manufacturing jobs lost per year -- or less than half the rate of decline under Bush.In other words, during the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression, Pennsylvania manufacturing job losses declined less than half as quickly under Obama as under Bush. This clashes with the overall message of the ad, which is that Obama economic policies have failed Pennsylvania, and -- judging by the ad\u2019s imagery -- its manufacturing sector in particular.This may not offer much solace for the Obama camp -- it\u2019s hard to crow, \"The Pennsylvania manufacturing sector eroded more slowly on our watch than it did under our predecessor!\" -- but we do think it\u2019s important context to point out.Our ratingThe ad gets all of its numbers right, but it overreaches by holding Obama fully accountable for these trends. In particular, the RNC\u2019s manufacturing jobs statistic ignores both a decades-long national and state decline in manufacturing jobs and the fact that the rate of manufacturing job losses in Pennsylvania during Obama\u2019s presidency was slower than the rate of job losses under his predecessor, George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",

        "claim": "\"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote\" in the 2016 presidential election.",
        "doc": "While reflecting on the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton was asked why she didn\u2019t campaign more in Wisconsin -- a state that hadn\u2019t gone Republican since 1984, but one she lost to Donald Trump. Appearing May 31, 2017 at a conference in California sponsored by the Vox Media site Recode, Clinton replied by saying \"we thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin,\" but that \"our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been.\" Then the former Democratic nominee pivoted to another issue, contending that Wisconsin\u2019s law requiring photo identification to vote caused voter suppression. \"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think we believed at the time, before the election, that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that.\" Clinton\u2019s claim is similar to one by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that we rated Mostly False. (The Washington Post Fact Checker later gave Baldwin three Pinocchios for the claim.) Baldwin\u2019s claim Baldwin flatly stated that turnout in Wisconsin \"was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of\" the photo ID requirement. The 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which the law was in effect. Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. When we contacted a spokesman at the Democratic National Committee, asking for information to support Clinton\u2019s claim, he referred us to the same report. Comparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin. Had Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin\u2019s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent. Experts told us the methodology is lacking. Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn\u2019t win Wisconsin. Clinton\u2019s statement isn\u2019t as bold as Baldwin\u2019s, in that she refers to an estimate. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the methodology used to make that estimate, as we detailed in the Baldwin fact check, has been widely criticized. A final note from Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. \"Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama,\" he said. \"It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement.\" Our rating Clinton said: \"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote\" in the 2016 presidential election. A report three weeks earlier from a group that supports Democratic candidates says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state\u2019s new photo identification requirement for voting.But experts say that while photo ID requirements may reduce turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn\u2019t vote because of the ID requirement. We rate Clinton\u2019s statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died after being struck with a fire extinguisher during the pro-Trump Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",
        "doc": "On Jan. 8, 2021, The New York Times reported that U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick succumbed to injuries sustained during his on-duty efforts to protect the Capitol from a violent mob of pro-Trump rioters. The latter stormed the building in an effort to stop Congress from formalizing the electoral win of former President Donald Trump\u2019s political rival, U.S. President Joe Biden. Citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, the Times initially reported Sicknick \u201cwas struck with a fire extinguisher,\u201d but on Feb. 16, 2021, the Times updated the story to note that those sources may not have provided accurate information, reporting: Law enforcement officials initially said Mr. Sicknick was struck with a fire extinguisher, but weeks later, police sources and investigators were at odds over whether he was hit. Medical experts have said he did not die of blunt force trauma, according to one law enforcement official. But more than three months later, the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner made public Sicknick\u2019s cause of death. The 42-year-old suffered a stroke and died from natural causes. As the Associated Press reported: Sicknick was among five people who died after the riot. Two men have been charged with assaulting Sicknick in the melee. Investigators initially believed he was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, based on statements collected early in the investigation, according to two people familiar with the case. And they later thought perhaps Sicknick may have ingested a chemical substance \u2014 possibly bear spray \u2014 that may have contributed to his death. But the determination of a natural cause of death means the medical examiner found that a medical condition alone caused his death \u2014 it was not brought on by an injury. The determination is likely to significantly inhibit the ability of federal prosecutors to bring homicide charges in connection with Sicknick\u2019s death. Sicknick\u2019s death has been a source of confusion and sometimes controversy, as illustrated by the evolution of reports about it. When the New York Times updated their story that originally reported Sicknick was hit with a fire extinguisher, it resulted in a round of stories about the update, primarily in right-leaning outlets. \u201cNew York Times quietly updates story that spread now-debunked claim about police officer Brian Sicknick\u2019s death,\u201d a headline on the Blaze website reported. On Jan. 7, Capitol Police had issued a news release stating Sicknick \u201cwas injured while physically engaging with protesters, and passed away at 9:30 p.m. the following day \u201cdue to injuries sustained while on-duty.\u201d Capitol Police said in that news release that Sicknick collapsed after returning to his division office the day of the assault on the Capitol, then was taken to a local hospital, where he died the following night. The release stated Sicknick\u2019s death was being investigated by the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s (MPD) homicide branch, Capitol Police, and federal law enforcement. But early on, Sicknick\u2019s brother, Ken Sicknick, had told the non-profit news outlet ProPublica that Brian Sicknick\u2019s family was informed the officer had suffered a stroke resulting from a blood clot. Sicknick\u2019s wasn\u2019t the only law enforcement death that immediately followed the riot. Police were overwhelmed and overrun, and outnumbered officers tried to fend off rioters who were assaulting them from all sides. Roughly 140 police officers were injured, some seriously.Two other officers, Howard Liebengood of the Capitol Police and Jeffrey Smith of the Metropolitan Police, took their own lives in the days following the attack. The U.S. Department of Justice announced on March 15, 2021, that two men, Julian Elie Khater and George Pierre Tanios, were arrested and charged with counts related to violence at the Capitol including assaulting police officers. The men are accused of spraying three officers, including Sicknick, with an unknown chemical substance. If you need help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255.

        "claim": "Covid-19 vaccines cause two deaths for every three they prevent",
        "doc": "A peer-reviewed study that spread on social media claims Covid-19 shots are dangerous and governments should rethink their vaccination campaigns. But the scientific paper used a flawed methodology and has been retracted by the journal. A paper titled \"The Safety of Covid-19 vaccinations -- we should rethink the policy\" was initially published on June 24, 2021 in the scientific journal Vaccines. It can be read on MDPI, an online publishing platform for unrestricted access to peer-reviewed journals. Figures including Robert Malone, a physician who has been vocal in the media about the potential dangers of the Covid-19 vaccination, and Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati, known for representing health freedom groups in lawsuits, were among those spreading the paper on social media. Malone, who conducted research on the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology 30 years ago, said the study concluded that for every three deaths prevented by Covid-19 shots, the jabs had caused two deaths. Posts highlighting the study appeared on Facebook here and here, Instagram here, and Twitter here. But it was retracted, and Malone's tweet is no longer available. In its retraction note, the journal said: \"The article was evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief with the support of several Editorial Board Members. They found that the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings.\" The authors of the study had used a metric called the \"number needed to vaccinate\" or NNTV, based on an Israeli database. They then compared the NNTV with the number of adverse events reported after vaccination, filed to the Dutch national safety reporting database -- a database similar to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States. \"Currently, our estimates show that we have to accept four fatal and 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations in order to save the lives of 2\u201311 individuals per 100,000 vaccinations, placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude,\" the study concluded. It said that the \"lack of clear benefit\" from the Covid-19 shot should push governments to rethink their vaccination policies. The journal says the study used the Dutch data inaccurately. Eugene van Puijenbroek, head of science and research at the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb (Lareb) -- the Dutch database used in the paper -- agreed, saying: \"The data as mentioned on our website were interpreted incorrectly and therefore led to erroneous conclusions.\" \"The obvious incorrect and misleading use of our data was the reason for us to contact the editorial office of Vaccines to ask for withdrawal of the article,\" he told AFP. Lareb is responsible for maintaining the national database for the reporting of adverse drug reactions in the Netherlands, including adverse events potentially linked to the Covid-19 vaccines. But in its reports, the Dutch database does not draw a direct connection between the deaths post-vaccination and the vaccination itself, van Puijenbroek said. \"In fact, our analyses showed that in cases in which fatality has been reported, existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases,\" he said. \"We explicitly ask reporters, either healthcare professionals or the general public to report suspicions of adverse events,\" but a causal relation between a particular health incident and the reported drug or vaccine is not needed for a report to be filed, van Puijenbroek added. As of July 12, at least two members of the board of Vaccines have resigned following the publication of the paper. Katie Ewer, an associate professor and senior immunologist at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, resigned on June 27. \"I had no role in the publication\" of the paper, she told AFP, but after reading about the study on social media, Ewer decided to look into how it had been peer-reviewed. She said that neither the academic editor nor the only reviewer who was not anonymous were vaccine specialists, and also highlighted major problems with the study and its methodology. \"It should have been recognized that this paper would have a big impact, given the conclusions that it (incorrectly) draws,\" Ewer said. \"That no one at the journal picked up on that and realized that the data were going to be subjected to intense scrutiny and attention is very worrying, especially for a journal dedicated to vaccines, and that's why I felt resignation was my only option.\" Florian Krammer, professor at the Department of Microbiology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, also resigned from Vaccines' board after the publication of the paper in the journal. \"I was made aware of the paper yesterday, read it, sent an email to the editorial staff... and then resigned from my role at the journal,\" he tweeted on June 26. AFP has addressed the misuse of similar databases that record adverse events in previous fact checks, including here and here.",

        "claim": "Mexico receives \"approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens.\"",
        "doc": "Donald Trump\u2019s new plan to get Mexico to pay for a wall along the Southern border is drawing comments from all sides. Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said if the plan works, it\u2019s \"fantastic.\" President Barack Obama, on the other hand, called it \"half-baked.\" The plan, released on April 5, 2016,reads as a series of hypotheticals. Trump claims barring undocumented immigrants from sending wire transfers would entice Mexico to pay for the wall. \"They (Mexico) receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens,\" Trump said. In turn, Trump argues that he would not let the wire transfer ban go into effect if Mexico contributes \"the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall.\" We were curious as to whether most Mexican wire transfers, using services such as Western Union, come from undocumented immigrants. Hard to tell We did not hear back from Trump\u2019s press office but readily found data on remittances -- or how much money is transferred from the United States to Mexico. According to Bank of Mexico, there was $24.77 billion in remittances to Mexico in 2015. So Trump\u2019s first claim checks out, but the second part is not that simple. \"We don\u2019t know of any estimate by any organization or researcher of what share of remittance senders are unauthorized immigrants \u2013 or indeed are immigrants of any legal status,\" said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \"Keep in mind that some number of U.S. born who are of Mexican heritage might also still send remittances.\" San Diego State University economics professor Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes worked on a paper on remittances published in the 2005 Economic Review. The paper estimates that 75 percent of undocumented Mexican immigrants have the probability to remit money. It also notes that these immigrants send almost $439 a month on average to Mexico. The Pew Research Center estimates that there are 5.6 million undocumented Mexican immigrants living in the United States as of 2014. Using these three numbers, Alfredo Cuecuecha Mendoza, an economic expert and president of El Colegio de Tlaxcala, A.C. in Mexico, estimates that 48 percent of remittances are sent by undocumented Mexican immigrants. Overall, Pew estimates that there are 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Amuedo-Dorantes said undocumented immigrants are more likely to remit money than documented immigrants, who are often settled with their family in the United States. \"That said, it is also the case that legal migrants have better paying jobs and, in absolute terms, are able to remit more than the undocumented. So I am not sure his (Trump\u2019s ) statement is correct,\" she said. Manuel Orozco, a remittance expert at Washington D.C. think tank Inter-American Dialogue, said it is \"not possible\" to say how much of the billions Mexico receives from remittances come from undocumented immigrants. \"Sounds like a guess to me,\" said Roy Germano, a remittance expert and international relations professor at New York University. Our ruling Trump said, \"they (Mexico) receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens.\" The number is right, but saying the majority of that money comes from undocumented immigrants is a pure guess. One estimate, based on data more than a decade old, could associate 48 percent of remittances withundocumented Mexican immigrants. But that\u2019s a stretch at best -- and it\u2019s still not the majority -- as Trumpclaims. Experts we spoke with said there is no way to track undocumented remittance senders. All in all, we rate Trump\u2019s claim Half True.",

        "claim": "NASA issued a warning that Earth could be hit by an asteroid around Christmas 2019.",
        "doc": "On Oct. 23, 2019, the U.K. tabloid Express published an article that left some readers believing they need not make Christmas plans this year because Earth was in danger of being hit by a large asteroid: The article was entitled \u201cAsteroid terror: NASA spot mammoth space rock to hit Earth\u2019s orbit five days before X-mas.\u201d The subheading gave earthlings an even smaller chance of survival: \u201cAN ASTEROID the size of the World Trade Centre is on a dangerous Earth-bound orbit that could see the rock smash the planet during Christmas festivities.\u201d When the article was regurgitated by even less-reputable websites, the fear-mongering title morphed into a factually inaccurate claim. For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title \u201cNASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!\u201d NASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas. These articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there\u2019s nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1. NASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles. Dr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is \u201cnothing unusual or dangerous\u201d about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1: No, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth. Astronomers have been observing this asteroid\u2019s position for 13 years, we know its orbit very accurately, we can predict its close approaches accurately for the next 200 years, and we know with certainty that it cannot hit our planet. Lindley Johnson, NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Officer and Program Executive of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), also told us that this asteroid \u201cposes no hazard to impacting earth\u201d: NASA and other US agencies are lead players in the international effort to develop plans to respond to a possible Near-Earth Object (NEO) impact. In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States\u2014and the world\u2014for detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic. NASA is approximately 35% complete for NEOs 140 meters and larger, and approximately 96% complete for those 1 km and larger. Strategic investments in our space-based programs will lead to the benefit of all of humanity as we continue to catalogue any NEOs that pose a potential threat. This particular asteroid\u2019s trajectory has been well tracked by NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies since it\u2019s discovery 13 years and poses no hazard to impacting Earth. Here\u2019s a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS. The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours): On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026 \u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them. NASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does. But the 19,000 NEOs in NASA\u2019s database aren\u2019t really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered: Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 \u2013 approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size \u2013 takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact \u2013 such as the Chelyabinsk event \u2013 could occur at any time. Still, the chances of an asteroid larger than 140 meters hitting earth in the next 100 years is minimal: The current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size\u2013larger than a small football stadium\u2013and to characterize a subset representative of the entire population. Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date. Asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 will pass by Earth a few days before Christmas. However, NASA has issued no warnings about a catastrophic impact, and CNEOS reports that this asteroid will get no closer than 3 million miles from Earth during its approach.",

        "claim": "Gov. Ron DeSantis raised \"taxes on the middle class by more than $1.5 billion while giving away $624 million to big corporations.\"",
        "doc": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt an economic burden on \"the everyday American.\" DeSantis' Democratic rival in the governor's race, Charlie Crist, countered in a tweet that DeSantis raised taxes on Floridians in the middle class. DeSantis raised \"taxes on the middle class by more than $1.5 billion while giving away $624 million to big corporations,\" Crist said in an Aug. 25 tweet. Ron DeSantis: Raises taxes on the middle class by more than $1.5 BILLION while giving away $624M to big corporationsJoe Biden: Forgives $10,000 of debtRon DeSantis: \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 DeSantis has criticized Democratic-led states like New York for imposing large tax burdens on their residents. So, we wondered whether Crist's portrayal of DeSantis' tax policy was accurate. PolitiFact found that DeSantis signed a bill to revise Florida's online sales tax in 2021 \u2014 but the tax isn't new and didn't target the middle class. Although corporations received a $624 million refund during DeSantis' tenure, there's more context to know than Crist provided. Crist is talking about a law DeSantis signed in 2021 that changed how the state collects sales taxes on online transactions. The law, SB 50, requires online marketplaces with no physical presence in Florida to collect and remit sales tax on items delivered to customers in the state. The state estimated it would generate about $1 billion a year. (The state's revenue department did not confirm the amount it collected when we asked about Crist's $1.5 billion claim.) Florida already had a 6% sales and use tax on goods. Before SB 50, customers were expected to contact the state's Department of Revenue and pay the tax owed on their purchases from remote sellers. But compliance was \"notoriously low,\" a legislative staff analysis found. Florida changed the law after a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling eliminated the requirement that sellers have physical presence in a state to collect and remit taxes to that state. Experts told PolitiFact that SB 50 didn't create a new tax but shifted the responsibility to remit sales tax from consumers to the remote seller. \"The ability to require a broader range of sellers to collect at point-of-sale increases collections, but it is an enforcement action, not a new tax,\" said Jared Walczak, a researcher at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based research group. The Tax Foundation neither endorsed nor opposed the legislation in 2021 but noted that the revision held merit and that more than 40 states have enacted similar legislation \"on a broad bipartisan basis.\" Although Florida consumers are paying taxes on some purchases they previously hadn't paid them on, we found no evidence to support Crist's claim that the law targeted the middle class. \"People of all income classes make online purchases,\" Walczak said. \"Nothing about increasing enforcement of the already existing sales and use tax targets a particular income bracket.\" Crist's campaign cited HB 7127 \u2014 legislation DeSantis signed in 2019 that extended a temporary corporate tax reduction set into motion by former Gov. Rick Scott in 2018. Scott signed the initial tax refund to offset changes brought about by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which expanded the definition of corporate income while reducing federal corporate tax rates. That act resulted in more taxable income for Florida corporate income taxpayers and would have increased corporations' state tax liabilities. The 2018 bill lowered the corporate tax rate, which triggered an automatic refund for eligible corporate taxpayers. DeSantis allowed the downward adjustment of corporate tax rates to continue for another two years. In spring 2020, he snubbed calls from Democratic lawmakers to cancel the tax refund. A Florida Department of Revenue spokesperson told PolitiFact it refunded nearly $624 million to the state's corporate taxpayers this year. The refunds benefited more than 21,000 corporate taxpayers, the spokesperson said. Crist said DeSantis raised \"taxes on the middle class by more than $1.5 billion\" and gave $624 million to \"big corporations.\" That's misleading. Although DeSantis signed legislation to revise Florida's online sale tax \u2014 which the state estimated would generate around $1 billion annually \u2014 the law neither established a new tax nor targeted only the middle class. Crist had more of a point when considering the amount of money Florida refunded to large corporations. The Florida Department of Revenue told PolitiFact it refunded nearly $624 million to the state's corporate taxpayers this year. In 2019, DeSantis signed legislation that extended a provision \u2014 signed by former Gov. Rick Scott \u2014 that temporarily reduced corporate income tax rates. The refunds benefited more than 20,000 corporate taxpayers, according to the state Department of Revenue. Crist's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "doc": "Images of tweets shared on Facebook suggest that those who used the anti-parasitic medication ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment or prevention might have to contend with some unpleasant side effects. \"Ivermectin\u2019s hidden cost: New studies show that 68% of those who used ivermectin to treat or prevent Covid are suffering long-term bowel and urinary incontinence,\" read what looked like a screenshot of a verified Fox News tweet. The screenshot, which was shared on Facebook on May 13, also showed an alleged reply to the Fox News tweet from conservative commentator Candace Owens. \"Well this explains a few things,\" Owens appeared to say, adding an emoji with a distressed expression. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These tweets are fake. And these \"new studies\" with troubling ivermectin findings don\u2019t exist. The entire thing is fabricated. (Screengrab from Facebook) The screenshot was shared by a Facebook account using the name \"Turning Points USA\" \u2014 an apparent jab at Turning Point USA, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk where Owens once worked as a spokesperson. PolitiFact searched Owens\u2019 and Fox News\u2019 verified accounts and archives of their tweets and found no evidence that either account had ever shared the tweets from the screenshot. Also, if you look closely at the upper right corner of the fake Fox News tweet in the image, you\u2019ll see the phrase \"r/totallyrealtweets,\" which suggests the image is linked to a Reddit community that shares fake and satirical tweets. Ivermectin has been studied as a COVID-19 treatment, but neither the Food and Drug Administration nor the National Institutes of Health\u2019s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommend using ivermectin to treat COVID-19. As of April 29, the NIH panel \"recommends against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, except in clinical trials.\" In frequently asked questions from April 2021, the FDA said: \"While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\" The FDA said that side effects associated with ivermectin use include things such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, limb swelling, sudden blood pressure drops and liver injuries. Because of the potential side effects, \"any use of ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 should be avoided as its benefits and safety for these purposes have not been established.\" Public health organizations\u2019 repeated warnings didn\u2019t stop people from promoting the drug for COVID-19, and some doctors continue to prescribe ivermectin for the virus. Still, we found no evidence to suggest that \"long-term bowel and urinary incontinence\" should be among the legitimate concerns for people who used the anti-parasitic against COVID-19 in the face of such warnings. We were unable to find any \"new studies\" that found 68% of people who used ivermectin for COVID-19 were experiencing such side effects. Our searches for those studies turned up only fact-checks debunking these fake tweets and a 2017 study that looked at the effects of administering ivermectin to a large group of people in Democratic Republic of Congo. In that study, people reported \"a wide range of adverse events, including headache, coma, abnormal gait, stupor, asthenia, conjunctival hemorrhage, fever, back pain, urinary incontinence and psychiatric disorders\" after taking the drug. That was, of course, years before COVID-19 was first detected. An image shared on Facebook suggests Fox News and Candace Owens tweeted that \"new studies show that 68% of those who used ivermectin to treat or prevent covid are suffering long-term bowel and urinary incontinence.\" These tweets are fake, and there\u2019s no evidence that \"new studies\" with troubling ivermectin findings about incontinence actually exist. We rate this claim False.",

        "doc": "A post claiming that Boris Johnson made a number of pro-EU arguments in 2013 has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook and Twitter . It claims he said the EU: \"is better placed to strike trade deals with the US, or China, than the UK on its own. More generally, there is a risk that leaving the EU will be globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing to do.\" These words are taken from an article Mr Johnson wrote for the Telegraph in 2013, but they have been edited and taken out of context to make it seem like he's unambiguously arguing against leaving the EU. The article is actually titled \"We must be ready to leave the EU if we don't get what we want.\" (Although he also writes: \"As it happens, I think the question of EU membership is no longer of key importance to the destiny of this country.\") In it, Mr Johnson presents four possible arguments for staying in the EU, and four for leaving it. Amongst the arguments for staying in the EU, he said that the EU is \"arguably\" in a better place to make trade deals, and separately he wrote that leaving it might appear xenophobic, although he says that both these propositions are \"untested\". These two points have been edited together, with the word \"arguably\" and several counterarguments removed, to produce the quote circulating on social media. The full quote of his third and fourth arguments in favour of remaining reads: \"3) Global influence. The EU is arguably better placed to strike trade deals with the US, or China, than the UK on its own, though this proposition is plainly untested, and the idea of an EU \"Common Foreign Policy\" is plainly a joke. Where was the EU on Iraq, or Libya? What, come to that, is the EU position on the Falklands? \"4) Perception of UK. It is often said that our strategic significance for the Americans or the Chinese depends on our membership of the EU; though, again, this is untested. More generally, there is a risk that leaving the EU will be globally interpreted as a narrow, xenophobic, backward-looking thing to do.\" His arguments in support of leaving the EU included the fact that leaving the EU would save money, regain sovereignty, would allow the UK to \"make our own laws again\" and mean that \"we can no longer blame Brussels\". During the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Johnson backed the Leave campaign.",

        "claim": "\"15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it\u2019s $10,000 a month.\"",
        "doc": "Patients used to pay $10,000 a year for cancer drugs, but now they\u2019re paying $10,000 a month, according to HBO talk show host Bill Maher. That\u2019s a message circulating on Facebook recently, promoted by the\"Bill Maher Fanpage.\" A reader asked us to check it out. The quote comes from the Oct. 2 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, where Maher discussed Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight. \"Not that (Turing CEO Martin) Shkreli is unusual for the pharmaceutical industry,\" Maher said on his show. \"Fifteenyears ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it\u2019s $10,000 a month because this cartel owns the U.S. government every bit as much as Mexican drug lords own theirs.\" It\u2019s well known that the cost of health care is on the rise,but has the annual cost of cancer drugs really increased so dramatically in just a decade and a half? Maher\u2019s team sent us links to some news articles about the rising cost of cancer drugs, and we tracked down information that speaks to his claim. The best information we could nail down is the cost of anticancer drugs at launch,the initial price when the Federal Drug Administration approves a drug. These are the sticker prices set by the pharmaceutical companies, not the prices patients actually pay out of pocket, which are reduced by insurance payments, patient assistance programs and other discounts. Costs increases, though, are often passed on to consumers. Maher has a point that cancer drug costs are on the rise. We charted the launch costs of cancer drugs the FDA approved since 1999, using a list compiled by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The second half of Maher\u2019s statement -- that cancer drugs now cost about $10,000 a month -- is also on solid ground. Of drugs approved in 2015, the monthly average cost is $11,319. And experts in the field often cite that $10,000 figure themselves. Because many cancer drugs are not administered to patients for a full year, it\u2019s difficult to determine an average annual cost, so the first half of Maher\u2019s statement -- that they cost about $10,000 a year 15 years ago -- is hard to nail down. To his point, though, the monthly cost of a new drug was dramatically lower in 2000 than what it is now at about $4,634. One of the news articles that Maher\u2019s team sent us is an academic article in the Journal of Oncology Practice that supports his statement. The report reads, \"The average cancer drug price for approximately one year of therapy or a total treatment duration was less than $10,000 before 2000.\" Maher\u2019s statement is \"in the ballpark,\" if not an understatement, said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago who researches cancer drug prices. In a 2015 paper Conti authored with three other leading health economists, she examined the launch cost of anticancer drugs controlled for inflation and the benefit to the patient (how much it prolongs life expectancy). For example, in 1995, anticancer drugs cost $54,100 for an additional year of life, the study found. In 2005, drugs cost $139,100 for the same benefit, and the price grew to $207,000 in 2013. In the United States, pharmaceutical companies set their own drug prices. What\u2019s pushing them to increase the costs? It\u2019s not necessarily that cancer drugs are getting better and are thus worth more. Conti\u2019s research concluded that just about one-fifth of the cancer drug cost increase can be attributed to a better product. There are two primary forces behind annual cancer drug cost increases, Conti said: First, pharmaceutical companies estimate a \"zone of indifference\" -- based on last year\u2019s prices, how much more would buyers be willing to pay? Second, rebates and discounts for drugs have also increased over time, and this creates an incentive for drug companies to increase their costs alongside the discounts. Pharmaceutical companies defend drug price increases by emphasizing that the revenue funds innovative research and that drugs lower overall health care costs by treating illnesses. Because there\u2019s no formal price regulation and competition in the industry is rare, \"It really is a system where there\u2019s no downward pressure on drug prices,\" said Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes in an interview with Fortune. Our ruling Maher said, \"15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it\u2019s $10,000 a month.\" The average annual cost of a drug isn\u2019t easy to calculate, given the way cancer drugs are scheduled; many drugs aren\u2019t used every month for an entire year. So the first half of the statement is hard to verify,though we did find one academic source that cites a similar figure. However, Maher has a point that the cost of cancer drugs has increased dramatically since 2000, when the average monthly price of a cancer drug, when it first hit the market, was about $4,600. In 2015, the monthly cost is over $10,000. Maher\u2019s numbers are a little squishy, but they\u2019re in the ballpark. We rate his claim Mostly True.",
