        "claim": "Did Joe Biden Never Get More Than 1 Percent When He Ran For President?",
        "doc": "President Donald Trump said that former Vice President Joe Biden never got more than 1 percent of the vote when he ran for president.\n\nVerdict: Unsubstantiated\n\nBiden has never campaigned for president in a general election, but he has competed unsuccessfully for the Democratic Party nomination twice.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is worded vaguely, leaving it open to interpretation. While Biden never earned more than 1 percent of the delegate count at a party convention, he did get more than 1 percent of the vote in a couple of state primaries during the 2008 presidential race.\n\nFact Check:\n\nTrump cited Biden\u2019s presidential election record after he said that he would like to run against him in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI dream about Biden. That\u2019s a dream,\u201d Trump said in an interview withCBS Newson July 19. \u201cLook, Joe Biden ran three times. He never got more than 1 percent, and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did.\u201d\n\nBiden actively campaigned for president in the1988and2008election cycles. He thought\u00a0about campaigning for president in1984, and even filled out paperwork for his candidacy in theNew HampshireDemocratic primary.\n\nBut he ultimately decided not to submit the paperwork. \u201cI had no intention of running in 1984, and the people closest to me knew that,\u201d Bidenwrotein his 2007 memoir.\n\nNonetheless, Biden still gotone delegate votein support of naming him the Democratic Party nominee for president at the 1984 Democratic National Convention \u2013 0.03 percent of the vote.\n\nHe officially campaigned to secure the Democratic nomination for president in the 1988 cycle, butwithdrewfrom the race in September 1987 before there were any primaries or caucuses.\u00a0News storiespublishedin the daysleading uphis withdrawal showed that parts of Biden\u2019sspeecheswere similar to passages in other public figures\u2019 speeches and revealed that he had plagiarized an article while in law school at Syracuse University.\n\nBiden said that he had misunderstood the rules of citation when he committed plagiarism, according tofilesin his law school records. As for the speeches, aides said that they meant to include attribution in one of them and that he was paying homage to historical leaders in others.\n\nDespite dropping out of the race, Biden gottwo votes\u2013 0.05 percent \u2013 when delegates at the 1988 Democratic National Convention chose the party\u2019s nominee for president.\n\nBiden sought the Democratic presidential nomination again 20 years later in 2008. After coming in fifth place in the\u00a02008Iowa Caucuson Jan. 3, earning 0.9 percent of the vote, hewithdrewfrom the race.\n\nBiden did get more than 1 percent of the vote in a couple of state primaries after he had suspended his campaign, however. He got 3 percent of the vote inDelaware\u2013 his home state \u2013 on Feb. 5. In theLouisianaprimary on Feb. 9, he earned 1.6 percent of the vote.\n\nSomewhat ambiguously, Trump said that Biden \u201cnever got more than 1 percent.\u201d If he was referring to Democratic primaries, then his claim is incorrect. But if Trump was thinking of Biden\u2019s performance in the\u00a01984, 1988 and 2008 Democratic National Conventions, then he is correct. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, then a senator, later choseBidento be his running mate in 2008. Biden became his party\u2019s nominee for vice president at the 2008 Democratic National Convention byacclamation, with no votes cast, and he did not receive anydelegate votesfor president at the convention. Obama and Biden were elected president and vice president in 2008 and re-elected in 2012.\n\nBiden told the Los Angeles Times that heplanned onentering the 2016 presidential race but decided not to because his adult son Beau Bidenpassed awayin 2015 after battling brain cancer.\n\nThough he performed poorly in presidential contests, Joe Biden has successfully run for state and local office. He served as a senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2009 afterunseatingincumbent Republican Sen. J. Caleb Boggs in the 1972 election and won sixre-electionraces. Before his Senate career, Bidenservedas a New Castle County councilman.\n\nFollow Emily on Twitter\n\nPublished: Wednesday, July 25, 2018\n\nHave a fact check suggestion?

        "claim": "\"We\u2019re $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that\u2019s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined.\"",
        "doc": "During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the economy and the federal budget.\"We all understand that the spending crisis is extraordinary, with $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that\u2019s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined.\"If this sounds familiar, it is: It\u2019s a variation on a claim we\u2019ve addressed before.Romney said something similar at a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., on June 27, 2011. Romney said that Obama \"is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined.\" We rated the statement Mostly True.But the second statement won\u2019t get the same rating, for a couple of reasons.Type of debt being measuredThere are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities.The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future.In June, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us that the candidate was referring to debt held by the public, so we used that for our measurements. But Romney\u2019s comment from the Sioux City debate was less clear. In the debate, Romney initially said the nation is \"$15 trillion now in debt.\" That\u2019s a measure of gross federal debt -- which is not the measurement he\u2019d been using in previous statements.We were confused about how to proceed, so we checked with the Romney camp. They confirmed that Romney was basing his comparison on public debt. That clarifies our assignment, but it does mean that Romney offered contradictory information in making his debt comparison.Time frameIn the earlier statement at the New Hampshire roundtable, Romney was pretty clear that he was talking about how much Obama will have added \"by the end of his first term.\" By contrast, the more recent statement from Sioux City lacks that qualifier, and instead makes it sound like Romney was referring to the amount of debt Obama has racked up so far in his term. The extra year or more in Obama\u2019s first term adds enough debt to make a significant difference in the result.To analyze Romney\u2019s comparison requires determining the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama\u2019s first term. This is not as easy as it sounds.Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who \"owns\" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush\u2019s term, and it does not really bear Obama\u2019s imprint.When judging Romney\u2019s claim from the Sioux City debate -- how much debt has accumulated so far during Obama\u2019s term -- we believe that there are three plausible date ranges:-- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Dec. 14, 2011 (the day before the Sioux City debate)-- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama\u2019s inauguration) to Dec. 14, 2011-- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Dec. 14, 2011We are able to calculate the debt figures using the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator. Here are the public debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above:* End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined.* Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined.* End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined.What\u2019s the meaning of \"almost\"?In the Sioux City debate -- but not the New Hampshire roundtable -- Romney gave himself some breathing room by inserting the word \"almost.\" But what he meant by that \"almost\" is not so obvious.In the actual quote, Romney places \"almost\" before \"every president.\" We\u2019re not quite sure how one would define \"almost every president\" -- do you drop George W. Bush, who accumulated a lot of debt, or William Henry Harrison, who died a few weeks into his term? If you subtract George W. Bush from the calculation, it's a very favorable way to calculate it from Romney\u2019s perspective, and in fact for one of the measurements -- comparing the accumulated debt level at the start of fiscal 2001 to what Obama has added so far, Obama\u2019s figure is higher.But when we talked to the Romney camp, they said that the candidate had actually meant to say, \"almost as much debt as.\" So how does that formulation mesh with our math above?Under the first of our three scenarios, the debt under Obama has increased by about 78 percent of the amount it rose under the previous 43 presidents. That\u2019s off by more than 20 percent. The other two scenarios don\u2019t come that close. For the second scenario, it\u2019s 65 percent, and for the third, it\u2019s 38 percent.An additional point that affects all comparisons of this sort: Because of the effects of inflation, it\u2019s not entirely fair to compare debt accumulated today to debt accumulated in the time of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt. But neutralizing that problem isn\u2019t easy, so we won\u2019t do anything beyond noting the issue.Our rulingRomney was trying to revive a talking point -- that by the end of his first term, Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined -- that was accurate enough to earn a Mostly True from PolitiFact. This time, though, he allowed small but significant changes to creep in and weaken its accuracy.Romney confused public debt and gross debt; he failed to clarify that he was talking about the debt accruing during the entirety of Obama\u2019s first term; and he misplaced the word \"almost\" in a way that makes it hard to parse his claim. If we use the public debt figure and put the word \"almost\" where the Romney campaign says it should be, \"almost\" might apply to one of three comparisons -- one in which the debt is about four-fifths of the way to equalling totals under previous presidents. That\u2019s a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

One post shared on Facebook, however, claims South Carolina recently lowered its legal drinking age to 18. \u201cThey just lowered drinking age to 18 in South Carolina!!\u201d reads the post.\n\nContrary to this claim, South Carolina has not lowered its drinking age. Check Your Fact searched the South Carolina General Assembly\u2019swebsitebut found no record that any bill lowering the drinking age had passed. Likewise, there are nopress releasesfrom South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster about the legal drinking age having been changed.\n\nThe viral claim appears to have stemmed from news that, according to NBC-affiliateWMBF News, South Carolina State Rep. Todd Rutherford had pre-filed abillon Nov. 10 to lower the minimum drinking age for beer and wine in the state to 18 years old. However, the proposed legislation will not come up for consideration until the state legislature reconvenes in January 2022, according to local news outletWPDE ABC15.\n\n\u201cThis is a personal freedom issue,\u201d Rutherford toldWMBF News. \u201cIf you are old enough to fight for our country, if you\u2019re old enough to vote, if you\u2019re old enough to sign on for thousands of dollars of student loans for a college education, then you are old enough to have a drink.\u201d(RELATED: Did A Survey Find 38% Of Americans Won\u2019t Drink Corona Beer Over Coronavirus Concerns?)\n\nThis is not the first time South Carolina legislators have attempted to amend the state\u2019s drinking age laws. In 2008, a former South Carolina State Rep. Fletcher Smith introduced abillto reduce the drinking age in the state from 21 to 18 for all military service members, according toCBS News.

        "doc": "CLAIM \u201cBuy yourselves charcoal activated tablets [\u2026] it will counteract most date rape drugs\u201d more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Facebook users, Facebook, 4 Sep. 2019 DETAILS Unsupported: Activated charcoal is used in medical settings when gastrointestinal decontamination is recommended. However, the dose of activated charcoal in tablets is too low to have an impact on date rape drugs. Activated charcoal would also need to be taken soon after the date rape drug is ingested to have an effect, because many of these drugs are rapidly absorbed by the body. Potentially harmful: Individuals who believe they have been drugged should seek medical attention. Taking an activated charcoal tablet may give them a false sense of reassurance. KEY TAKE AWAY Date rape drugs are substances that compromise an individual\u2019s ability to give consent and are associated with drug-facilitated sexual assault. Activated charcoal binds to some poisons and medical drugs. In medical settings, it is given in poisoning cases where gastrointestinal decontamination is recommended. However, it is unlikely that charcoal activated tablets will work for date rape drugs because the amount of charcoal in these tablets is too low and charcoal needs to be taken soon after ingestion of a substance to be effective. Furthermore, activated charcoal does not work against alcohol, the most common date rape drug. Individuals who have been given a date rape drug should seek medical attention rather than rely on an activated charcoal tablet. FULL CLAIM: \u201cGuys please buy yourselves Charcoal activated tablets & carry them with you to any gathering or night club. Should you feel like you aren\u2019t yourself or out of place, drink one tablet & it will counteract most date rape drugs.\u201d REVIEW Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) refers to any sexual assault where alcohol or drugs were used to compromise an individual\u2019s ability to give consent. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) defines two ways a DFSA can occur. In the first, the perpetrator takes advantage of someone\u2019s voluntary use of drugs or alcohol. In the second, the perpetrator intentionally forces the victim to consume drugs or alcohol either with or without their knowledge. In 2008, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), an agency in the European Union, released a technical data sheet on DFSAs[1]. According to the EMCDDA, reporting on DFSA\u2019s suggests that over the last 10 years there had been an increase in the use of alcohol and drugs to incapacitate victims of sexual assault. The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) released in 2018, reported that six percent of assault victims had been drugged by the offender. A number of drugs, known as date rape drugs, are commonly associated with DFSAs. The most commonly associated substance is alcohol[1]. According to RAINN, perpetrators may also use \u201cprescription drugs like sleeping aids, anxiety medication, muscle relaxers and tranquilizers.\u201d Two of the most commonly mentioned street or club drugs include the sedative flunitrazepam\u2013also known as Rohypnol or roofies\u2013 and the central nervous system depressant Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Much has been written about what precautions individuals can take to avoid DFSAs \u2013 for instance, don\u2019t leave your drink unattended. While, advice on what to do if you believe you\u2019ve ingested a date rape drug involves seeking medical care. For this reason, it\u2019s not surprising that a Facebook post from 2019 claiming that charcoal activated tablets can counteract date rape drugs went viral again in June 2021. As of 23 June 2021, the post was shared over 135,000 times. Although activated charcoal is used in many instances to treat poisonings, individuals who have been given a date rape drug, should seek medical attention rather than rely on an activated charcoal tablet. Toxicologists who reviewed this claim for Health Feedback concurred that activated charcoal tablets would probably not work against date rape drugs for a number of reasons we explain below. What is activated charcoal? Charcoal, the byproduct of heating wood, is activated by steaming with really hot water or acid. This creates a number of pores on the surface of the charcoal, increasing its surface area to bind to poisons and other substances. Many substances, including chemical poisons and medical drugs, are adsorbed by activated charcoal[2]. What this means is that, these substances are attracted to the surface of charcoal and bind to it. It\u2019s for this reason that many water filtration systems use activated charcoal to remove impurities such as chlorine. Activated charcoal isn\u2019t only used in filtration systems. \u201cActivated charcoal is often given orally in the emergency treatment of poisoning,\u201d explained Kent Olson, a retired clinical professor of medicine and pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco [read Olson\u2019s comment in full below]. \u201cCharcoal works by binding to ingested drugs and poisons, preventing or reducing absorption of the substance into the bloodstream.\u201d Activated charcoal is the most frequently used method of gastrointestinal decontamination in the developed world[3]. However, though activated charcoal is sometimes called an \u201cuniversal antidote,\u201d this characterization is incorrect; many substances are not fully adsorbed or not adsorbed at all by activated charcoal[2,3]. The effectiveness of activated charcoal, Olson explained, depends on a number of factors: \u201chow readily it binds to the ingested poison; the amount of charcoal given compared to the amount of ingested toxic substance; and the time delay between when the poison was ingested and the administration of charcoal.\u201d The realization of the limitations of activated charcoal has resulted in a decrease of its use in acute poison patients[3]. In 1999, poison centers in the U.S. recommended single dose activated charcoal over 136,000 times; by 2013, that number had decreased to around 50,000[3]. Can activated charcoal counteract date rape drugs? \u201cCharcoal does not counteract or reverse the effects of the drug,\u201d Olson pointed out. \u201cIt can only reduce its absorption\u2013so ideally it should be given before the offending drug or very soon after.\u201d When it comes to date rape drugs, Tobias Zellner, a medical doctor at the Technical University of Munich, believes the benefits of activated charcoal are minimal. \u201cThe problem is that most date rape drugs (like GHB) are odorless, tasteless and have a rapid onset. At the point of time when the victim notices the first symptoms, a major part of the drug has already been absorbed, so taking activated charcoal would not have a relevant effect anymore,\u201d he explained [read Zellner\u2019s comment in full below]. Olson also mentioned the importance of timing. \u201cSmall volumes of the date rape substance, as a crushed pill or liquid, are usually taken up into the body fairly quickly and are probably completely absorbed within about 20-30 minutes, so if the charcoal is going to have any effect it would need to be given immediately.\u201d Activated charcoal would also have no impact on alcohol, which is the substance most commonly associated with DFSAs. It \u201cis not effectively adsorbed to charcoal, so if alcohol is the only intoxicant the charcoal is worthless,\u201d said Olson. Both Olson and Zellner mentioned that the dosing of activated charcoal is another issue, with the amount of activated charcoal in tablets being too low to have an effect. \u201cThe amount of charcoal in each activated charcoal tablet is relatively small (150-300 mg per tablet); to take a dose equivalent to what is commonly used in a hospital emergency department would require about 150-200 tablets,\u201d explained Olson. Another issue is the formulation of activated charcoal. \u201cThe preferred formulation is powder in a suspension with water,\u201d explained Zellner. If activated charcoal is taken as a tablet, \u201cit will never reach a proper elimination.\u201d Lastly, date rape drugs can cause reduced or loss of consciousness and coma. These, Zellner said, \u201care strict contraindications for taking activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration.\u201d Accidental aspiration of activated charcoal can cause respiratory distress[4]. In hospital settings, when activated charcoal is given to a patient who can\u2019t swallow, it\u2019s delivered via a stomach tube [2]. Conclusion Though activated charcoal is the most used method of gastrointestinal decontamination in the developed world, an activated charcoal tablet would not be useful to counteract date rape drugs in the manner described in the Facebook post. The dose of activated charcoal in tablets is too low and the formulation is not ideal. The activated charcoal tablets would need to be taken soon after the date rape drug, which can be hard because many of the drugs associated with DFSAs are odorless and tasteless, and are absorbed quickly by the body. Lastly, activated charcoal would have no effect on alcohol, which is the drug most commonly associated with DFSAs and does not adsorb to activated charcoal. As Zellner said in his review of this claim: \u201cI would strongly advise against taking activated charcoal and feeling falsely reassured, but rather directly go to the next hospital or call an ambulance.\u201d SCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK Kent Olson, Clinical Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy (retired), University of California, San Francisco: Activated charcoal is often given orally in the emergency treatment of poisoning. Charcoal works by binding to ingested drugs and poisons, preventing or reducing absorption of the substance into the bloodstream. Its effectiveness depends on several factors: how readily it binds to the ingested poison; the amount of charcoal given compared to the amount of ingested toxic substance; and the time delay between when the poison was ingested and the administration of charcoal. Charcoal does not counteract or reverse the effects of the drug, it can only reduce its absorption \u2014 so ideally it should be given before the offending drug or very soon after. There are a number of so-called \u201cdate rape\u201d drugs that can induce drowsiness or coma, making the victim incapacitated to resist or recall a sexual assault. These include gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) and other benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), clonidine, and many others. Perhaps the most common of these substances is alcohol, which can be used alone or in combination with other date rape drugs to cause intoxication. For all of these the effect of the drug is entirely dependent on the dose taken. If charcoal can reduce the dose of the drug that is absorbed into the body, could taking charcoal tablets after you suspect someone has given you a date rape drug prevent you from becoming intoxicated? Probably not, for the following reasons: Alcohol, the most common date-rape drug, is not effectively adsorbed to charcoal, so if alcohol is the only intoxicant the charcoal is worthless. The amount of charcoal in each activated charcoal tablet is relatively small (150-300 mg per tablet); to take a dose equivalent to what is commonly used in a hospital emergency department would require about 150-200 tablets. Small volumes of the date rape substance, as a crushed pill or liquid, are usually taken up into the body fairly quickly and are probably completely absorbed within about 20-30 minutes, so if the charcoal is going to have any effect it would need to be given immediately. \u00b7 While it is possible that taking several tablets of charcoal before ingesting a suspect date-rape drug might conceivably have some protective value, remember that it would have no effect on any alcohol ingested and would have only limited benefit for other drugs, depending on the specific drug. I am not aware of any well-documented studies showing a benefit of prophylactic charcoal in such a scenario. Tobias Zellner, Medical Doctor, Technical University of Munich: The use of activated charcoal to counteract date rape drugs seems to be minimal in my opinion. In theory, activated charcoal would stop some of the absorption of the most common rape drugs (although there are multiple substances) in the stomach. The problem is that most date rape drugs (like GHB) are odorless, tasteless and have a rapid onset. At the point of time, when the victim notices the first symptoms, the major part of the drug has already been absorbed, so taking activated charcoal would not have a relevant effect anymore. Furthermore, one of the symptoms of date rape drugs is reduced consciousness or coma, which are strict contraindications for taking activated charcoal because of the risk of aspiration. Another problem is the dosing of activated charcoal and the formulation. One tablet \u2013 as claimed in the post \u2013 is not nearly enough and in tablet form it will never reach a proper elimination, the preferred formulation is powder in a suspension with water. Overall I see no practical use for activated charcoal to counteract date rape drugs, certainly not in the way described in the post. So I would strongly advise against taking activated charcoal and feeling falsely reassured but rather directly go to the next hospital or call an ambulance. REFERENCES",

As the camera shifted focus from Shrivastav on the top floor of the studio to Tripathi on the ground, viewers were told that eight family members associated with Tablighi Jamaat tested positive for coronavirus in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Khargone. The anchors contacted channel correspondent Satyavijay for further details. He blamed Noor Mohammad for spreading the infection to his family and claimed that Mohammad had visited Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi after returning from a foreign trip. He subsequently came back to Khargone where he did not inform local authorities that he showed symptoms for COVID-19, added Satyavijay further stating that Noor Mohammad died on March 28. He also said that Mohammad\u2019s mother passed away. \u201cJamaat is the root of coronavirus cases in Madhya Pradesh,\u201d declared the channel correspondent adding, \u201cHad Noor Mohammad informed on time, he would have perhaps been kept in isolation.\u201d Shrivatsav concurred with Satyavijay\u2019s opinion and termed members of Tablighi Jamaat \u201cshameless\u201d \u2013 a word that was continually flashed on TV screens along with similar words such as \u2018badtameez (ill-mannered)\u2019, \u2018behudi (stupidity)\u2019 and \u2018besharam jamaati (shameless jamaati)\u2019. ANI tweeted on the case on April 8. The news agency quoted Khargone district magistrate Gopal Chandra Dad as saying, \u201cThe attendee and his mother died due to the disease.\u201d Eight members of a family have tested positive in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh as they came in contact with an infected member who attended Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi last month. The attendee & his mother have died due to the disease: District Magistrate GC Dad pic.twitter.com/eDk7EQ2jqp \u2014 ANI (@ANI) April 8, 2020 FACT-CHECK While Noor Mohammad indeed visited Nizamuddin Markaz after a foreign trip (South Africa) and later returned to Khargone, he is not dead. Alt News spoke with Mohammad who informed that he and his wife returned to Khargone on March 21 and his entire family was examined by district health officials in their residence on March 24. \u201cI had an on-and-off fever since the day I began travelling back to MP from Delhi. I had informed the health officials about my trip to South Africa which they were already aware of since the local administration had kept a list of all people with a history of foreign travel.\u201d None of the family members was admitted to the hospital at the time since they did not run a fever. \u201cMy fever wasn\u2019t continuous and it used to act up at night. It is possible that my temperature was recorded normal as the health officials had visited during the day,\u201d said Mohammad adding that he was advised home-quarantine. It is worthwhile to note that testing strategies have been evolving in the country as the disease is progressing. According to earlier guidelines by the Ministry of Health, testing was mostly limited to symptomatic people with a travel history or close contacts of positive cases. This explains why health officials were more concerned about Mohammad\u2019s trip to South Africa. His visit to Nizamuddin was of little consequence on March 24 when the area was not identified as a hotspot. On March 31, reports came pouring in about a cluster of cases from the Tablighi Jamaat event held last month. \u201cI contacted the doctors again and told them that I\u2019m coming down to the hospital with my wife,\u201d said Mohammad. District Magistrate Gopal Chandra Dad also informed Alt News that Mohammad had visited the district hospital on March 31, after the news about Nizamuddin Markaz broke out. This is when the couple\u2019s samples were collected and they were admitted to the hospital. \u201cTheir results came out on April 4. Noor Mohammad tested positive while his wife tested negative,\u201d informed Mohammad\u2019s nephew Yasir Pathan. Below is a circular by the district administration which was issued after Mohammad and another patient from Khargone, Lalit Patidar, was tested positive on April 4. The circular informs that both their residences are epicentres and areas within 3 km radium are to be regarded as containment areas. On April 9, Mohammad\u2019s nephew Pathan filed a complaint with Khargone police on Republic Bharat\u2019s misreport that Mohammad had passed away due to the infection on March 28. \u201cMohammad was transferred to Indore\u2019s MRTB Hospital on April 4 where he was kept till April 11. He was discharged on April 12 after he tested negative twice,\u201d said Pathan who sent us a video recorded by Mohammad from the hospital after he heard that rumours of his death were floating in the media. Dainik Bhaskar had reported about Mohammad\u2019s discharge on April 13. A video was recorded at the time of his discharge where Mohammad can be heard saying that he has fully recovered. Seven recovered coronavirus patients were discharged from MRTB Hospital on April 12. Indore Commissioner posted about the recovery and also shared a photograph of the discharged patients. The man in a yellow kurta is Noor Mohammad. It is noteworthy that eight members of Mohammad\u2019s family had tested positive for coronavirus. Below is their test result which was released was April 7. Among them is Kharshid Bee, Mohammad\u2019s 70-year-old mother, who passed away on April 4. Pathan said that she suffered a stroke at home. The same was reported by Dainik Bhaskar on April 5. However, DM Gopal Chandra Das said that the local administration is regarding her demise as a coronavirus death since she was tested positive after she passed away. The broadcast that should have been Noor Mohammad has been staying at the Khargone isolation ward since his discharge from MRTB Hospital, Indore. Mohammad told us that he landed in Delhi from South Africa on the morning of March 19. He claimed that he was asked to fill out two forms at Delhi airport which were essentially a questionnaire inquiring about his health. \u201cThe form had questions like \u2018Do you have a fever?\u2019, \u2018Do you have a cough and cold?\u2019 I was perfectly fine at the time so marked \u2018no\u2019 in all places. I wasn\u2019t examined,\u201d he said. When asked if he was advised home isolation at the airport he replied in the negative. Mohammad and his wife left for Madhya Pradesh on March 20. They boarded a night train from Delhi and this was when he first began feeling sick. \u201cI thought that it was perhaps because of the hectic journey. I took a tablet for fever,\u201d Mohammad told us. The couple reached Indore at noon on March 21 and finally arrived at Khargone after a three-hour bus journey. None of these essential details was a part of Republic Bharat\u2019s broadcast. The channel accused Mohammad of hiding his travel history to Nizamuddin and declared that he died on March 28. This itself is bizarre. Nizamuddin emerged as a coronavirus hotspot only on March 31. Noor Mohammad\u2019s story was grossly trivialised by Republic Bharat for mass consumption. We use the word \u2018trivialised\u2019 because the case was not given the needed coverage that could have helped local authorities in contact tracing. According to Dainik Bhaskar, Mohammad and his wife were on a religious tour since January. Their trip was planned before coronavirus was declared a crisis by the central government. End January: Mohammad and his wife went to Mumbai to attend a Jamaat meet. February: The couple left for a religious tour In South Africa for close to 45 days. March 19: Noor Mohammad and his wife travel from South Africa to Delhi. March 20: The couple spend the day in Delhi where they visit Nizamuddin Markaz and board a train to Indore at night. Mohammed informed us that he had started feeling under the weather during the journey. March 21: They reach Indore at noon and take a three-hour bus to Khargone. March 22: Mohammad was experiencing an on-and-off fever. His nephew Yasir Pathan told us that Mohammad also had a slight cough. Mohammad visited a general physician who gave him medicines for fever. March 24: Health officials visited Mohammad\u2019s residence. The entire family\u2019s temperature was checked and none of them had a fever. Mohammad was asked to self-quarantine. March 31: Upon hearing the news of Nizamuddin recognised as a COVID-19 hotspot, Mohammad and his wife visited the district hospital where their samples were collected and they were admitted. April 4: Mohammad tested positive for coronavirus while his wife tested negative. Mohammad was transferred to MRTB Hospital, Indore. The same day his mother died of a stroke. April 7: Eight family members including Mohammad\u2019s mother test positive for coronavirus. April 12: Mohammad was discharged from MRTB Hospital after testing negative twice. April 13: He has since been quarantined at the Khargon district hospital. Conclusion Republic Bharat\u2019s broadcast was erroneous (to put it lightly) on multiple counts. The channel first claimed that Noor Mohammad died which is obviously untrue because we spoke with him on the phone. It further said that Mohammad concealed his travel history. This too is false. When Mohammad landed at Delhi international airport, he filled out a self-declaration form. Alt News verified the questions in the form as mentioned by Mohammad with copies of the form uploaded online by others. Mohammad was not screened at the airport because he did not show symptoms for coronavirus. After returning to Khargone, Mohammad and his entire family were examined by medical officers on March 24. The officers visited his residence because they were aware of his foreign trip. No one from the family was admitted, including Mohammad\u2019s parents aged 70 plus, as their temperatures were normal. On March 31, when Nizamuddin was identified as a COVID-19 hotspot, Mohammad and his wife went to the district hospital where their samples were collected and they were admitted. None of the other family members was given a test. On April 4, Mohammad tested positive and his wife tested negative. Mohammad was shifted to Indore. His elderly mother passed away the same day. Samples of eight family members, including the mother, were subsequently collected. On April 7, all of them tested positive. Mohammad followed all the required protocol \u2013 self-declaration at the airport, cooperation with medical workers during the home visit and declaration of his visit to the Markaz after it emerged as a hotspot.

        "claim": "A February 2013 speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin demanded that Muslim immigrants speak Russian and conform to Russian culture.",
        "doc": "An April 2013 item purported to reproduce a speech given by Russian president Vladimir Putin to the State Duma (the lower house of Russia\u2019s Federal Assembly) in which he demanded that minorities living in Russia (particularly Muslims) speak Russian and conform to Russian culture and laws and urged the Russian legislature to \u201chave in mind the Russian national interest first\u201d in order to avoid Muslims\u2019 \u201ctaking over Russia.\u201d At the conclusion of this speech he reportedly received a \u201cfive-minute standing ovation\u201d from the gathered members of the assembly: On February 04, 2013, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, addressed the Duma, (Russian Parliament), and gave a speech about the tensions with minorities in Russia : \u201cIn Russia live Russians. Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims then we advise them to go to those places where that\u2019s the state law. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell \u2018discrimination\u2019. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture. We had better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim minorities are not Russians. The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a five minute standing ovation. No evidence exists documenting that President Putin gave any such speech, however. The Speeches and Transcripts section of the official Russian presidential web site recorded no Putin speech of that nature on 4 February 2013 (or any other date up to April 2013, when this item first appeared), nor did a record or mention of anything like this speech appear elsewhere on that site or in any news accounts (Russian or foreign) published since then. Moreover, this item is highly reminiscent (and appears to be a variant form of) an opinion piece originally written by an U.S. Air Force veteran shortly after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, versions of which have falsely been attributed to various world leaders (primarily the prime ministers of Australia and the UK) in the intervening years. President Putin did, during his introductory remarks to a meeting of the Board of the Federal Migration Service in January 2012, speak words somewhat similar to the sentiments expressed in the item reproduced above, but with much more moderated language and a much less inflammatory tone: On the whole, the adaptation of guest workers is a separate and comprehensive issue. We must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society, learn Russian and, of course, respect our culture and traditions and abide by Russian law. In this regard, I believe that the decision to make learning the Russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded. To do so, we will need to carry out major organisational work and introduce corresponding legislative amendments. I\u2019d like to ask the Federal Migration Service and other departments to submit specific proposals to the government. These proposals should be openly discussed with ethnic minorities as well as public and religious organisations. This should be mandatory for all guest workers regardless of their future employment.",

        "doc": "Curious about how Snopes\u2019 writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We\u2019ve collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. In January 2022, a widely circulated Facebook post claimed that a person\u2019s \u201cmost productive years\u201d are between the ages of 60 and 80, according to an unreferenced study published in the peer-reviewed and credible research publication New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). As of this writing, the post had received more than 68,000 shares. In addition to similar iterations on social media, Snopes readers also sent our newsroom screengrabs from an email chain with the subject line, \u201cThe brain of an elderly person\u201d that claimed older people have \u201cmore brilliant brains and achieve more than younger people\u201d: In particular, the post claimed that the \u201cmost productive age of a person is from 60 to 70 years,\u201d that the \u201csecond most productive human stage is the age from 70 to 80 years old,\u201d and that the third \u201cmost productive\u201d time is between the ages of 50 and 60. Before that, the person was said to have \u201cnot reached his peak.\u201d \u201cTherefore, if you are 60, 70 or 80 years old, you are at the best level of your life,\u201d claimed the poster. Snopes dug through the NEJM publications available and were not able to find evidence of such a study having been conducted or published by the journal. To confirm, we reached out to the publication directly and were told that no such article has been published by NEJM. \u201cThe NEJM does not use the numbering system cited in the Facebook post [N.Engl.J.Med. 70,389 (2018)],\u201d NEJM editorial coordinator Grace Hansen-Dewa told Snopes. There was neither an \u201cissue 70\u201d nor an \u201cissue 389\u201d published in 2018, she said, nor were these the page numbers of articles related to the topic. \u201cIn 2018, the article found on page 70 is \u201cFavism and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency\u201d, which begins on page 60. The article found on page 389 is the end of \u201cCase 3-2018: A 5-Month-Old Boy with Hypoglycemia\u201d, which begins on page 381. Because the study in question never existed, we have rated this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d However, there is scientific work that has been conducted in the past to determine when a person might be most productive. While there is extensive literature on various life stages and their measures of productivity, each depends on a variety of factors including whether you\u2019re looking at physical, mental, emotional, or financial parameters. Without knowing exactly what such parameters were used to make the original poster\u2019s case, it is difficult to further determine when a person may be at their peak potential. Some research finds that the later years may be the best time in a person\u2019s life. In a 2015 TedX talk, real estate developer and primary spokesperson for Halftime Institute, Lloyd further argued that there is \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that the second half of a person\u2019s life could be the \u201cvery best season\u201d of life. But there\u2019s also evidence arguing the contrary. In the comments section of a 2019 NEJM Facebook post that featured the issue cited in the misleading claim, several users made mention of the viral post, some of whom shared research they had found to suggest some there may be some truth to a person\u2019s better years occurring later in life. \u201cHistorians of science have generally concluded that scientific output tends to rise steeply in the twenties and thirties, peak in the late thirties or early forties, and then trail off slowly through later years,\u201d wrote one such study published in 2012 to determine how an aging demographic may hold implications for societal productivity. A commentary published in a 2008 further argued that the \u201cdeterminants of productivity vary by age\u201d and their relative importance on measuring productivity at various stages in one\u2019s lifetime. \u201cGiven that experience has a reasonably strong effect on productivity, the peak productivity potential occurs in ages 35-44,\u201d noted the study. There were some other dubious and somewhat vague claims that we wanted to address from the Facebook post as well, the first being that the \u201caverage age of dads is 76.\u201d It is unclear if at what stage of fatherhood the original poster meant, but a 2017 study published in the journal Human Reproduction found that the average age of a dad at their child\u2019s birth is just under 31 years old \u2014 and about 1 in 10 fathers will be 40. The claim in question is a great lesson in media literacy, whereby it is important to pay attention to context. For example, the original poster claimed that most Nobel Prize winners were 62, but it does not specify whether that is the age at which they received the prize or the age at which they conducted the work they were awarded for. The average age of a Nobel Prize laureate, a proxy to study at which age scientist produce their most groundbreaking work, is at least 65 and mostly over 72, according to the BBC. (Prize winners were all also mostly men, which could say more about societal privilege than age itself.) Research conducted in 2010 looked at the age at which invention occurs and found that the average is 39. In short, there are a wide variety of factors that may influence a person\u2019s \u201cproductivity\u201d and how one might set about measuring it. While there is some evidence to suggest certain gauges of productivity occur later in life, other research finds that a person may be more productive in other arenas of life at various stages, such as financial earnings, parenthood, or an individual\u2019s own measure of productivity.

Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. In February 2022, Facebook users shared what appeared to be a phishing scam falsely promising a free meal for two at the seafood chain restaurant Red Lobster. The post contains text that claims to be sourced from Kim Lopdrup, supposedly the \u201cnew CEO of Red Lobster,\u201d offering a \u201cvoucher to get meal for two at any Red Lobster for lunch or dinner.\u201d The catch of course is that in order to get said voucher, Facebook users must click on a link, share the post, and comment. Several indicators point to the Facebook post being a scam. For starters, Kim Lopdrup isn\u2019t the \u201cnew CEO\u201d of Red Lobster. He became the company\u2019s CEO in 2014 and in 2021 announced his plans to retire. Furthermore, the post isn\u2019t being shared by official Red Lobster social media accounts \u2014 it\u2019s being shared by an unofficial Facebook account called Red Lobster Fans that appears to have been created solely for the purpose of sharing the above post. The account appears to generate an automatic response anytime someone posts a comment, urging them to complete the process of clicking, sharing, and commenting. A typical Facebook scam involves the perpetrators offering a deal that seems too good to be true, then urging viewers to click a link, comment, and share the scam post. They are often phishing scams that seek to illicitly collect personal information from victims. A spokesperson for Red Lobster confirmed in an email to Snopes that the offer is fake, and the company has been working with Facebook to get the posts removed.

In replying, he changed the focus, making what is essentially a definitive claim about national polls on possible presidential contenders. \"No, I mean, in the end, any poll right now is ridiculous,\" the governor said. \"You look over the past four or five elections, people who poll high at the beginning are not the people who end up being the nominees.\" Given that Walker ranks ninth out of 11 potential GOP presidential candidates, according to Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling averages, such a claim, if true, could mean a run isn\u2019t necessarily a lost cause. Of course, the 2016 election is still two years away, most voters aren\u2019t paying close attention and the potential candidates will do plenty of jockeying in the meantime. \"Campaigns certainly matter,\" pollster Gary Langer, who directs ABC News polling, told us. \"However, being an early leader has its advantages.\" Wisconsin poll The poll alluded to by the Fox interviewer was an exit poll of Wisconsin voters who had just cast ballots in the Nov. 4, 2014 mid-term elections. Amid a wave of GOP wins nationwide, Walker was re-elected that day by a margin of 52 percent to 47 percent. But only 42 percent of the state voters in the exit poll, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said Walker would make a good president. Walker\u2019s evidence We asked Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrickfor evidence to back Walker\u2019s statement about early polling in presidential races. She noted some instances in which an early front-runner did not get nominated for president, including two in 2008. Hillary Clinton, who held a big lead in early polling, lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama; and Rudy Giuliani, who dueled with John McCain in early polling, lost the GOP nomination to McCain. But Walker\u2019s claim takes us all the way back to the 1996 presidential election. So let\u2019s get a fuller account of early polling and who the nominees turned out to be. Early presidential-preference surveys To avoid comparing apples and oranges, we looked at polling only for open seats; in other words, polls for nomination races in which an incumbent president was not seeking his party\u2019s nomination for another term. In 2016, that\u2019s the playing field for both parties. We relied primarily on polling data provided by researcher Kathleen Weldon from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research and work that FiveThirtyEight.com blogger Nate Silver did in 2011 for the New York Times. Both assembled data from major national polls. As we\u2019ll see, despite Walker's sweeping claim, there are a number of examples that don\u2019t support him. 1996: Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was the clear Republican front-runner and he won the GOP nomination. Roper data showed him well in the lead in nearly every early poll. And Silver\u2019s measure found Dole had a 39-point edge over Texas Sen. Phil Gramm in polls taken from January to June of 1995. Dole lost the election to Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton. 2000: Both parties had clear early front-runners and both of those candidates became the nominees. Roper said George W. Bush led all other Republican contenders by September 1997 and Vice President Al Gore was well ahead of other Democratic contenders five months earlier. In Silver\u2019s averaging -- for polling done from January to June 1999 -- Bush led Dole\u2019s wife, North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole, by 28 points while Gore led his nearest rival, New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, by 33 points. Bush edged Gore in the election. 2004: Gore was the clear front-runner in early polls, well ahead of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, but he decided nearly two years before the election not to run. Later, in early 2003, Kerry and Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman were tied in the polls, according to the Pew Research Center. Kerry eventually claimed the Democratic nomination. Kerry lost the election to Bush, who won a second term. 2008: The results in this election were mixed. As we noted, Hillary Clinton was the clear front-runner, initially polling well ahead of Kerry and North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, before losing the Democratic nomination to Obama. Later, she led Obama by 15 points in Silver's averaging of the poll results from January through June 2007. On the Republican side, as we noted, Guiliani and McCain polled well early. Roper said Giuliani, the former New York mayor, led McCain, the Arizona senator, in most polls in 2005, but only by a few points.. McCain lost the election to Obama. 2012: One of the candidates who polled well early won the GOP nomination. Roper said polls from 2009 revealed a tight race among former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, before Romney claimed the Republican nomination. Romney lost to Obama, who won a second term. So how does this all shake out? Five contenders -- Bob Dole in 1996, Bush and Gore in 2000, McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 -- all scored high in the earliest polls and went on to win their party\u2019s nomination. Our rating Walker said that in \"the past four or five\" presidential elections, \"people who poll high at the beginning are not the people who end up being the nominees.\" Some who polled high since 1996 didn\u2019t become the nominee, of course, but that isn\u2019t enough evidence to back Walker\u2019s flat statement. Indeed, five contenders who polled well early did, in fact, become the presidential nominee. For a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"Today, when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security.\"",
        "doc": "During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Social Security took center stage, in large part because of a dispute between former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry over Perry's comments about the retirement program. But fellow candidate Herman Cain, the former CEO of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, raised another point about Social Security: He touted the performance of a plan that allowed employees of Galveston County, Texas, to opt out of Social Security and participate in a separate retirement plan.The topic came up when moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Cain, \"Are you with Gov. Perry that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme?\"Cain responded, \"I don't care what you call it, it's broken. And here's my solution. Start with optional personal retirement accounts. In 1981, the Galveston County employees, they opted out because that was a very short window of opportunity. They took it. Today, when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security.\"It wasn\u2019t the first time Cain had touted the Galveston plan. During a Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., Cain said something similar:\"The city of Galveston, they opted out of the Social Security system way back in the '70s,\" Cain said. \"And now, they retire with a whole lot more money. Why? For a real simple reason -- they have an account with their money on it. What I'm simply saying is we've got to restructure the program using a personal retirement account option in order to eventually make it solvent.\"We rated Cain\u2019s previous statement about the Galveston plan Half True. His wording this time was different, but his general notion was similar -- that the Galveston plan provides its participants with benefits superior to those they would have had under Social Security.First, some background on the Galveston program, which is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. (The federal government banned such moves by local governments in 1983.)In 1981, employees of Galveston County -- as well as those in two adjoining Texas counties, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted, after lengthy presentations and discussions, to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that the plan only affects employees of the county government -- not everyone who lives in Galveston County, as some viewers might take away from Cain\u2019s comment.)Participants would contribute to their retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds would be invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process.The Alternate Plan, as it is called, was designed to supplement a separate, existing, defined-contribution pension plan known as the Texas County and District Retirement System. The Alternate Plan\u2019s benefits are not indexed for inflation (a key difference from Social Security -- more on that below) and while each participant is assigned an individual account, the employee is not able to control investment decisions.In recent years, as various politicians have floated ideas to partially privatize Social Security, the Galveston plan has received an unusual amount of public attention. However, the primary statistics available to gauge Cain\u2019s claim are imperfect, since they are more than a decade old.Judging which plan provides a better payout requires constructing models for various types of employees, accounting for variables such as income, the length and consistency of job tenure, marital status and the number and age of dependents. So comparing the two plans is a complex undertaking, and the most thorough independent examinations of the question -- a pair of 1999 studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Social Security Administration -- do not appear to have been updated in the past dozen years.We\u2019ll first explain what GAO and SSA concluded in 1999, then look at what variables must be taken into account before applying their 12-year-old conclusions to today.As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas summarized in an item published in December 2010, participants who had higher earnings and fewer or no dependents generally fared better under the Galveston plan, particularly over the near term. But workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security.This stems from the plans\u2019 divergent designs. The Galveston plan is somewhat analogous to a 401(k) plan -- that is, a plan designed to encourage workers to save for retirement -- rather than a social insurance, or safety-net, program like Social Security.\"Social Security is a social insurance program designed, in part, to provide a basic level of retirement income to help retired workers, disabled workers and their dependents and survivors stay out of poverty,\" GAO wrote in 1999. As a result, GAO said, Social Security benefits \"are tilted to provide relatively higher benefits to low-wage earners\" than they would have received based on what they put into the system.There is no such redistributive mechanism in the Alternate Plan. If you have a higher salary and put more money into the system, you\u2019ll get more out of it -- perhaps even more than Social Security would provide, GAO and SSA concluded. But if you are on the low end of the income scale, Social Security will give you a relatively better payout at retirement, compared with the Alternate Plan.There\u2019s another important factor to note. Because the Alternate Plan lacks inflation protection -- unlike Social Security, which increases benefits annually if there\u2019s inflation in consumer prices -- the studies found a serious risk that Alternate Plan beneficiaries will fare worse over time than if they had received Social Security and its built-in cost-of-living increases. (The specific scenarios outlined in the studies are highly varied; readers who want more details should read the reports directly.)The takeaway from the GAO and SSA studies is that the Galveston plan can be better than Social Security -- if you\u2019re better off and if you fall into certain specific demographic categories. For many workers, especially those who are paid less, Social Security provides more.This result doesn\u2019t directly conflict with Cain\u2019s statement, but it does undermine the sweeping certitude with which he said that \"when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security.\"\"It's a great plan if you have worked under the plan for many years, if you do not die and leave any dependents, if you are not divorced from someone covered in the plan and if you are not interested in having your retirement income stream protected against inflation,\" said Eric Kingson, a professor at Syracuse University's School of Social Work and a longtime skeptic of the plan. \"Short-term workers who leave the plan receive little if any benefits for their work and do not have their years under the Galveston Plan covered by Social Security. Low-income working persons do not receive anything approaching the kind of protection they receive under Social Security.\"Keith Brainard, the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed that the Galveston plan is better for some types of workers, including those with long tenures.But the \"problem,\" he said, \"lies in Cain\u2019s implication that Social Security should be a wealth-producing vehicle, when that\u2019s not what it\u2019s supposed to be. Social Security is supposed to be old-age insurance. That should be the emphasis of the program, not \u2018retiring with a lot more money.\u2019\"As we noted, the GAO and SSA studies are old. How do they hold up? As it turns out, they may bolster or even strengthen the case for Social Security.The 1999 studies were conducted at a time of higher returns in the marketplace. The Galveston plan invests conservatively -- by design and from the beginning -- in annuity contracts with a guaranteed rate of return, rather than stocks. So the Galveston system is insulated from much market volatility.Still, even these safer financial vehicles have seen ramped-down returns in the current economic climate. Because of prevailing low interest rates, the contracts now provide the minimum rate of return that was negotiated as a floor in 1981 -- either 3.75 percent or 4 percent annually, said Rick Gornto, president of First Financial Benefits Inc., who has operated the Galveston plan for 30 years. That\u2019s lower than the 1999 GAO and SSA studies had projected.And that\u2019s notable, because when the 1999 studies came out, plan supporters criticized the reports for assuming lower returns than the plan had produced historically, thus unfairly selling the plan short compared to Social Security.\"These studies assumed a low 4 percent return, which is the minimum rate of return on annuities guaranteed by the insurance companies,\" wrote Judge Ray Holbrook, who oversaw the creation and administration of the Galveston plan, and Alcestis \"Cooky\" Oberg in a 2005 paper for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank that has been a longtime supporter of the plan. Holbrook and Oberg wrote that as of 2005, the average annual rate of return had been \"about 6.5 percent over 24 years.\"Our reading of the SSA study is that they actually assumed a 5.55 percent rate of return for the Galveston plan. The figure used in the GAO study was not specified.Either way, the rates of return for the Alternate Plan are either equal to or lower than the 1999 studies had assumed. That would either bolster the 1999 conclusions or put the Alternate Plan at a disadvantage if such a comparison were made today. (Rates of return for Social Security depend on a person\u2019s individual economic history, so there is no simple apples-to-apples comparison to make. That\u2019s why comprehensive, model-based analyses like the GAO\u2019s and the SSA's are necessary.)Now we\u2019ll add some caveats.Retirement plans can only be judged on long-term returns, so today\u2019s low rates may be putting the Galveston plan in an unusually poor light on the specific issue Cain highlighted. There\u2019s nothing to say that the Galveston rates won\u2019t rise in the future.In addition, there are some advantages to the Galveston plan -- not just to the higher earners who get more out of the program, but also to the government entity running them. The Alternate Plan doesn\u2019t face the same kind of long-term fiscal challenges that Social Security does, because it only promises participants the investment returns for the money they pay in to the system.The downside, of course, is that the investments may not perform well enough to exceed what Social Security would have provided. In addition, some commentators have said that structural reasons would prevent a Galveston-type plan from being a good model on a national level, even if it were deemed to work well in a local context.But that debate is beyond the scope of this article. On the specific question Cain raised -- whether participants in Galveston will \"retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security\" -- the answer is, \"it depends.\" According to studies published a dozen years ago, some will, and some won\u2019t. And the outlook today for the Galveston plan\u2019s rate of return -- while not immutable going forward -- is more downbeat than it was in 1999. On balance, we rate Cain\u2019s statement Half True.",

        "claim": "Photo shows solar arrays destroyed by heavy rains in July 2023",
        "doc": "\"Landslide during rainy season broke Chinese-made solar panels installed as part of green policy,\" reads a Korean-language Facebook post shared on July 15. \"If you have eyes, Moon Jae-in, look at this,\" it adds, referring to South Korea's ex-president who pledged to push for carbon neutrality by ramping up the country's supply of renewable energy. Seoul reportedly quadrupled the supply of solar power under Moon's term, but this expansion was met with accusations that solar farms increase the risk of landslides. \"The country picked the wrong president, and now there are landslides across the nation,\" reads another Facebook post which shared a similar photo of damaged solar panels on July 16. The photos were shared in a false context after at least 40 people were killed in torrential rain that hit South Korea in July, sparking flooding and landslides. While flooding is common in South Korea's summer monsoon period, scientists say climate change has made such weather events more extreme and more frequent (archived link). Similar Facebook posts falsely linking the solar panels to the monsoon were shared here, here and here. The first photo was published by South Korean news organisation News1 on August 11, 2020 in a report about solar farms damaged by landslides (archived link). \"A solar power facility lies damaged by a landslide caused by heavy rains in Jechon city's Daerang-dong in North Chungcheong province, on the afternoon of the 11th,\" the photo caption says. Below is a screenshot comparison between the photo shared on Facebook (left) and as it appears in the News1 report (right): News1 published various photos of the damaged solar farm in Jechon here, here and here (archived links here, here and here). Meanwhile, the second photo was published in a Yonhap News report on August 11, 2020 (archived link). The photo caption says: \"Solar facility damaged by a landslide in Daerang-dong in North Chungcheong province's Jechon city on the afternoon of the 8th.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the second photo on Facebook (left) and the one from the Yonhap report (right): Google Maps imagery confirms the photos were taken at the site of the solar facility at the village of Daerang-dong in Jechon. South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a press release on July 19 that it received 38 reports of damage at solar energy facilities across the country following heavy rains but that none of the cases involved landslides (archived link). Most cases of damage involved solar facilities submerged in floodwater, while others involved grid connection failures or components that were washed away, the ministry said. During Moon's term, rules about where solar arrays could be installed were strengthened in 2018 as a result of public concern about the safety of panels installed on steep mountainsides (archived link). Experts remain divided about the relationship between solar arrays and landslides. Some experts like Kyungnam University's geotechnical engineering Professor Ha Ik-soo, previously told AFP there was a lack of data to support the claim landslides mostly occur in areas with solar power facilities (archived link). Others, like former civil engineering professor Lee Soo-gon, said the displacement of vegetation in mountainous areas where solar arrays are installed made water runoffs more likely, contributing to a greater risk of landslides (archived link). AFP previously debunked a similar post that shared a photo of a damaged solar farm out of context, which also placed the blame on Moon's solar policy.",

In those years, according to the city\u2019s online database summarizing City Council election results, five second-place finishers in general elections won their runoffs: Beverly Griffith (1996); Bill Spelman and Willie Lewis (1997); Raul Alvarez (2000); and Jennifer Kim (2005).However, only two closed a first-round gap of more than 4,000 votes. Spelman bested Manuel Zuniga after trailing by 8,813 votes in their initial race. Kim overtook Margot Clarke after Clarke ran 7,771 votes ahead in the general election. The other runoff victors earlier ran behind by about 1,100 to nearly 2,100 votes.Austin consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter, agreed that just the two candidates rebounded after lagging by more than 4,000 votes. He said Spelman is the sole council hopeful in the period who bounced back from a greater percentage deficit than the nearly 13.5 points separating Shade and Tovo in this year\u2019s general election, though Kim was behind about 13 points in her first round. Shade spokeswoman Lynda Rife told us: \"The meaty part (of Shade\u2019s statement) is there\u2019s precedent for coming back.\" Littlefield also noted that three of the comeback candidates drew a greater number of votes in the second round than they got facing crowded fields in their general elections--though turnout was diminished. Kim\u2019s vote haul increased 21 percent, Spelman\u2019s runoff total bumped up 41 percent and Griffith enjoyed a 71 percent improvement.Anything could happen in the Tovo-Shade runoff; we\u2019re not making predictions.Per recent history, though, Shade\u2019s claim is off. Two comparable comebacks do not amount to \"several.\" And by percentage of votes cast, only one candidate in the last 15 years made up a deficit as large as Shade\u2019s.We rate her statement Half True.",

        "claim": "Says that \"despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family (housing) units have been created\" in the last 12 years through Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.",
        "doc": "In her campaign to become Chicago\u2019s next mayor, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle stresses her experience pushing for more affordable housing when she served on the City Council years ago. At a recent debate with her rival, Lori Lightfoot, before the Chicago Tribune\u2019s editorial board, both candidates were asked about the growing pressures of gentrification and the shrinking supply of affordable housing in Chicago. In explaining how she would attack the problem, Preckwinkle criticized a city-run program aimed in part at increasing the supply of affordable housing in better-off neighborhoods that have high rents. The program requires developers of new residential projects to either set aside a share of units at below-market rates or pay into a special fund to support less pricey housing elsewhere. \"The Affordable Requirements Ordinance \u2014 ARO \u2014 is really challenged because, my understanding is, in the last 12 years, despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created. Four hundred in 12 years,\" Preckwinkle said. \"Clearly, 400 family units in 12 years does not constitute success.\" The ARO has faced no shortage of criticism from affordable housing advocates who question whether it\u2019s too full of loopholes to be effective. That said, the 400-unit figure tossed out by Preckwinkle sounded exceedingly low. So we decided to check her math. The ARO has gone through several iterations over the years, but today it applies to developers of residential buildings with 10 or more units who want to build downtown or ask the city for zoning changes, land or financial support. Those developers must offer 10 percent of their project's total number of units at below-market rates or, in the alternative, offer fewer than 10 percent but then pay a per-unit fee to compensate for the shortfall. Daniel Hertz, a housing expert with the Chicago-based Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, said policies like the ARO can help address racial and economic segregation, but face inherent limitations in producing a large volume of affordable units. \"It\u2019s a policy that has the particular advantage of putting affordable units potentially in higher income neighborhoods,\" Hertz said. \"But it\u2019s not ever going to deliver on the scale of the (housing shortage) problem in Chicago or elsewhere.\" That said, Preckwinkle\u2019s claim significantly lowballs the modest number of units in new projects that the ARO has required developers to offer at lower rates. The city\u2019s Department of Planning and Development reports that from 2008 through September 2018, developers agreed to include nearly 800 affordable units in projects that have been built or are still underway. When we asked the Preckwinkle campaign for the source of her number, a spokesman sent us a letter to the editor in the Chicago Sun-Times from the director of a local housing group who cited an online list of affordable housing developments the city offers as a tool for prospective renters. But Justin Root, the department\u2019s project coordinator for inclusionary housing, told us that list is incomplete. \"It gives you a good idea of what\u2019s available but it\u2019s not necessarily in real time and it\u2019s not necessarily the entire amount of projects that have come online and have had or continue to have units available,\" he said. Preckwinkle\u2019s critique of the ARO\u2019s performance misses the mark in another way as well. Department records show its affordable housing fund has received more than $158 million since the program\u2019s inception in 2003, with much of it coming since 2007. Preckwinkle complained that large sum had created just a handful of units. What she didn\u2019t explain is that those funds are dispersed to promote affordable housing in a variety of ways beyond what is spent by private developers themselves to offer a share of the units they build at affordable rates. For instance, ARO funds just last year were used to underwrite rental subsidies at more than 1,400 units for residents making less than 30 percent of the area median income, department records show. Experts said that while those funds aren\u2019t being spent in ways that diversify housing in pricier parts of town, the other programs they do support are critical to helping the city\u2019s low-income residents access affordable housing. \"This program is not the main way that the city creates affordable housing,\" said Rachel Johnston of the Chicago Rehab Network. Preckwinkle said that \"despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created\" in the last 12 years through Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance. City records show that developers have either promised or produced nearly 800 units under the ARO to date. That doesn\u2019t go very far toward achieving the program\u2019s aim to create more affordable housing in pricier areas of the city or closing the city\u2019s affordable housing gap, so there\u2019s some truth to Preckwinkle\u2019s broader argument. But her figure of 400 units is far from credible. And her claim also ignores how the millions of dollars in fees collected from developers who opt out of building affordable units under the ordinance support rent subsidies and other affordable housing programs throughout the city. We rate it Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE\u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

        "claim": "\"Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country,\" adding \"more than 1,000 people a day.\"",
        "doc": "In a full-page advertisement in the Austin American-Statesman, Texans for Reliable Power suggested a need for more electricity generation in the state by presenting \"facts\" starting with: \"Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country. As we add more than 1,000 people a day, each new Texan and new business increases demand on our grid.\" Is Texas (still) growing that fast? In 2010, we rated as Mostly True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that more than 1,000 people move to Texas every day. With help from the U.S. Census Bureau, we learned that about 635 people were then coming to Texas every day, on average. A census official based that number on average daily net migration from other states (393) plus average daily net migration from other countries (242). IRS data, meanwhile, suggested that about 1,353 a day switched their residence to Texas between the time they filed their tax returns in 2007 and when they filed in 2008. Eric Bearse, a spokesman for the group, which he described as organized by investor-owned power plants, said the ad's reference to Texas having the nation\u2019s fastest population growth reflected raw changes in population, not percentage changes. That\u2019s \"because it is the raw number of people that add demand to the (electrical) grid,\" Bearse said by email before pointing out web links to census population estimates for the states through June 2013 plus a Dec. 21, 2011, census press release indicating Texas was the nation\u2019s fastest-growing state from April 2010 to July 2011. Before Bearse provided the group's back-up information, we had inquired about how fast Texas is growing to the Census Bureau and the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter. Potter drew on the bureau\u2019s state population estimates as of the end of June 2012 and June 2013 to respond by email that Texas gained more than 1,000 residents a day, by those figures, and also gained the most residents of any state. However, Potter and bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, also replying by email, each told us that Texas has not had the fastest growth rate. Specifically, Texas led the nation by gaining 387,397 residents from July 2012 through June 2013. California, ranking second, saw a population bump of 332,643, according to the bureau estimates. Yet North Dakota, whose population increased by 22,000 residents, experienced the greatest percentage growth, 3.1 percent, trailed by Utah (about a 46,000 person increase, 1.6 percent). Next among the states, Colorado and Texas each saw increases of 1.5 percent, according to the estimates. Potter and Bernstein each said that the estimated increase in the population of Texas in 2012-13 means the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over the 12 months. Our ruling The group said: \"Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country,\" adding \"more than 1,000 people a day.\" From July 2012 through June 2013, the state\u2019s population increased more than 1,000 people a day, according to government estimates. In raw numbers, Texas also added more new residents than any other state. But the state\u2019s 1.5 percent growth rate trailed the gains of North Dakota and Utah, tying the pace of growth of Colorado. North Dakota also grew faster than Texas from 2010 through June 2013, according to census bureau estimates. Texas ranks among the fastest-growing states; it\u2019s not quite No. 1.

        "doc": "When a team of Russian researchers \u201cresurrected\u201d 42,000-year-old worms previously buried nearly 100 feet in the Arctic permafrost in 2018, the internet went wild with claims that the nematodes themselves had been brought back to life, moved, and even ate. The research resurfaced again in 2020 in a Reddit post that was shared to Twitter, again claiming that \u201cafter thawing, two worms began to move and eat.\u201d Russian scientists defrosted several prehistoric worms, and two woke up. After thawing, the two worms began to move and eat. One is 32,000 years old and the other 41,700 years old. pic.twitter.com/wwLgMVkjII \u2014 Strange Facts (@StrangeFactoid) October 23, 2020 And a dive through the research revealed that this claim is true. When the study was initially published on July 16, 2018, many news outletsreported that the specimens collected from the Russian permafrost had been resurrected after having been grown in petri dishes and fed bacteria. \u201cSpoon-fed E. coli until they reproduced, you might say,\u201d said study co-author Tullis Onstott, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University who participated in the 2018 research. Along the Kolyma River in central Russia lies tens of thousands of years worth of permafrost, a thick subsurface layer of soil that is consistently frozen \u2014 and the deeper one digs, the older that soil is. Scientists in Russia dug nearly 100 feet below the ground layer and collected a buried ground squirrel burrow in 2002 that contained two specimens of roundworms, or nematodes. Samples taken from this site were carefully stored and transferred to a laboratory where they were stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Contained within this now-above-ground sample were two nematodes that had been preserved through a process known as cryptobiosis. When water surrounding an organism freezes, those that exhibit cryptobiosis can reduce their metabolic rate and energy expenditure to a point where activity is unmeasurable, or to a reversible \u201cstandstill.\u201dCryptobiosis is an environmental adaptation for organisms like tardigrades, brine shrimp, yeast and a majority of plant seeds to withstand very low temperatures and survive extreme conditions. Morphological and DNA analyses determined that the two nematodes found were females, one of the species Panagrolaimus detritophagus, and the other Plectus parvus \u2014 both of which are still around today. Radiocarbon dating determined that the permafrost sample dated back to about 40,000 years ago during an era known as the Pleistocene. And yes, it\u2019s true that these two worms were \u201cbrought back to life.\u201d This was done by placing the permafrost in petri dishes and cultivating it for several weeks while feeding the duo a diet of bacteria. \u201cThus, our data demonstrate the ability of multicellular organisms to survive long-term (tens of thousands of years) cryobiosis under the conditions of natural cryoconservation,\u201d wrote the study authors in the scientific journal Doklady Biological Sciences. \u201cIt is obvious that this ability suggests that the Pleistocene nematodes have some adaptive mechanisms that may be of scientific and practical importance for the related fields of science, such as cryomedicine, cryobiology, and astrobiology.\u201d At the time of its publication, the study was the first data to show that multicellular organisms can be isolated from Arctic permafrost deposits and, in essence, \u201cbrought to life.\u201d",

        "claim": "Significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.",
        "doc": "A federal prosecutor and a state lawmaker from western New York sparred recently over the scale of coronavirus deaths in their state. In a May 30 op-ed in the Buffalo News, James P. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, urged a quicker reopening of the economy, in part because he said that a failure to do so would cause psychological harm and spur deaths from drug abuse. In the op-ed, Kennedy said he has seen a \"roughly three-fold increase in the number of drug overdose deaths\" during the pandemic. As the country is struggling economically, he wrote, \"such measures come at a cost that goes well beyond the adverse impact they have had on our economy.\" This argument drew a response from Monica P. Wallace, a Democratic assemblywoman for the 143rd District of New York. She told the Buffalo News that Kennedy glossed over the reality that significantly more people died due to the coronavirus in two months than died of overdoses all of last year. The Buffalo News paraphrased Wallace\u2019s remark this way: \"Wallace said Kennedy failed to mention that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before.\" When we reached her, Wallace confirmed that the paraphrase was accurate. We found that her assertion is correct. For the number of coronavirus deaths, Wallace referred us to a count by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found from the beginning of April until the end of May, approximately 96,647 people died in the United States. The total number of deaths through mid-June was 103,339, according to the CDC. However, this may be an underestimate due to difficulties in collecting the full data. For the number of overdoses, Wallace referred us to CDC data. The CDC\u2019s most recent full-year data is for 2018. That year, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths. In 2017, there were 70,237 overdose deaths. So the national figures show that the two-month toll of coronavirus deaths exceeded the year-long number of drug overdose deaths in both 2017 and 2018. The same was true for New York state. There were 21,964 coronavirus deaths in New York state between the start of April and the end of May, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That compares to 3,697 drug overdose deaths for all of 2018 in New York state and 3,921 in 2017. Wallace said that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before. She\u2019s correct. Nationally, more than 96,000 Americans died of the coronavirus in April and May 2020, compared to a bit more than 70,000 Americans who died of drug overdoses in the higher of the two most recent years, 2017.

        "claim": "\u201cThanks to the insane tax-and-spending spree of President Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington, we are seeing six straight months of raging inflation.\u201d",
        "doc": "With a vote on raising the federal debt limit looming, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott is pressing the case that spending has to come down. In Scott\u2019s view, there\u2019s clear proof that Democratic fiscal policies have already made it harder for average families to pay their bills. \"Thanks to the insane tax-and-spending spree of President Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington, we are seeing six straight months of raging inflation,\" Scott said in a July 26 press release. Senate Republicans, led by Scott, followed that up with a press conference on inflation. Scott pointed to a chart showing rising prices for household essentials, like gasoline, milk and eggs. Prices have gone up, in some cases, sharply. Gasoline costs 45% more than a year ago. (Energy prices can jump up and down rapidly.) Used cars and trucks are also up 45%. Compared with a year ago, the consumer price index was up 5.4% in June, the fastest pace since August 2008. There\u2019s no question that high levels of government spending can fuel inflation. But the spending that has occurred since Biden took office, primarily through the American Rescue Plan, accounts for just a part of new government spending over the past 18 months. Other potential factors are also at play in raising prices: short-term supply interruptions, labor shortages, tariffs on imported goods, or simply the cyclical growth in consumer demand when the economy is recovering from a downturn. Economists looking at today\u2019s inflation caution that the precise cause is hard to pin down, and they vary on how much impact the most recent spending is having. But all of them underscore that heavy spending isn\u2019t just a Biden administration phenomenon. It started over a year ago, as the government tried to protect Americans and the economy from the ravages of COVID-19. In reviewing Washington\u2019s actions, we look at actual spending, rather than the maximum amount allowed under any measure. That\u2019s because where inflation is concerned, what matters is when the money gets into people\u2019s pockets. There have been several major coronavirus relief packages. The largest was the CARES Act, passed in March 2020 and signed by President Donald Trump. According to the Covid Money Tracker from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, that bill has put $1.97 trillion into the economy to date. The CARES Act provided such pillars of federal aid as the Paycheck Protection Program for companies and their workers, and expanded unemployment benefits for the millions of people who lost their jobs. Congress refilled the Paycheck Protection Program in April 2020, along with other aid, at a cost of about $500 billion. In December 2020, Congress passed additional relief, including $600 checks for most Americans. About $770 billion has been spent so far. The most recent bill was the American Rescue Plan Act championed by Biden and congressional Democrats and signed in March 2021. So far, spending from that has reached $1.05 trillion. The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s COVID-19 page shows that overall, as of the end of May 2021, federal agencies had spent or committed about $3.5 trillion since the pandemic began. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, using different methods, puts the latest tally at about $4.45 trillion. There are other amounts that can be folded into the totals, but it\u2019s safe to say about two-thirds of the spending took place before Biden took office. \"I wouldn't ascribe the government spending necessarily to Biden, as the increase in government spending to help curb the effects of COVID was already occurring during the Trump administration,\" said Columbia University economist Jennifer La\u2019O. Scott spoke of \"six straight months of raging inflation.\" That\u2019s an exaggeration. The consumer price index has been rising this year, but on a month-to-month basis, inflation didn\u2019t start accelerating significantly until March. (We look at month-to-month changes, rather than year-over-year, because 2020 was such an unusual year.) In January, prices went up 0.3%. February\u2019s increase was 0.4%. That\u2019s lower than in June and July the year before. But between March and June this year, the Consumer Price Index had an average monthly increase of 0.7%. The prices of some goods, such as gasoline and used cars, have gone up dramatically. Other increases are more modest, but they\u2019re still important for household budgets. Grocery prices are up 0.9%. Clothing is nearly 5% more expensive. Across the board, the cost of living rose 0.9%. Economy watchers look less at that topline number, and more at what is driving it. It turns out the used cars and trucks accounted for a third of the overall increase in the CPI. Federal Reserve Bank chairman Jerome Powell said that\u2019s unlikely to last. \"Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply,\" Powell said at a June 16 news conference. A global shortage of semiconductor chips has curtailed vehicle production and thinned new-car inventories, so more buyers have turned to used car and trucks, pushing up prices in that market. Eventually, Powell said, supply chains will get back on track and the surge will ease. That\u2019s what happened with an earlier spike in lumber prices. There is a risk of more deeply embedded inflation, but there are few signs of that so far. Economics 101 holds that when you add hundreds of billions of dollars to an economy, at least some people will go out and buy things. If supply doesn\u2019t ramp up at a commensurate pace, increased demand will lead to higher prices. Macroeconomist John Leahy at the University of Michigan thinks Washington\u2019s spending since last spring is fueling that type of cycle. \"The root cause of inflation is most likely the increase in aggregate demand for goods, and this increase in demand has been caused in part by the increase in government spending,\" Leahy said. \"Supply bottlenecks help to explain why supply has not kept pace with demand, but they are not prime mover.\" Stanford University economist Peter Klenow has no quibble with that basic idea, but he says he\u2019s skeptical that much of this tracks back to Biden. Klenow points to studies like one from the New York Federal Reserve that found that only about 30% of stimulus money was spent on goods. About 70% of the money went into savings or paid down debt. That money wouldn\u2019t spur demand or lead to higher prices. Klenow also doubts that a relief package passed in March 2021 would drive up inflation just three months later. \"Estimates of the effects of government spending in earlier years typically find a lag of a year or two between the spending and any noticeable effect on inflation,\" Klenow said. One final point on inflation and tax policy: Scott talked about Democrats\u2019 \"tax and spending spree.\" While Biden has said he would like to raise taxes on corporations and on people making over $400,000 a year, that has yet to happen. That aside, Leahy said that in the short run, taxes tend to trim demand, and reduce inflationary pressures. \"Tax hikes on consumers reduce disposable income and thereby reduce consumer spending,\" Leahy said. \"Tax hikes on business tend to reduce profits and thereby reduce investment. \" We reached out to Scott\u2019s office to ask about the role of taxes and Biden\u2019s spending and did not hear back. Scott said, \"Thanks to the insane tax-and-spending spree of President Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington, we are seeing six straight months of raging inflation.\" Inflation is up, and there\u2019s broad agreement that government spending has been a factor. However, most of the big spending coursing through the economy took place before Biden and the Democrats were in charge in Washington. In the past, there\u2019s been a lag of one to two years between higher government spending and higher inflation. The massive relief package in March has had little time to spur inflation. As for taxes, they haven\u2019t gone up. And if they had, that would tend to put the brakes on inflation. We rate this claim Mostly False.",

        "doc": "A video showing a ransacked supermarket with an alarm blaring in the background dates to at least 2020 and contrary to online claims, it does not show an April 2023 incident in Fairfield, California. \u201cFairfield, California Walmart...,\u201d reads a tweet sharing the video (here) (archive.is/YcqlK). The video was shared on Facebook as well (here), (here). Walmart Media Relations senior manager Robert Arrieta told Reuters in an email that the incident in the video did not happen at a Fairfield, CA store. \u201cIn all likelihood, this is an old video that someone is recirculating,\u201d Arrieta said. Reuters could not independently verify the source of the video, but another clip of the same scene was posted in a June 1, 2020 tweet (here). The video also shows the fruit section with bananas on the floor, and two U.S. flags on either side of a sign reading $2.97. The caption says the incident was filmed at a Walmart in Chicago. Another video showing a similar banana stand (see 0:28) and store layout is also labeled as Chicago Walmart in 2020 (here). Walmart\u2019s Arrieta did not confirm whether the clip shows a store in Chicago. The Fairfield, CA police said in an April 20, 2023 tweet that no such incident took place in Fairfield (here). Public Information Officer for the Fairfield Police department, Jennifer N. Brantley, also told Reuters in an email that \u201cthe footage does not depict the Fairfield, CA Walmart.\u201d Reuters fact check has debunked another similar 2020 clip from a Walmart in Chicago that was shared as recent footage from April 2023 (here).",

        "claim": "\"Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more.\"",
        "doc": "No matter where you\u2019re voting this November, chances are you\u2019ve heard your fair share of talking points on health care. Across the country, Democrats and Republicans have been trading blows about the Affordable Care Act and Republicans\u2019 efforts to chip away at it. The story is no different in North Carolina\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnston, Wake, Nash and Harnett counties. In a debate Monday night, Republican Rep. George Holding sounded off on the ACA, also known as Obamacare, for raising premiums. \"Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent, and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more,\" Holding said. Holding\u2019s complaint was a popular refrain for Republicans last year, so PolitiFact has already checked similar claims from President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. James Lankford. But the race between Holding and Democrat Linda Coleman, a former member of the state legislature, has morphed into one of the nation\u2019s more competitive contests, so we decided to put Holding\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. In short, Holding\u2019s claim that \"we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more\" is highly misleading because it conflates the whole insured population with the 2 to 5 percent of people who buy their coverage on the individual market. The Holding campaign declined to comment, but Republicans making similar claims last year often cited a 2017 report from the Department of Health and Human Services, which compared premiums from 2013 \u2014 a year before the ACA took full effect \u2014 to premiums in 2017. That report looked at policies purchased on the individual market and found that premiums were 105 percent higher on average in 2017 than they were four years earlier. A recent press release from the HHS\u2019s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed that premiums had more than doubled since Obamacare was put in place. \"Average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on HealthCare.gov in 2017, an increase of $2,928 or 105 percent,\" the press release said. Experts agree that premiums have gone up, but some have said the 2017 HHS report should be taken with a grain of salt. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University\u2019s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the 2013 and 2017 figures in the HHS report are not an apples-to-apples comparison. \"Their comparison is based on two totally different universes of individuals who are being covered,\" Anderson said. \"The ACA market is significantly more morbid, which means more sick, which means higher claim levels than the pre-2014 market.\" That\u2019s because before ACA regulations took full effect, people who had pre-existing conditions or other risk factors could be denied coverage or charged higher rates, Anderson explained. Additionally, the HHS report ignored subsidies provided under Obamacare, which lowered out-of-pocket expenses for many policyholders in 2017. These post-subsidy costs are more important anyway, since that\u2019s what they actually have to pay. The HHS study also listed several limitations to its findings, such as: A note that Obamacare imposed many new regulations not fully in place until 2014. \"In most states, these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans,\" the report said. A note acknowledging that \"older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool (in 2017) than in 2013.\" The report said this change was likely \"a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market.\" A note explaining that the report did not factor in premium changes in states that set up their own online exchanges, such as California. \"To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges, the national average increase may differ,\" the report said. With these limitations in mind, Anderson pointed instead to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, which he said shows how premiums have changed within the individual market as defined by the ACA. That data compared monthly premiums from 2014 and 2018 and showed that they rose from $273 to $481 during that period for a slightly smaller increase of about 76 percent. For the record, Anderson also said Holding was right that 91 percent of people are currently insured. But even still, the numbers were not the biggest problem with Holding\u2019s statement. Anderson said Holding\u2019s claim that \"we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more\" was \"extremely problematic\" because most people do not get insurance on the individual market, which typically provides coverage that is less comprehensive but more costly. \"This is, in my opinion, a very deceptive statement by Rep. Holding, as he is conflating the ACA created and regulated individual market with general experience in other, non-ACA regulated group and government market segments,\" he said. More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Approximately 19 and 17 percent are insured through Medicaid and Medicare, respectively, and a final 5 percent have military-provided coverage. That means the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual market covers only about 5 percent of the population, and the percentage that does not receive help from subsidies is even smaller. \"The ACA premium increases that (Holding) references are relevant for 2 to 5 percent of the population in the individual market,\" Anderson said. \"They are not reflective of what 86 to 88 percent of the population pays in premiums, where premiums have increased at a far slower rate.\" Citing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the State Health Access Data Assistance Center, Anderson said premiums for people covered by their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid have risen at a much slower rate. Employer-sponsored insurance premiums, for example, jumped about 14 to 17 percent between 2013 and 2017. So Holding has cherry-picked the worst example that covers the smallest number of people and implied that everyone is paying 100 percent more for their coverage. Holding said, \"Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more.\" There are fragments of truth in that, but the way he\u2019s constructed that statement makes it a significant distortion. While a 100 percent increase is what was reported in 2017 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the comparison distorts the truth that the vast majority of Americans encountered. Holding\u2019s claim that \"we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more\" was especially misleading because only 2 to 5 percent of people are affected by premium increases on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual market. Holding cherry-picked the smallest market for insurance and suggested that everyone was suffering that way. But for most people, the premium increases have not been nearly as steep as he said. In particular, it\u2019s simply not true that \"we\u2019re all paying 100 percent more.\" In fact, the vast majority of Americans get their coverage from employers, Medicare or Medicaid. We rate this statement False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.

Experts said nothing in a recent statement by the company suggests it\u2019s conducting research designed to make COVID-19 more harmful, as some social media users claim. The company said the research was being done to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine and the antiviral medication Paxlovid against new COVID variants.THE FACTS:A statement released Jan. 27by Pfizer in response to allegations it was conducting risky \u201cgain of function\u201d research triggered another round of false speculation against one of the top makers of COVID vaccines.\u201cSo Pfizer just admitted to gain of function research on the corona virus and that government agents forced them to keep it secret. Now how y\u2019all feel about that? Awake yet?\u201d wrote a Facebook user.Gain of function refers to scientific experiments that give an organism a new property or enhances an existing one. In the case of a virus such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, that could involve making it more harmful, or giving it the ability to transmit to other species.But the company said no such things in its statement, stressing that its vaccine-related experiments are undertaken only after a new variant has been identified by public health authorities.\u201cThis research provides a way for us to rapidly assess the ability of an existing vaccine to induce antibodies that neutralize a newly identified variant of concern,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe then make this data available through peer reviewed scientific journals and use it as one of the steps to determine whether a vaccine update is required.\u201dFor research related to its antiviral medication Paxlovid, Pfizer said that \u201cmost\u201d of the work is conducted using computer simulations or mutations of a non-infectious part of the virus.\u201cIt is important to note that these studies are required by U.S. and global regulators for all antiviral products and are carried out by many companies and academic institutions in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d the company said in its statement.Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University\u2019s College of Medicine in Waco, Texas, said nothing in the statement suggests Pfizer is conducting research designed to \u201cweaponize\u201d COVID-19 or \u201cincrease its pathogenicity,\u201d as some social media users claim.\u201cThey might be undertaking virologic research to test the limits of their technologies knowing that through virus evolution some of these changes may occur naturally,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cFrom my view, this is very different from gain of function research.\u201dBenjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University, agreed, though he concedes Pfizer\u2019s statement is \u201cwritten in a technical way\u201d that could have been \u201cmade clearer for non-science readers.\u201dHe said the company, based on its statement, is conducting experiments in response to changes made by the virus on its own, not from any changes researchers made to the virus.\u201cTo be gain of function, the researcher needs to deliberately make a change, knowing that change makes the virus more dangerous, and the change must be something the virus could not reasonably do on its own,\u201d Neuman wrote in an email. \u201cMiss out any part of that definition, and it\u2019s not gain of function. That\u2019s a really high bar, and the last part is the key.\u201dHe noted the company, in its statement, says it took an early version of the virus, and replaced the \u201cspike protein\u201d -- the component that allows the virus to easily infect human cells and replicate -- with the spike protein from the new variant.\u201cThat\u2019s a cleaner way of looking at the effect of the spike, because spike changes always come along with a sprinkling of other non-spike changes,\u201d Neuman explained. \u201cThey kept all of the virus the same, except for the spike, so any difference in how the vaccines worked would be down to the spike.\u201dAlbert Ko, who chairs the epidemiology department at the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut, said the online claims amounted to \u201cscare mongering\u201d andecho similar claimsaboutCOVID-19 research at Boston University last year.\u201cEngineering the virus does not always mean gain of function research,\u201d he said. \u201cVaccines are made this way, from taking pieces of one virus and placing it into another virus. It does not necessarily mean a high risk of creating a stronger, more dangerous virus.\u201dAt the same time, he said, the company should disclose more information about the work, such as its internal approvals process and safety protocols, as well as the rationale for the experiment design.A spokesperson for Pfizer declined to respond to requests for additional comment.\u201cThe statement stands as our comment on the false allegations currently being made about vaccine research at Pfizer,\u201d Amy Rose wrote in an email.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

(Image for representation: GettyImages) A picture of a girl with injuries in her mouth is going viral on social media with the claim that Brahmins in Uttar Pradesh's Bundelkhand region cut off the tongue of a Class 8 girl and offered it as a sacrifice to Lord Shiva to prevent coronavirus infections in their village. Twitter user \"Migrant Kamran\" posted the picture and wrote, \"There is limit of hypocrisy & superstition.

But neither mainstream media nor celebrities will outrage on this.\" India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. This was a case of superstition that took place in UP's Banda district. The 16-year-old girl seen in the picture had herself bit off her tongue and offered it a sacrifice to Lord Shiva to save her village from coronavirus. The archived version of the post can be seen here. The post is also viral on Facebook. AFWA investigation Using related keywords, we found some news reports regarding the incident. A report by News 18 says that influenced by superstition, a 16-year-old girl in Banda's Bhadwal village cut off her tongue and offered it as a sacrifice in a Shiva temple to save the village from coronavirus. The incident took place on May 20 and the girl is out of danger now. The girl and her family told India Today that she had cut off her tongue herself and offered it to Lord Shiva as a vow. As per the girl's father, his daughter is religious and had been worshipping in the Shiva temple every day for the last four years. We also reached out to Banda ASP Lal Bharat Kumar Pal regarding the matter. He said the girl cut off her tongue herself and the claim that Brahmins did it is false. A similar incident was also reported in April when a 24-year-old migrant in Gujarat chopped off his tongue to appease a goddess to stop the spread of coronavirus. Therefore, it can be concluded that the minor girl had chopped off her tongue herself as a sacrifice to Lord Shiva so that her village is safe from coronavirus. The act was not committed by others. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Brahmins in UP's Bundelkhand region cut off the tongue of a Class 8 girl and offered it as sacrifice to Lord Shiva to save their village from coronavirus.

        "doc": "As flu season begins, some Instagram users are posting photos with misinformation about vaccines. In one post published Oct. 22, an account called Holistic Health & More, which has more than 165,000 followers, claimed the flu shot can lead to the death of fetuses. \"4250% increase fetal death from flu shot,\" the photo reads. \"CDC failed to tell pregnant mothers of the increase (sic) chance of miscarriage & stillbirth after receiving CDC recommended flu vaccine.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram\u2019s parent company.) It has more than 1,700 likes, and PolitiFact found several copies of the post elsewhere on the internet. (Screenshot from Instagram) As evidence for its claim, Holistic Health & More linked to a website called VacTruth.com, a known publisher of anti-vaccine misinformation. The site requires a password to enter, so we were not able to locate the article in question. Holistic Health & More did not respond to a message requesting more evidence. We found one study that did observe a spike in \"spontaneous abortion,\" or miscarriage, among women who had been vaccinated for the flu \u2014 but the bulk of research has found no link between the vaccine and infant mortality. Importantly, medical officials still recommend pregnant women get the flu shot because they can be more prone to severe illness from the flu, as can their babies. We traced the Instagram post to an anti-vaccine blog entry from November 2016. The blog, Health Freedom Idaho, is part of a libertarian movement that opposes health regulations and advocates for nontraditional care. The blog post links to a 2013 study published by the journal Human & Experimental Toxicology. It looked at miscarriages and stillbirths listed in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database of reported vaccine side effects maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. RELATED: No, you\u2019re not an \u2018active, live walking virus\u2019 for 2 weeks following a flu shot The study found an increase in \"fetal loss reports\" among pregnant women who received the flu shot during two consecutive seasons, from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010. (The season typically spans from fall to spring.) Approximately 587,600 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot in 2008-09, and about 2,236,000 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot and/or the swine flu vaccine the next year. The study noted a jump in fetal loss reports from four in 2008-09 to 174 in 2009-10. That\u2019s a 4,250% increase \u2014but it doesn\u2019t mean you should interpret it the way this blogger did. The researchers did not prove that the flu shot was the cause of the uptick. The CDC lists several limitations of this data. The reason why it\u2019s unreliable has to do with the fact that health care providers are encouraged to report any health problems following the administration of vaccines \u2014 even if they don\u2019t believe the vaccine was the cause. \"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,\" the CDC\u2019s list of limitations reads. \"The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.\" Experts concurred with those limitations. \"The study you cite is trying to do something with VAERS data which is not valid,\" said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Public Health, in an email. \"The results of this study do not contribute to our scientific understanding of the issue.\" The study cited by the Instagram post isn\u2019t the only one to link the flu shot with miscarriages. But most research shows that the vaccine is safe, and the CDC recommends it for all pregnant women so they can avoid complications caused by flu infections. One study, which was published in the journal Vaccine in September 2017, compared nearly 500 pregnant women who had miscarriages during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 flu seasons to the same number of women who had normal deliveries during the same period. Researchers found that, of the women who miscarried, 17 had received the flu shot within a month of miscarrying and also received the vaccine the year prior. However, the study\u2019s authors warned that the results did not suggest a causal link between the flu vaccine and miscarriage \u2014and they still said pregnant women should receive the flu shot. On its website, the CDC also doubts the study\u2019s results. RELATED: Bloggers poison truth in claim about flu shot dangers The CDC says the bulk of research supports the notion that the flu shot is safe for pregnant women and that the risk of miscarriage is low. It cites several studies that have found no increased risk of miscarriage as a result of receiving the flu shot. \u2022 A 2013 study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology did not find an increased risk of pregnancy loss within four weeks of receiving the flu vaccine. \u2022 A 2014 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that, among 57,554 vaccinated and unvaccinated women, the flu vaccine did not lead to an increased or decreased risk of \"preterm birth.\" \u2022 A 2017 review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between 2010 and 2016 found no evidence to suggest a connection between the flu vaccine and pregnancy complications. \u2022 A 2017 study found that, even when it is administered during the first trimester of pregnancy, the flu vaccine was not associated with structural birth defects. In addition to the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that pregnant women receive the flu shot. \"In evaluating all of the available scientific information, there is insufficient information to support changing the current recommendation which is to offer and encourage routine flu vaccinations during pregnancy regardless of the trimester of pregnancy,\" Haywood Brown, former president of the professional association, wrote in September 2017. An Instagram post claimed that there is a 4,250% increase in fetal death from flu shots. That claim can be traced to a 2013 study that found an increase in fetal death among pregnant women between two consecutive flu seasons. But the CDC and experts say the way that data was collected was problematic. The bulk of research shows there is no connection between miscarriage and the flu shot, and the CDC and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend all pregnant women get the vaccine. The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

        "doc": "Update (June 8, 2020): This viral image started recirculating on social media after the death of George Floyd. It remains Pants on Fire false. A day after a black activist was kicked and punched by voters at a Donald Trump rally in Alabama, Trump tweeted an image packed with racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics. The image shows a masked, dark-skinned man with a handgun and a set of points, ostensibly about deaths in 2015: \"Blacks killed by whites -- 2%\" \"Blacks killed by police -- 1%\" \"Whites killed by police -- 3%\" \"Whites killed by whites -- 16%\" \"Whites killed by blacks -- 81%\" \"Blacks killed by blacks -- 97%\u2019 The image cites the \"Crime Statistics Bureau - San Francisco\" Here is the image: None of the numbers are supported by official sources. The figures on black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate. And, as several news organizations quickly noted, the \"Crime Statistics Bureau\" doesn\u2019t exist. We looked for that agency as well and the closest we found in San Francisco were a number of crime scene clean-up services. Interracial homicides While the image references 2015, the year is not over, and no official numbers have been released. The latest data comes from the FBI for 2014. This table contrasts Trump\u2019s figures with the official ones. Blacks killed by whites Trump Number: 2% FBI Number: 8% Error factor: 4 times Blacks killed by blacks Trump Number: 97% FBI Number: 90% Error factor: Just a little off Whites killed by whites Trump Number: 16% FBI Number: 82% Error factor: 5.4 times Whites killed by blacks Trump Number: 81% FBI Number: 15% Effor factor: 5.4 times Killings by police We also looked atwhat percentage of each race the police have killed. The official tally of deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers is well known to be incomplete. A study this year by the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that official counts miss between 30 to 40 percent of all police-related deaths. The Washington Post has worked to fill the gap by compiling a database of police shootings for 2015. The most recent figures from the Post show 414 whites killed, compared to 223 blacks, as of Nov. 23, 2015. Trump\u2019s tweet said police were responsible for 3 percent of all white homicides and 1 percent of all black homicides. If that were true, then applying those percentages to the FBI report of all homicides in 2014, 91 whites would have died at the hands of police and 25 blacks. That\u2019s a ratio of nearly 4-to-1. In contrast, the Washington Post data show slightly less than two white deaths for each black death. One of the official, and incomplete, sources for people killed at the hands of police is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention violent death database. Itshows a ratio of about 1.5 whitedeaths for each black death, in the period 2009 to 2013. Trump\u2019s number is about double the most accurate figures we could find. That makes him about 100 percent off. Parenthetically, the website Little Green Footballs traced the original image back to a Twitter stream that appears to originate in the United Kingdom and features a modified swatiska with the line \"Should have listened to the Austrian chap with the little moustache.\" Our ruling Trump tweeted an image that made various statistical claims, including that blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victims. Almost every number in the image is wrong. The statistics on white victims are exaggerated five-fold. The police-related deaths are off as well. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",

        "doc": "A videoshared on Facebookallegedly shows citizens in Moldova blocking a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) column in 2022.\n\n\n\nVerdict: Misleading\n\nWhile the video is from Moldova and shows a NATO column being blocked, the video is from 2016.\n\nFact Check:\n\nUkraine applied for NATO membership last week after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, according toThe Associated Press. Several European nations, including Poland and Slovakia, issued a statement supporting Ukraine\u2019s application, the outlet reported.\n\nThe Facebook video claims to show a recent protest where Moldovan residents blocked NATO equipment from advancing. The video\u2019s caption partially reads, \u201cPeople do not want the presence of the alliance in the country and do not allow #NATO cars to pass.\u201d\n\nThe video predates the current state of affairs in Europe. A reverse image search found that the video first appeared in 2016 onYouTubetitled, \u201cMoldova: Anti-NATO Protesters Block U.S. Tanks.\u201d(RELATED: Does This Video Show The Finnish-Russian Border After Vladimir Putin\u2019s Speech?)\n\n\n\n\u201cAnti-NATO activists blocked a United States armored convoy which was heading for military drills with the Moldovan army near the city of Negresti,\u201d the video\u2019s caption reads.\n\nProtests took place during this time as U.S. troops conducted joint exercises with the Moldovan military, according toRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Russian state mediareportedthat Moldova\u2019s then president opposed U.S. forces participating in the Victory Day parade.\n\nDemonstrations have recently appeared against Moldova\u2019s pro-western government, but news reports from media outlets such asVoice of AmericaandRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty have not noted any protesters blockading NATO equipment.\u00a0NATO has likewise not issued anystatementsabout protests in Moldova or suggested columns were being blocked in the country.\n\nThis is not the first time a video from a European country has been miscaptioned to represent the current state of affairs in the region.

Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post. Claim: Government of India will stop issuing new Aadhaar cards for persons older than 5 years from 01 October 2022. Fact: UIDAI and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) have not issued any such order to stop new Aadhaar enrolments. Further, Minister of State for MeitY clarified that the enrolment for Aadhaar is a continuous process in the country. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. We searched the internet with relevant keywords and found no such news reported by media outlets. Also, there were no notifications/circulars regarding this claim in UIDAI and MeitY websites. Moreover, in February 2022, when asked whether the process of issuing Aadhaar cards to the citizens of the country has been completed or not, the Minister for State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajiv Chandra Sekhar answered that considering the birth of children every year and left out population of other age groups, the requirement for new enrolment for Aadhaar is a continuous process. To sum it up, enrolment for Aadhaar is a continuous process. Indian Government has not taken any such decision to stop issuing new Aadhaar after 01 October 2022.",

They get food and water only when they are captured,\u201d reads part of the post, adding that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was desperately clinging to power in the Amhara region. The post includes a photo of a civilian feeding a man in military uniform lying on a blanket on the ground. Another man in uniform is lying next to him. Their uniforms are similar to those worn by Ethiopian troops. A day before the post was published, Ethiopian authorities arrested (archived here) individuals that they accused of being part of the escalating conflict in the Amhara region. Earlier, the Ethiopian Council of Ministers imposed a state of emergency in the region (archived here) to quell the violence. The paramilitary group known as Fano, which is fighting against federal forces in the region over a decision to disarm them, is in control of three major towns (archived here), according to residents. The same photo posted here also claims \u201cAmhara people are taking care of the captured defence troops in this way\u201d, in Amharic. However, the image is unrelated to the regional conflict currently taking place in Amhara. AFP Fact Check conducted reverse image searches and established that the photo was already being shared a year ago during the war between the Ethiopian army and forces from the Tigray region, which borders Amhara to the north. It was published on X, formerly Twitter, on January 7, 2022 (archived here). \u201cHappy Christmas to our dedicated heroes who are falling in the forest for the sake of our freedom, security and peace and for defending mother land Ethiopia\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d reads the post, which was written in Amharic. The account responsible for the post has more than 46,000 followers and regularly shares pro-government messages. A similar post on X was published here on the same day. The timing of the original posts coincides with the war in Tigray that ended in November 2022. They were also posted during Ethiopian Christmas, which is usually celebrated in January according to the local calendar.",

The clip shows a woman in a white wedding dress cutting a cake alongside male twins wearing red suits. \"South Africa has amended the Marriage Act to allow women to marry two husbands. This was the first wedding under the new law,\" the Facebook post reads. A Canadian-based radio station called G-Power Radio also shared the claim on its Facebook page, which has more than 50,000 followers. The same claim was shared on Facebook (here and here), Instagram (here, here and here) as well as Twitter. The claim surfaced after South Africa\u2019s Department of Home Affairs released amendment proposals to the Marriage Act in early May. They include the recognition of polyandry, which would allow women to marry more than one man at the same time. But contrary to what the misleading posts claim, the draft bill has not yet been passed into law, and a public consultation is underway until June, as local media reported here and here. A reverse image search with video analysis tool InVID WeVerify located the video on the Instagram account of Nigerian actress Moyo Lawal (see here and here). She dismissed the misleading claims that she was South African as false, also tagging the alleged twin grooms whose handle is @starguyz_twins. The pair are Nigerian celebrity twins Joseph and Emmanuel Etim. The two also posted the clip of the alleged wedding here. AFP Fact Check found that the video is part of Nigeria\u2019s \u201cEmpire VIP House on Wheels\u201d reality show in which contestants tour Lagos on a bus and live together in a house for four weeks. The housemates are gradually evicted, and the audience gets to choose the winner who walks away with the grand prize. A spokesman for Empire Entertainment, which produces the show, told AFP Fact Check that the wedding had been part of the game's challenges. \"We told the contestants to officiate a marriage. It was a prank marriage,\" Deji Yakubu told AFP Fact Check. South Africa currently recognises three types of marriages; civil marriages, customary marriages and civil unions (which recognise same-sex marriages).",

        "claim": "Under the DREAM Act, after two years of higher education or military service \"you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of (your) extended family to the United States.\"",
        "doc": "Criticizing an immigration proposal that would allow undocumented residents brought to the United States as minors to qualify for citizenship, U.S. Rep. Ted Poe of Texas says illegal immigrants are \"breaking the bank.\" In a Poe opinion piece posted Dec. 2 on Newsmax.com, the Republican from Humble questions why Congress would pass a law \"that discriminates against Americans and lawful immigrants to the benefit of those who break our laws?\" \"After you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship,\" he writes. \"Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States.\" We wondered if Poe correctly summarized the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act. Poe did not initially respond to our inquiries. To start, we read the latest version of the act, Senate Bill 3992, which was introduced Nov. 30 by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. According to the legislation, undocumented residents become eligible for its benefits if they're younger than 30, have been brought to the United States at age 15 or younger and have lived here for at least five years prior to the measure becoming law. Also, such a resident must spend 10 years in the United States as a \"conditional non-immigrant,\" during which he or she must complete two years of higher education or serve in the military. One year before the 10-year period is up, \"conditional non-immigrants\" may apply to become a permanent resident. Even then, it's not bad-a-bing, citizenship. Applicants must be of \"good moral character,\" have not committed a felony, haven't persecuted someone based on their race, religion or nationality, engaged in voter or marriage fraud and submit to a background check and physical exam, among other hurdles. After three more years, the permanent resident is eligible to become a naturalized citizen. Barbara Hines, a law professor who specializes in immigration at the University of Texas at Austin, told us: \"It is a 13 year process to citizenship, far longer than for any other immigrant group... there is way too much disinformation out there.\" Next, we wondered: Could these new citizens then bring their \"extended\" family to the United States, as Poe says? That depends on how you define extended family. By some definitions, it extends beyond the nuclear family (parents and their children) to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts and uncles, as well as spouses who are not blood kin. The U.S. State Department says on its website that U.S. citizens can sponsor immediate family members \u2014 a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 \u2014 to enter the country with an \"immediate relative immigrant visa.\" Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents as well. A citizen can also enable older children, their spouses and children, and siblings, their spouses and minor children to relocate here, though a limited number of \"family preference immigrant visas\" are available for such relatives, according to the website. When the number of applicants for that visa exceeds the number available, applicants get bumped to a waiting list. Citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to get visas. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally pro-immigration, said: \"The lines for sponsoring extended relatives, particularly from countries such as Mexico and the Philippines, can be very long, with waits of years and sometimes more than two decades.\" Hines echoed that sentiment. \"For a sibling, for example, from Mexico, that wait is at least 12 years or more because the visas for that category move very slowly.\" As we were wrapping up this article, we made a final run at getting Poe's perspective. DeeAnn Thigpen, a Poe spokeswoman, told us that Poe was summarizing \"several versions of the bill\" \u2014 there are various versions floating around Congress. When we relayed our research to her, specifically about the number of family members that U.S. citizens cannot sponsor to come here, she said: \"That's still a large amount of family that you're able to bring.\" Upshot: Two years in a higher-ed institution or the military is key to achieving citizenship under the DREAM Act, as Poe says. But he skips over many other stipulations that an undocumented resident must satisfy before becoming a citizen. The proposed process would not be rapid, nor would the outcome be assured. After achieving citizenship, a formerly undocumented resident could sponsor some family members to move here\u2014parents, children, grandchildren, spouses, siblings, nieces and nephews (if they're minors). But that doesn't mean they could bring in all the rest of their extended family, contrary to the statement. Left out: Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws. We rate Poe's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour \u201cwould destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.\u201d",
        "doc": "Would raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour \"destroy up to 3.7 million jobs\" in the United States? That\u2019s what GOP House Minority Leader and California Rep. Kevin McCarthy claimed in the headline of a press release on Tuesday as Democrats in Congress began debating the move. On Twitter the same day, McCarthy wrote the wage hike \"could put nearly 4 million Americans out of work.\" This is a screen shot of the headline from McCarthy\u2019s press release. The Biden Administration last month proposed raising the federal minimum hourly pay from $7.25 to $15, with increases of about $1.50 every year for five years. To make that happen, Congressional Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 last month and began considering the legislation in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week. Here\u2019s what McCarthy said in the body of the press release: \"At this critical point, the Democrats\u2019 big, creative response is to raise the federal national wage to $15 an hour \u2014 a move the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office previously found could cost nearly 4 million workers their jobs.\" President Joe Biden initially included the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. But he predicted last week it would be left out due to opposition from Republicans and centrist Democrats. Given the debate over raising the wage and its impact on jobs, we decided to take a closer look at McCarthy\u2019s claim in this fact check. Our Research In his press release and tweet, McCarthy linked to an analysis of the wage proposal by the Congressional Budget Office published on Monday. The CBO, a nonpartisan research service, predicted the wage hike would eliminate jobs, but would also raise wages for an estimated 17 million people and lift 900,000 people out of poverty. It doesn\u2019t say anything about destroying an estimated \"3.7 million\" positions as McCarthy claimed. Instead, the CBO said \"the average estimate is that employment would be reduced by 1.4 million workers.\" The report goes on to say there\u2019s a \"one-third chance\" the loss will be between 1 million and 2.7 million workers, still far less than McCarthy\u2019s number. \"Young, less educated people would account for a disproportionate share of those reductions in employment,\" the report adds. A spokesperson for McCarthy did not respond to questions. Deborah Kilroe, a spokesperson for the CBO, said McCarthy likely got his figure from a July 2019 CBO report that also examined raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. That older analysis predicted the \"median estimate\" for job losses would be 1.3 million. Meanwhile, it said \"there is a two thirds chance that the change in employment would be between about zero and a decrease of 3.7 million workers.\" That last figure lines up with McCarthy\u2019s statement of \"nearly 4 million workers,\" but it comes from the high-end of an old report and ignores what the CBO published this week. Last month, FactCheck.org found Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul also distorted the facts on this topic. The senator told Fox News that \"the government estimates are close to 4 million people will lose their jobs,\" if the minimum wage hike goes through. FactCheck.org examined the July 2019 CBO report [the current report had yet to be published] and found Paul cherry-picked the high-end of that report. Our Ruling Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour \"would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs.\" McCarthy appears to be citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis from 2019 that said, at the high-end, 3.7 million jobs could be lost from the wage hike. But in his statement, he linked to the CBO\u2019s new analysis published this week which found an average estimate of 1.4 million jobs would be lost, a figure he omitted. The new CBO report added there\u2019s a \"one-third chance\" the loss will be between 1 million and 2.7 million workers, still far less than McCarthy\u2019s claim. In the end, we found McCarthy cherry-picked a figure from an old report while ignoring current data on the topic that tells a different story. We rated his claim False. FALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.",

Bhandari is a judge on the Court, which has no 'chief justice', but rather a president and a vice-president. The claim further suggests, albeit falsely, that by becoming its 'chief justice', Bhandari has broken a British stranglehold on a position held by them for the past 71 years. Data available with the ICJ that the presidents of the Court have come from a variety of countries, including India. However, of the 26 presidents that have served on the Court, 4 have hailed from the United Kingdom, the most from any one country. Other than Bhandari, three Indians have served on the ICJ, with one Indian -- Nagendra Singh -- also serving as its president from 1985 to 1988, when he died in office on December 11 that year.

The ICJ is one of the six principle organs of the United Nations, authorised to settle legal disputes between states and act in an advisory capacity to the UN and its other organs. It consists of 15 judges, each elected for nine-year terms. The election of the judges takes place simultaneously but independently in the United Nations General Assembly -- the UN's policymaking organ -- and the Security Council -- the UN's most powerful organ able authorise military and economic actions to maintain world peace. 2. Is Bhandari a 'chief justice' on the ICJ? No. Bhandari is one of the 15 judges on the ICJ, but he is not the 'chief justice', as a such a position does not exist. The head of the Court is the President of the Court (and a Vice-President of the Court), elected for three-year terms, according to Article 21 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (available here). Bhandari has been a judge on the ICJ since 2012, but was re-elected from a fresh 9-year term in 2017 (assuming his new term from 2018 through 2027). He has been a judge on India's Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court, and a judge with the Delhi High Court. His profile with the ICJ can be found here. Three other Indians have been judges on the ICJ - Sir Benegal Rau from 1952 - 1953, Negendra Singh from 1973 to 1988 and Raghunandan Swarup Pathak from 1989 to 1991. 3. Have only British held the position as head of the ICJ? No. Judges from several nationalities have held the position as president of the Court, including Nagendra Singh from India from 1985 - 1988. The maximum number of presidents through have been British (four of 26 presidents), followed by the US and France (three each). Find the list below. 4. Did Bhandari win 183 of 193 votes in his election? Yes. Bhandari was elected to the ICJ with 183 votes of 193 member nations in the United Nations General Assembly when he was re-elected to a new nine-year term on November 20, 2017. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs supported Bhandari's candidature, and resorted to diplomacy to get Bhandari elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council. \"The UN Security Council and the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in support of India. Judge Dalveer Bhandari received all 15 votes in the UN Security Council and 183 out of the 193 votes in the UN General Assembly\", said the Ministry. All information regarding Bhandari's election in 2017 can be found with the Ministry of External Affairs here. Also Read: BV Nagarathana Set To Be India's First Woman Chief Justice In 2027 ",

We will save you the trouble of hand-cranking your own ice cream and let you know right now: We couldn\u2019t find any evidence that this was true. And it just so happens your friendly PolitiFact writer has made homemade vanilla ice cream without preservatives. The recipe, a lot like this one, called for milk, cream, sugar, egg yolks and vanilla. The vanilla extract was brown. But because the amount of vanilla the recipe called for was a fraction of its total volume, the end product was merely off-white\u2014a lot like the vanilla ice cream at the grocery store. Historical photos show ice cream of a similar color. Though it\u2019s unclear what kind of ice cream the \"society women\" in this photo from 1900 are eating, the scoops are light. So what about that black ice cream? It was a trend a few years ago when some shops used activated charcoal to create it\u2019s dark hue. Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream in New York sold a coconut ash ice cream cone. A 2017 Eater story says: \"The idea of charcoal as a detoxifier isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, but consumers are now more interested in charcoal-tinted ice cream and pizza because it makes for excellent Instagram fodder. The black ice cream from shops like Morgenstern\u2019s in New York City and Los Angeles\u2019 Little Damage have been posted to social media thousands of times, along with inspiring countless copycats at ice cream shops across the country.

Snopes, for example, fact-checked it back in 2017. \"We contacted a representative for Morgenstern\u2019s in 2017, who told us that the image indeed shows its \u2018coconut ash\u2019 flavor and confirmed that they also sold black cones,\" the story says.

There is no evidence that any of these leaders\u2019 deaths were connected to their position on COVID-19 vaccines. Mo\u00efse was the only one assassinated, and experts say his death will likely further hinder the vaccine effort in Haiti, not help it. Meanwhile, Ratsiraka, former president of Madagascar who died in March, hadn\u2019t been in power since 2002. Both he and Magufuli died with heart-related issues, according to news reports. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The death of Tanzania\u2019s 61-year-old president, John Magufuli, was announced on March 17, 2021, by Samia Suluhu Hassan, who was the vice president at the time and is now president. Today as we lay to rest our beloved President Dr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli; on behalf of the People of the United Republic of Tanzania and on my own behalf i would like to thank fellow Compatriots; National Leaders, Religious Leaders, Political Leaders, Diplomatic Community, pic.twitter.com/ZQjiZCd03W In a public address, Hassan said Magufuli died of a heart condition at a hospital in Dar es Salaam. He had not been seen in public for more than two weeks before his death. There is no evidence that he was murdered. Magufuli, one of Africa\u2019s most prominent COVID-19 skeptics, mocked the effectiveness of masks, banned COVID-19 testing, prohibited doctors from diagnosing, and announced in June 2020 that the country had defeated the pandemic through prayer. Doctors were barred from wearing face masks, and some said they were forced to classify infections or deaths they believed to be from COVID-19 as pneumonia, heart disease or other illnesses. Magufuli\u2019s government refused to purchase any vaccines. He instead claimed the shots could be harmful and told Tanzanians, without evidence, that using steam inhalation and herbal medicines would fight off the disease. Hassan, meanwhile, has slowly taken a more serious approach to the pandemic. She\u2019s worn masks in public, opened COVID-19 testing centers and announced in June 2021 that the country had ordered its first batch of vaccines. Ratsiraka was Madagascar's former head of state, and not its current president when he died at the age of 84 on March 28, 2021. His cause of death wasn\u2019t immediately disclosed, but local media reported that his family said he died of cardiac arrest. Ratsiraka served as president of the island from 1975 to 1993, and again from 1997 to 2002. The announcement of his death was made on Twitter by the current president of Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina. \"The Malagasy have lost an illustrious patriot,\" Rajoelina wrote. \"I extend my condolences to his relatives, to the great family of the army and to all Malagasy citizens.\" Along with his wife, Ratsiraka was admitted to the hospital days earlier for the flu, according to local reports, and had tested negative for COVID-19, his relatives said. The country initially rejected the vaccines, touting an herbal remedy instead, before it signed up for the World Health Organization\u2019s COVAX initiative in April. In May, it received its first batch of 250,000 doses of Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. There is no evidence that Ratsiraka was killed, and he was not serving as Madagascar\u2019s president when he died. Haitian President Mo\u00efse is the only one in this group who was assassinated. It happened when a group of gunmen entered his home July 7 and opened fire, killing him and injuring his wife. More than 20 people have been arrested in connection with the killing, most recently including Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a 63-year-old Haitian man living in South Florida. Sanon describes himself as a doctor despite records showing no medical license in the state, according to the Miami Herald. Others involved told Haitian officials that their mission wasn\u2019t to kill Mo\u00efse, the Herald reported, but instead to serve a 2019 arrest warrant before installing Sanon as the new president. The lack of COVID-19 vaccines in the country appears to be due to both the government\u2019s hesitation to acquire doses, as well as administrative ineptitude. A shipment of 130,000 doses, scheduled to arrive in mid-June, was delayed for unknown reasons and pushed to an undetermined date. Mo\u00efse\u2019s killing appears unrelated to Haiti\u2019s lack of vaccines. It followed months of rising political turmoil and gang violence in the country. Protests against Mo\u00efse grew in his last year of office when he declined to step down amid a dispute over when his term should end. He ruled by decree as the terms of elected officials across the country expired and no elections were held. Meanwhile, public health experts told the Washington Post that the assassination will hurt the troubled vaccine rollout, not help it. A Facebook post claims that the presidents of Haiti, Tanzania and Madagascar were all killed after their countries refused the COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that any of the men were killed because of their countries reluctance over the COVID-19 vaccines. Magufuli and Ratsiraka both reportedly died in hospitals of heart-related issues, and the latter had been out of power for nearly 20 years. Mo\u00efse was the only one assassinated among the group, following months of political turmoil in the country over his governing and rising crime. We rate this False.",

Several days later, that decision was spoofed in a humor piece (translated from the original Spanish) positing that Samsung had paid off the award in nickels: Samsung Pays Apple $1 Billion Sending 30 Trucks Full of 5 Cents Coins This morning more than 30 trucks filled with 5-cent coins arrived at Apple\u2019s headquarters in California. Initially, the security company that protects the facility said the trucks were in the wrong place, but minutes later, Tim Cook (Apple CEO) received a call from Samsung CEO explaining that they will pay $1 billion dollars for the fine recently ruled against the South Korean company in this way. The funny part is that the signed document does not specify a single payment method, so Samsung is entitled to send the creators of the iPhone their billion dollars in the way they deem best. Many readers who came across the article as it was circulated online mistook it for real news, even though the original and its most common reproductions were labeled as \u201chumor\u201d and \u201csatire.\u201d But even for those who encountered it out of context, several aspects of the story should have stood out as implausible: Q. Was the verdict final? A. No. Samsung is challenging it. First, Samsung will first ask the trial judge to toss the verdict. Then it will appeal to a court in Washington that specializes in patent appeals. Samsung has vowed to take the fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. (Indeed, a judge later found the jury had miscalculated $400 million in damages for 13 products and ordered a new trial to determine how much Samsung should pay.) As to the hypothetical question of whether Apple would be obligated to accept payment of damages in such a form, since the late 19th century pennies and nickels have been considered legal tender and are therefore \u201ca valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor.\u201d (Businesses selling goods or services are not required by law to accept legal tender as payment, but this particular scenario involves payment of a debt rather than a purchase of goods or services.)",

        "doc": "There\u2019s no evidence that Hillary Clinton once said she\u2019d like to see \"people like Donald Trump run for office.\" The widely debunked claim features a picture of Clinton standing next to Trump. Below the image is text that says, \"Hillary Clinton in 2013: \u2018I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They\u2019re honest and can\u2019t be bought.\u2019 \" Clinton did not say that. That\u2019s a fabricated quote that\u2019s circulated for years on Facebook and websites associated with satire and misinformation. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture associated with the claim is from Donald and Melania Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding reception, which Clinton attended. The quote is a spinoff from a speech Clinton reportedly gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013. A transcript of the alleged speech was published by WikiLeaks, as it released emails stolen from John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign manager. NPR reported in 2016 that the Clinton campaign refused to verify the documents\u2019 authenticity. Clinton, according to the Wikileaks transcript for that 2013 Goldman Sachs speech, was asked whether a \"wholesale change\" was needed in Washington in terms of people running for office. Clinton\u2019s response: \"That's a really interesting question. You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office. I really would like to see that because I do think, you know, you don't have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom. And there's that memorable phrase from a former member of the Senate: You can be maybe rented but never bought.\" The transcript doesn\u2019t say that Clinton specifically mentioned Trump by name. As Snopes and Factcheck.org noted, the quote attributed to Clinton stemmed from websites claiming to be a \"hybrid\" of news and satire. Clinton did not say, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They\u2019re honest and can\u2019t be bought.\" We rate that made-up quote as False.",

The 12-second video shows a bus filled with water driving through a flooded street. During the video, an announcement in Mandarin can be heard.

        "claim": "Currently, almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected with HIV.",
        "doc": "The health departments in Fulton and Dekalb counties are hosting a week of free HIV screenings that ends on National HIV Testing Day, June 27. The immediate goal of the Test Atlanta campaign, which starts Sunday, is to encourage people from age 13 to 64 to know their HIV status by getting tested, officials with Fulton County Health and Wellness said in a press release on June 16, 2015. \"Finding out whether you are infected with HIV is the first step to getting connected to life-saving care,\" the release states. \" It\u2019s estimated almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they have developed AIDS. That can be up to 10 years after they first became infected.\" Those statistics got our attention. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check further. We contacted Lyn Vaughn, risk communicator with Fulton County Health and Wellness, to ask the source of those statistics. She provided with us links to, and excerpts from, two statements, one from the Centers for Disease Control and one she said was from the National Association of People Living with AIDS, the group credited with starting the national testing day. The report from the CDC, issued in 2010, said nationally, the proportion of patients diagnosed with AIDS at or within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis in 2007 was 32 percent. We tried to contact officials with the association to ask about the source of their statistics but were unsuccessful. We later learned from the group\u2019s web site that the association filed bankruptcy and closed its doors after 30 years in February 2013. The CDC, which supported National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) from its founding, continues to promote the annual event and advocate for routine HIV testing. According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and almost one in seven or 14 percent are unaware of their infection. In the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, but the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable -- at about 50,000 a year, the CDC reports. So what about that statistic? Vaughn later sent us additional information, including a recent news report on ongoing HIV testing available to patients who come through the emergency room at Atlanta\u2019s Grady Memorial Hospital. Not all of the patients agree to be tested. But among those who were diagnosed as HIV infected between July 2013 and February of this year, nearly half had AIDS, according to data we received from Grady. The physician in charge of Grady\u2019s program said many of the patients in the group that was subject of the report had been HIV positive for several years. The other data we looked at came from the state Department of Public Health. In Georgia, 24 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV patients in 2012 already had AIDS, the agency reported. That percentage also held true for 2013 as well, DPH reports show. We also circled back to the CDC, where the most recent data available is for 2012. Nationally, also, 24 percent of patients who were initially diagnosed with HIV infection were simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS, the CDC reported in 2012. Most of those people were likely infected for many years without knowing it, the CDC said. Our ruling The press release from Fulton County Health and Wellness promoting the week of testing for HIV states that almost 40 percent of people with the virus are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected. That specific statistic reportedly came from a national organization that is no longer in operation and appears high compared to the 24 percent figure reported t by the state and CDC. But that still supports the health department\u2019s overarching point about the need for early testing and treatment. For that reason, we rate the statement Mostly True. ",

        "claim": "\"In America today, women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work.\"",
        "doc": "U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris has made equal pay a centerpiece of her Democratic campaign for president. In late May, she unveiled a plan to require employers to disclose pay data, under penalty of being fined if they fall short of paying their workers equally, regardless of gender. A few days after launching the proposal, Harris appeared on CBS\u2019s \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" During the interview, Harris discussed her efforts to promote equal pay. Here\u2019s an exchange from the May 22 show, starting about two-thirds of the way through the clip: Harris: \"The law says that men and women should be paid equally for equal work, but what we know is that in America today, women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work. African American women, 61 cents on the dollar, Latinas 53 cents on the dollar. And these are actually not debatable points.\" Colbert: \"So this is not hours worked, on average. This is hour for hour.\" Harris: \"Yeah, and for the same work. Or it could be the annual salary, but it\u2019s for the same work.\" Harris\u2019 figures for African American women and Latinas are correct, as long as you compare those groups to white, non-Hispanic men working full-time and year-round, a distinction that Harris didn\u2019t specify. However, there\u2019s a bigger problem with what Harris said \u2014 that women are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid \"for the same work.\" In a nutshell, Harris incorrectly explained the meaning of the gender wage gap. The 80 percent figure is not an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work. Instead, it refers to average pay for all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women. When we reached out to the Harris campaign, they quickly acknowledged that Harris had misspoken, even after being prodded on the point by Colbert. Spokesman Ian Sams pointed out that Harris\u2019 plan does not use the \"for the same work\" formulation. The most recent official data on this point, published by the U.S. Census Bureau for 2017, showed that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did. That\u2019s up by a couple percentage points in recent years, though it did not significantly change between 2016 and 2017. As we\u2019ve written previously, the 80 percent figure does not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and the years of experience they\u2019ve had. So while the 80 percent figure may be used to signify some facets of women\u2019s challenges in the workplace \u2014 such as disproportionate representation in fields that offer more flexible work schedules, even if that means earning less \u2014 the statistic cannot be used to pinpoint pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work. Other studies have shown a significantly closer match for men and women holding the same jobs. For instance, a 2013 study by the American Association of University Women that evened out those factors found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. That\u2019s still a disparity, but it\u2019s about one-third as big as the figure Harris cited in her tweet. \"Adjusting for workers\u2019 hours of work narrows the gender gap below the gap mentioned by Sen. Harris,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \"Adjusting for workers\u2019 age, educational attainment, and years of work experience also reduces the gap slightly.Making additional adjustments for workers\u2019 industry, occupation, and size of employer reduces the gap even more.\" While career choices may be shaped to a certain extent by gender, \"we do not know how much discriminatory \u2018herding\u2019 there is,\" he said. It\u2019s worth noting that the wage gap varies industry-by-industry. For instance, women working as cooks earn about 91 percent of what male cooks make, but women in retail sales earn just 74 percent of what their male equivalents earn, according to calculations by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. In an article for the job site Indeed.com in May 2019, economist Martha Gimbel cited research suggesting that \"occupation and industry differences between men and women explain about half of the gender pay gap because men are more likely to work in occupations with higher pay.\" Harris said, \"In America today, women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work.\" The 80 percent figure compares pay for all working women to pay for all working men, so it\u2019s wrong for Harris to characterize it as a comparison between women and men doing the same work. Research has shown a pay gap for women and men doing the same work, but it\u2019s narrower than 80 cents on the dollar. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Milwaukee has less taxing power than most similar cities and is the only U.S. city of 400,000 or more \"that does not have a sales tax or local income tax.\"",
        "doc": "Citing stagnant revenue from the state and an increasing financial pinch, Milwaukee-area leaders are pushing the state to sign off on a 1% county sales tax. The move, which could bring in as much as $160 million per year, would raise the sales tax in Milwaukee County to 6.5%. Officials want to introduce a binding referendum allowing residents to decide on the tax increase themselves, but in Wisconsin the Republican-controlled Legislature must also sign off on the plan. So people like Milwaukee MayorTom Barrett, a Democrat, must make the case to both voters and political opponents why this tax hike is needed. Here is what he said in doing so onWISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront.\" \"In many, many other states, you\u2019ve got different treatment for the largest metropolitan area,\" Barrett said in his Sept. 15, 2019 appearance. \"We are, the last time I checked, the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that doesn\u2019t have either a sales tax or a local income tax. We are just hamstrung because of the rules of the state.\" So Barrett is making the general case that Milwaukee has less flexibility than its peers, while specifically claiming no other city of its size gets by without a local tax of some kind. We\u2019ll examine both of those. The first element of Barrett\u2019s claim is that Milwaukee doesn\u2019t have the same options for raising tax revenue as other large cities. For more than a century, Wisconsin has used state income and sales taxes to provide aid \u2014 called shared revenue \u2014 to local governments, while generally not allowing local governments to levy those taxes themselves, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group. The main exception is a half-cent \"piggyback\" sales tax counties are allowed to levy on the same items taxed by the state. Other exceptions include stadium districts. Thecurrent sales tax throughout Milwaukee County is 5.6%, which includes a 5% state sales tax, a 0.5% county sales tax (since 1991) and a 0.1% stadium tax for Miller Park (since 1996). The stadium tax is expected to end by next year. Many other states don\u2019t have such an oversight requirement, giving local government the freedom to make independent decisions on tax increases. Some examples: In Hillsborough County, Florida, which includes Tampa,voters passed two referendums in late 2018 that raised sales taxes by 1.5 cents on the dollar for transportation and schools. The Albuquerque City Council voted in 2018 to impose athree-eighths cent tax, raising about $52 million per year. The large Hennepin and Ramsey counties around the Twin Cities voted tolevy a half-cent sales tax for transportation in 2017, raising about $100 million annually between the two counties. But not all states have such a system. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, reports 37 states allow local governments to impose their own general sales taxes. Wisconsin is tricky to categorize. Counties may choose to adopt the 0.5% county sales tax, but not all of them do. The state Department of Revenue reports Manitowoc, Menominee, Outagamie, Racine, Waukesha and Winnebago counties have no county sales tax. The Tax Policy Center lists Wisconsin among the states that allow local sales taxes. But a2017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum (then the Public Policy Forum) listed Wisconsin among the states with no local sales tax power, since only counties have that ability and it\u2019s capped at 0.5%. That policy forum report noted this has caused increasing problems in Milwaukee: \"Wisconsin\u2019s strong state aid historically has compensated for the lack of local revenue diversity. However, cutbacks in shared revenue have diminished this program\u2019s purchasing power and required Milwaukee to lean heavily on increased property taxes and fees to offset the impact.\" A 2019 policy forum report said stagnant shared revenue combined with state caps on property taxes has led to mounting questions about \"whether local officials can sustain appropriate service levels in areas such as public safety, streets, librariesand parks.\" This brings us to Barrett\u2019s more specific claim \u2014 that Milwaukee is the only city of 400,000 or more in the nation without a local sales or income tax. The2017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum compared Milwaukee to 38 peer cities around the country. They reported 30 of those cities had a general local sales tax, and the remaining eight each drew revenue from a \"selective sales taxes and/or other forms of taxation besides the property tax.\" That report excluded cities like Indianapolis and Boston from the comparison since they have different funding mechanisms than Milwaukee. Indianapolis performs some typical county functions, and Boston has school district funds pass through its budget. We asked Barrett\u2019s office for details on where his claim originated, and they forwarded us to Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Department of City Development. He said Barrett\u2019s claim was based on that policy forum report. But Barrett referred to cities by size, not to the limited peer group in the study. And that makes a difference. Boston has a population well over 400,000 and does not have a local sales tax or income tax, according to anAugust 2019 report from the Tax Foundation,a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. We\u2019ll assume Barrett was referring to cities that don\u2019t levy their own local sales tax, since otherwise Milwaukee wouldn\u2019t meet his criteria given that city residents are subject to the county\u2019s local sales tax. And in that case other cities join Boston on the list of exceptions to Barrett\u2019s claim. Indianapolis does not levy its own sales or income tax, but Marion County imposes a local income tax there,according to the Tax Foundation. And Portland, Oregon, has no city-issued sales or income tax, but residents there pay an income tax to a regional transportation district. Barrett said Milwaukee faces unusual taxing challenges and is \"the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that does not have a sales tax or local income tax.\" Barrett is essentially on target with the general claim that Milwaukee is in the minority nationally. Wisconsin is one of about a dozen states that authorizes cities to assess only property taxes \u2014 not sales or income taxes. But his core statistical claim is wrong. Several other cities larger than 400,000 do not impose their own sales or income tax. We define Half True this way: \"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\" That fits here.",

        "claim": "A document discovered in May 2019 reveals that Donald Trump's IQ was measured at 73 during his high school years.",
        "doc": "The IQ of U.S. President Donald Trump has been a subject of speculation since the early days of the 2016 presidential election cycle. During that campaign, for example, we investigated a false rumor that Trump had the second highest IQ (156) of all presidents in U.S. history. In May 2019, we encountered a rumor claiming the opposite: that Trump\u2019s IQ was a lowly 73 (placing him in the \u201cwell below average\u201d classification). This rumor circulated in the form of an image that showed a purported newspaper clipping about the recent discovery of information regarding an IQ test Trump allegedly took during his first year at New York Military Academy (NYMA): Trump IQ test results discovered in former NYMA employee\u2019s closet. The result: 73 The results of an IQ test that President Donald Trump allegedly took during his first year at New York Military Academy have been discovered in a file box in a closet in Brooklyn. According to the test results, Trump\u2019s IQ is 73. The document, currently in the process of being authenticated, was discovered Thursday by William Askew, Jr. as he was cleaning out his late father\u2019s apartment. \u201cDad was the school counselor at NYMA from 1955 to 1985. He didn\u2019t administer these tests, but he was in charge of collecting them and sending them to the grading office,\u201d said Askew. Askew produced additional documents and photographs that confirm his father was indeed employed as school counselor at NYMA at the same time Trump attended the military prep school. \u201cI don\u2019t think this should be news to anybody,\u201d said Askew. \u201cThe guy\u2019s clearly a total moron.\u201d However, this image was not, and did not reflect, a genuine newspaper clipping. While we aren\u2019t entirely sure where this story originated, we turned up no mention of it on any credible news website. In fact, we couldn\u2019t find the story published anywhere. The only version that appears to exist is the image version shown above. In other words, it appears that this story was fabricated specifically for the creation of this meme. Furthermore, the images included in the fake clipping do not show a man by the name of \u201cWilliam Askew Jr.\u201d or Askew\u2019s late father, who was supposedly Trump\u2019s former school counselor. The photograph claimed to be that of Askew Jr. was taken from a stock photography website: The image allegedly showing Trump\u2019s former school counselor at New York Military Academy actually depicts a man named Lawrence Hanson, who was the principal at Grand Forks (North Dakota) Central High School in 1950. The image is available via the Grand Forks Central High School website, where it is presented with the following caption: 1950 Principal Hanson: Mr. Lawrence W. Hanson\u2019s first year as principal at Central was the 1949-1950 school year. It was Mr. Hanson\u2019s responsibility to see that Central maintained high standards of education. Mr. Hanson had been the principal at Central Junior High School from 1942-1949 before taking over at the high school. He carried the responsibility of managing Central \u2013 one of North Dakota\u2019s largest schools. Whoever cobbled this meme together included two photographs in an attempt to lend this story a bit more credence. However, what these unrelated images show is that the meme is nothing more than junk news aimed at disparaging President Trump. While Trump has chastised his political opponents for being what he called \u201clow-IQ individuals\u201d and has frequently boasted about having a high IQ himself, he has provided no documentation of his own IQ score. While we may not know what Trump\u2019s actual IQ score is, neither does the creator of this meme.",

We won all these swing states by a lot.\u201d \u201cYou look at the things that happened in Detroit,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou have more votes than you have voters \u2026 think of it, more votes than you had voters.\u201d In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2020 As with many similar Trump claims about election fraud, this one was easily disproved by simply referencing the relevant statistics. According to the City of Detroit\u2019s website, that area was home to 504,714 registered voters in 2020, of whom 250,138 (i.e., just less than half) cast ballots in that year\u2019s general election: Furthermore, none of these voting statistics is inconsistent with the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s population estimates for Detroit. As other reports noted, Trump appeared to be misunderstanding the concept of \u201cout-of-balance\u201d precincts, which had little to no effect on the outcome of the presidential race in Michigan: Trump appears to be referring to \u201cout-of-balance\u201d precincts where the number of votes counted is slightly different from the number of voters checked into a polling place \u2014 but these mismatches are not evidence of fraud, and instead are usually routine errors like poll-workers incorrectly scanning voters\u2019 names, failing to record spoiled ballots, or not noticing if a voter leaves the precinct without casting a ballot, city officials say. Detroit has reported only 357 mismatched votes across all out-of-balance precincts, Mayor Mike Duggan said, which is less than 0.2% of the total ballots cast citywide.",

        "claim": "An unburned Bible was found amidst the charred wreckage of the Pentagon after the September 11 terrorist attack.",
        "doc": "On 11 September 2001, American Airlines Flight 77, one of four airliners hijacked by terrorists that day, slammed into the southwest section of the Pentagon (a sprawling defense office complex in Washington, D.C.) killing 189 people. Half of the building remains closed because of smoke and structural damage. As search-and-rescue workers scoured the damaged building over the next few days, they encountered grisly scenes: One of the first recovery personnel to enter the crippled headquarters building after a hijacked Boeing 757 smashed into it, the urban search-and-rescue specialist found a gruesome sight. \u201cIf anyone has ever burned a pot roast, they\u2019ll know what the victims looked like,\u201d Williams, 30, said Thursday after another 12-hour shift of searching for 190 bodies \u2014 those of 126 missing Pentagon personnel and the 64 aboard the doomed jetliner. The fireball produced when the jetliner\u2019s full fuel tank exploded on impact roared down corridors so fast that \u201c90% didn\u2019t know what happened to them,\u201d he said. Many were sitting at their desks or behind partitions. One woman was found frozen in a sitting position, her arms posed as if reading a document. Several bodies were found huddled in groups near televisions. Pentagon workers were apparently watching the carnage taking place at the World Trade Center when the hellish scene on TV became reality for them, too. When Williams discovered the scorched bodies of several airline passengers, they were still strapped into their seats. The stench of charred flesh overwhelmed him. Williams, the search-and-rescue specialist quoted in this USA Today article, also described scenes both heart-rending and surprising: \u201cThere is somebody in there who I knew,\u201d Williams said quietly. The victim was the husband of one of Williams\u2019 co-workers, a senior enlisted soldier who worked right near the point of impact and is almost certainly among thedead. Yet, as he looked up into the black chasm torn into the symbol of the mightiest military in the world, Williams saw a sign of hope. On a second floor, right next to where the jet sheared off a section of the building, was an undisturbed stool. And on it was a thick, open book. Fellow searchers who had gotten a close look said it was a Bible. It was not burned. Nor was anything around it or on the two floors above it. \u201cI\u2019m not as religious as some, but that would have me thinking,\u201d the soldier said. \u201cI just can\u2019t explain it.\u201d A book did remain relatively unscathed in an office in a heavily-damaged section of the Pentagon, but the USA Today account was inaccurate, a single-source, second-hand anecdote (only one person was quoted, and he himself did not see the book in question) based on wishful thinking. Other on-scene news crews such as CNN reported that the book was a dictionary, as verified for us by a reader who went back and reviewed the tape of that day\u2019s news: Like many I was recording everything that day and many others after. I did remember the \u2018book\u2019 in question though it took me the better part of a day to find that point on the tape. CNN zoomed in on it, it was as you said, on a \u2018podium\u2019 against a wall with maybe a foot to eighteen inches of ledge (once floor) remaining. Beyond it was nothing. They were interested, zoomed in very close. It was a library style dictionary, not a bible. It did not appear damaged. I\u2019ve an older version of that style book here in my home. This is the massive break your back style with two to three thousand thin pages. Apparently it was in a research area or small library \u2014 as you may recall they had just finished the new library but had only moved furniture into it. A week or two later and the dictionary most likely would have been in the new library, not where it was. Additionally, an acquaintance of ours who works in Pentagon security had access to the area in question and shared with us his own detailed photographs of the office containing the book; they too demonstrated to us that the book was indeed a dictionary, not a Bible. In February 2002, the New York Post reported that a photographer had found a single page from a Bible under the rubble of the World Trade Center: Buried under tons of World Trade Center steel and rubble, rescue workers found a page from the Bible that spoke of a tower that reached to the heavens. The shocking revelation of faith and hope is \u201ca sign from God that he is still watching over us,\u201d said photographer and actor Gary Gere, who found the passage from Genesis, about the Tower of Babel, amid the ruins. \u201cAfter more than 93 days of fires, a skinny little frail page from the Bible survived. I find it quite unbelievable,\u201d he told The Post.",

        "claim": "The Hispanic population in Gwinnett and Henry counties has increased by 153 percent and 339 percent, respectively, since 2000 while Republican presidential candidates are getting a smaller percentage of the vote in those counties.",
        "doc": "Karl Rove, the chief political strategist behind George W. Bush\u2019s two White House victories, has been telling anyone who\u2019d listen that the Republican Party must do better with nonwhites if it wants to get a Republican back in the Oval Office. Rove said that at the Georgia GOP\u2019s convention in May, with details about how Republicans have done well among Hispanic voters in Texas by aggressively recruiting Hispanic candidates for office and conducting other outreach efforts. He offered some statistics to outline the potential trouble for Georgia Republicans if they do not employ a similar approach here. \"If the GOP leaves nonwhite voters to the Democrats, then its margins in safe congressional districts and red states will dwindle \u2014 not overnight, but over years and decades,\" Rowe wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. \"For example, the Hispanic population in Georgia's Gwinnett County increased by 153 percent from 2000 to 2010 while the GOP's presidential vote in the county dropped to 54 percent in 2012 from 63.7 percent in 2000. In Henry County, south of Atlanta, the Hispanic population increased by 339 percent over the same decade. The GOP's presidential vote dropped to 51.2 percent in 2012 from 66.4 percent in 2000. Republicans ignore changes like these at their peril.\" PolitiFact Georgia hadn\u2019t seen such detailed numbers, so we wondered whether Rove was accurate and was there any context missing. Gwinnett and Henry counties had an explosion in population growth in recent decades. Gwinnett\u2019s population has increased nearly fivefold since 1980, from 166,903 residents to the 2010 U.S. census estimate of 805,321. Henry, meanwhile, consistently made the Top 10 list of America\u2019s fastest-growing counties in the early 2000s. Henry\u2019s population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010, from 119,341 to 203,923. The once-rural counties in the Atlanta area have been reliable Republican terrain in statewide and national elections, and Rove wants it to stay that way. Hispanics represent a significant portion of the population increase. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in March 2011 that Henry County\u2019s Hispanic population had increased by 338 percent between 2000 and 2010, from 2,693 up to 11,813. Gwinnett\u2019s Hispanic population grew from 64,136 in 2000 to 162,035 in 2010, the AJC reported. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 153 percent. The percentage increases we found were almost the same as what Rove wrote in his op-ed. So far, so good for Rove\u2019s claim. As for the recent performance of Republican presidential candidates, Rove was on target as well, according to our review of Georgia secretary of state records. In 2000, Bush, the Republican nominee for president, won approximately 64.2 percent of the vote in Gwinnett County. Last year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney pulled 53.9 percent of Gwinnett voters. In Henry County, Bush garnered 66.5 percent of the vote in 2000 while Romney won 51.2 percent of the vote in 2012. Rove implies a correlation between the increase of Hispanic residents in Gwinnett and Henry and the performance of Republican presidential nominees in those counties, even though he doesn\u2019t draw a direct connection. Most exit polls show about one-third of Hispanic voters nationwide cast their ballots for Bush in 2000, which was considered a good showing for a Republican. Bush courted Hispanic voters by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail in 2000 and distancing himself from GOP immigration positions unpopular among most Hispanics. The nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center reported Romney did not receive the same level of support in 2012, pulling in about 27 percent of Hispanic voters. Polls showed many Hispanic voters were dismayed by Romney\u2019s position and the Republican Party platform on immigration reform, particularly their stance on tougher border patrols. If Hispanic voters in the two counties simply liked Bush\u2019s policies better than Romney\u2019s, could that have accounted for the county\u2019s overall decrease in support for the GOP in 2012? Kristin Davison, Rove\u2019s chief of staff, referred us to past comments in which Rove said Republicans can do better with Hispanic voters with the right policies and better messaging. Census numbers, though, cast doubt on whether Hispanics had enough clout in the two counties to sway the presidential vote outcome. By 2010, Hispanics formed about a fifth of Gwinnett\u2019s population, up from about 11 percent in 2000. In Henry County, Hispanics made up just under 6 percent of the population in 2010, compared with 2 percent in 2000. But the voting-age population of Hispanics in each county was smaller, and many Hispanic adults weren\u2019t registered to vote. William Boone, a longtime political science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said the black vote is a critical element that must be considered when examining presidential election voting patterns in Georgia. Boone observed Rove\u2019s lone reference to African-American voters was in the final paragraph of his op-ed. \"I think what is missing from his equation is the black vote is increasing in Gwinnett, in Henry, in Rockdale (County) and throughout the state,\" said Boone, who noted that black voter turnout is greater than Hispanic voter turnout in Georgia. Census numbers indicate that the African-American population in the two counties was large enough and active enough at the polls that they could have had a significant influence on the presidential election. In Gwinnett, African-Americans accounted for almost 24 percent of the population in 2010, up from just over 13 percent in 2000. The number of African-American Gwinnett residents who voted tripled between the 2000 and 2012 elections, state records show. In Henry, African-Americans made up almost 37 percent of the population in 2010, up from about 15 percent in 2000. In Henry, the increase in those who voted was sixfold, records show. In 2012, the number of African-Americans who voted in those counties was 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the number of Hispanics who voted, state records show. Georgia did not track how many Hispanics voted in 2000. Exit polls found Democrat Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first African-American president, won about 95 percent of the black vote nationwide in 2012. Al Gore, the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate in 2000, won 92 percent of the black vote. Davison said Rove doesn\u2019t believe that nationwide exit poll results can be applied to specific counties. Still, Davison stressed that Rove\u2019s overall point was that the GOP needs to do better among all racial groups. \"So, if Republicans rely solely on white voters ... these counties will likely no longer be safe GOP counties as the nonwhite population continues to grow,\" Davison said. Rove\u2019s numbers were either identical or very close to what our research found. But his emphasis on Hispanic numbers implied a greater influence on the election outcome in the two counties than they brought. African-American voters, who got cursory mention in his remarks, may have had a larger influence on the performance of GOP presidential candidates in those counties. That context is necessary to fully consider why GOP candidates did not do as well in Gwinnett and Henry counties. We rate Rove\u2019s statement Mostly True.",

        "doc": "CLAIM \u201c60% of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in England have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine\u201d more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Anonymous, Disclose.tv, 19 Jul. 2021 DETAILS Factually inaccurate: A declaration on 19 July 2021 by the U.K. Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, stated that 60% of hospitalized people for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, not vaccinated. Lack of context: While Vallance did initially state that 60% of hospitalized patients were vaccinated, he later corrected himself, saying that he was referring to unvaccinated patients instead. Several social media posts failed to correct their content to reflect Vallance\u2019s correction, or persisted in repeating Vallance\u2019s inaccurate statement even after he had corrected it, misleading users into believing that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective. KEY TAKE AWAY The U.K. saw a new surge of COVID-19 cases in June and July 2021, mostly due to the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is more contagious than previous variants. However, the COVID-19 vaccines remain efficient against that variant and the majority of people hospitalized for COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated group. FULL CLAIM: \u201c60% of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in England have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the government's chief scientific adviser\u201d REVIEW The U.K. was one of the first countries to initiate its nationwide vaccination campaign against COVID-19 on 8 December 2020. As of 22 July 2021, more than 36 million people received two doses and are thus fully vaccinated. This represents 69% of the population above 18. In spite of the progress in vaccination, the country saw the beginning of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in June 2021, mostly due to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant which appears to be more contagious than the original version of the virus. Some took advantage of this surge in COVID-19 cases to claim that this was evidence that vaccines weren\u2019t efficient or even useless against the disease circulated on the internet. For instance, this post sharing a screenshot of a tweet by Disclose.tv claimed that 60% of the people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the U.K. were fully vaccinated. The tweet, which has since been deleted (archived here), shared a Sky News article (archived here) that reported a statement by Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government\u2019s Chief Scientific Advisor, who had initially given such a figure in a public declaration. Disclose.tv, which is owned by a German company, has been classified as a conspiracy-pseudoscience source according to Media Bias/Fact Check. However, this claim is inaccurate, as Vallance himself pointed out later on Twitter: \u201cAbout 60% of hospitalisations from covid are not from double vaccinated people, rather 60% of hospitalisations from covid are currently from unvaccinated people.\u201d [emphasis added] While Sky News did correct its article to reflect Vallance\u2019s correction, not all who shared its article or Vallance\u2019s initial statement corrected their own content, thus misleading some social media users into believing the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective. Based on Vallance\u2019s corrected statement, the majority of hospitalizations are actually among unvaccinated people, even though they only represent a minority of the adult population (31%), as of 22 July 2021. This is similar to the situation in the U.S. at the moment, where almost all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are from unvaccinated patients, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These findings indicate that unvaccinated people are more vulnerable to the disease and highlight the protective effect of vaccines. In fact, the U.K. government estimated that vaccination already prevented 30,000 deaths, 46,000 hospitalizations, and more than 8 million cases in a 8 July 2021 report. The fact that vaccinated people still represent 40% of hospitalizations isn\u2019t surprising and doesn\u2019t indicate a lack of efficiency. Public Health England reports that the Pfizer-BioNTech and the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccines have 96% and 92% efficiency against hospitalization due to the Delta variant, respectively. This efficiency is high, but there is no vaccine that is 100% effective, therefore a small percentage of vaccinated people might still be ill enough to require hospitalization. Over time, more and more people are getting vaccinated. As Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford, explained, all cases of hospitalization would necessarily come from vaccinated patients if we were in a situation where 100% of the population is vaccinated. This wouldn\u2019t be because the vaccine is inefficient, but simply because the entire population is vaccinated, so any hospitalization, albeit very rare, would involve a vaccinated patient. But in contrast to a population that is unvaccinated, a vaccinated population would see far fewer cases that require hospitalization.",

Patrick Rose of San Marcos, seeking re-election in a district whose voters preferred Republican John McCain for president in 2008, depicted the GOP nominee as a high-tax advocate in a recent TV ad that debuted online Sept. 24.To creepy music in the background and grainy video of the challenger, Jason Isaac, the ad's narrator says Isaac \"supports higher sales taxes. The tax plan he's peddling means Texans would pay the highest sales taxes in America, up to 14.5 percent. So if Isaac gets his way, you'll pay more for every loaf of bread, every prescription, everything you buy in Texas.\"Another Rose ad revisits the tax-hike warning about Isaac with: \"Hey Jason, you can't be serious.\"Gutsy or whack, is Isaac selling a tax surge?Rose's campaign consultant, Randy Thompson, shared a transcript of an Aug. 17 interview of Isaac on an Internet radio program titled \"Texas Sons of Liberty Riders.\" We verified the transcript after Isaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, provided a web link to the archived audio.On the show, Isaac said he favors lowering the 10 percent state cap on annual increases in home appraisals to 3 percent and eventually wiping out property taxes altogether.Isaac also told the hosts that lost revenue from eliminating property taxes could be recovered from higher sales taxes, saying: \"A lot of people like the consumption-based model and there's a group out there, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, they released a study earlier this year that said if you just eliminated property taxes and you wanted to make a pure consumption (tax) base... sales tax is an easier way to put it.\"Isaac then said: \"You increase the sales tax to 14 and a half percent and you've got a wash. It balances out. You could eliminate all your property taxes but everything you buy, you pay a 14 and a half percent tax.\"We confirmed that in April 2009, the conservative-leaning Austin-based public policy foundation issued a report on wiping out property taxes and replacing that revenue with sales taxes. The study says that if the sales tax is limited to items it now covers, it would need to be raised to about 14.5 percent. If it were expanded to all property sales, the state rate could be 12.5 percent, the study says, and if expanded to cover \"all services taxed by at least one other state,\" the rate could be 9 percent.A sales tax rate of 14.5 percent would--take a breath-- more than double the current Texas rate of 6.25 percent, on which local jurisdictions may tack on up to 2 percent more. As of January, California's 8.25 percent statewide sales tax was the highest in the country, according to the Washington-based Federation of Tax Administrators.But there was more to Isaac's interview than talking up a sales tax hike, which he noted could also be counterproductive: \"My thought process is you get above 9 and a half (percent sales tax) and you're gonna start driving people to the black market... they're gonna order everything off of Amazon.com... But I like the consumption-based model.\"In a follow-up e-mail, Rose's consultant, Thompson, said Isaac has failed to tell voters precisely how he'd replace the lost property tax revenue. Thompson shared a transcript from a Sept. 12 forum in which Isaac concedes he doesn't have the answer, aside from using money from the state's so-called rainy day fund. \"But,\" Isaac said, according to the transcript, \"I believe if you start to cut property taxes, your tax base is going to grow\" because more people will be able to afford homes and more people will buy more goods and services, resulting in greater sales-tax revenue.\" Isaac reaffirmed that position in an interview with us. He also said that while he favors wiping out property taxes, \"I don't have the answers\" on how to replace the revenue.Isaac's campaign, responding to Rose's ad, distributed a statement saying Isaac does not support raising the state sales tax rate to 14.5 percent, but believes \"Texans deserve options to create a more sustainable tax model and that we need creative new solutions in this tough economy.\" On his campaign website, Isaac states he \"believes that a consumption-based model is one possible solution, but there are limitations.\"So, Isaac wants Texas property taxes to go to zero sometime. He says he's uncertain how to get there, yet he supports the \"consumption\" model, meaning a reliance on sales taxes. And he approvingly referred to a study by a conservative group showing that one way to eliminate property taxes in Texas is to raise the state sales tax to 14.5 percent.Contrary to Rose's statement, though, there's no sign Isaac is peddling a plan to bump the state sales tax to 14.5 percent--indeed, there's flat-out no plan to peddle. Still, there's a shred of truth to Rose's statement because Isaac has saluted the idea of swapping higher sales taxes for cuts in property taxes.We rate the statement Barely True.",

A disturbing video purportedly showing one of the alleged murderers of Kanhaiya Lal getting assaulted has gone viral on social media. The video shows a man tied up and being held onto a cot by another man. Two other men were seen whipping and beating the former. No one\u2019s face is visible in the video. Only the sounds of a man crying in pain can be heard aside from the sound of the blows. here. Archived versions of such a tweet can be seen AFWA\u2019s investigation found that this video had nothing to do with Kanhaiya Lal\u2019s killers at all. The video is at least four years old and allegedly shows custodial violence in Pakistan. AFWA Probe We reverse-searched grabs from the video on the Russian search engine Yandex, which led us to multiple YouTube videos. Some of these videos claimed that following the 2019 terrorist attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, this is how the Indian Army interrogated a suspect. On February 14, 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel was attacked by a suicide bomber in a vehicle in the Pulwama district. The attack killed 40 Indian CRPF personnel. Given that the videos were shared as early as February 2019, it\u2019s clear that they had nothing to do with the alleged killers of Kanhaiya Lal. But where is this video from? Around the 16 seconds mark of the viral video, we were able to spot what looked like the Pakistani flag on the uniform of the man seeing holding the victim down. When we compared it with Pakistan's flag on their army outfit, it became clear that the men in the video are likely Pakistani soldiers. We also compared the combat boots that were seen around the 1-minute-20-second-mark on the YouTube videos. A stock image of the Pakistani Army uniform on Alamy further clarified that the boots also looked similar. Subsequent searches helped find the same video tweeted by Sher Mohammad Bugti, a spokesperson of the Baloch Republican Party. While sharing this video in July 2018, Bugti claimed \u201cinhuman and degrading physical torture\u201d was carried out by the Pakistani Army on a student from Balochistan.

In September 2018, a Pakistani Journalist named Hamid Mir tweeted this video with the false claim that it showed Indian Army personnel torturing a Kashmiri man. However, the claim was debunked by the Times of India.

Ajay Chaturvedi confirmed that \"The Indian Army uses only black DMS (Directly Moduled Sole) boots. The Pakistani Army uses sand-coloured (or desert tan-coloured) tactical boots.\" An Indian Army officer told the Times of India that this video supposedly showed a Pashtun man being assaulted. Although we could not independently identify the victim or pinpoint to the location of the video, it is more than certain that the video is nearly four years old and not related to the Udaipur murder. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim This video shows how one of the alleged murderers of Kanhaiya Lal was brutally thrashed.

        "claim": "Says Alaska Sen. Mark Begich supported President Barack Obama\u2019s economic policies \"97 percent of the time.\"",
        "doc": "U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat, brands himself as being \"as independent as Alaska.\" Unsurprisingly, Republicans in the primary field for the 2014 midterm election versus Begich beg to differ. One such candidate, former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan, argued in a campaign email that Begich\u2019s votes are in line with President Barack Obama\u2019s positions on economic issues. \"Instead of standing up to President Obama\u2019s reckless economic policies, Mark Begich has supported them 97 percent of the time,\" the email read. \"By rubber-stamping overspending and over-regulation, Begich and Obama are stifling our nation\u2019s economic growth and standing in the way of job creation.\" Begich, Alaska\u2019s junior senator, faces re-election for the first time in November. The leading Republican challengers are Sullivan and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. Sullivan briefly served as attorney general. Since November 2010, he\u2019s been commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. This is his first run for public office. PolitiFact wanted to know if Begich and Obama really agree on economic issues 97 percent of the time. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers Sullivan\u2019s campaign office pointed us toward CQ Weekly\u2019s presidential position votes report. That\u2019s from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. That analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes where Obama \"took a clear position,\" Begich\u2019s vote matched the president\u2019s stance 97 percent of the time. In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes, or about 37 percent. We found the same trends across CQ reports since Begich took office in 2009. CQ put him voting with Obama over 90 percent of the time for each year served. This data looked at all votes, not just votes on economic policy. Also, all Democrats received 90 percent and higher ratings in the 2014 report. That shows that, in general, Democratic senators tend to vote with their president. CQ\u2019s Roll Call, on the other hand, offered a different picture of Begich\u2019s reputation in a profile of the race: \"Since entering the Senate, Begich, a former Anchorage mayor, has struck an independent pitch and continues to highlight his focus on Alaska issues, even when they swim upstream from the administration\u2019s priorities.\" That independence was reflected in a different congressional rating we looked at from OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service that tracks how often each senator votes with the majority of his or her caucus. OpenCongress then ranks the results within each party, giving a more detailed take on where individual senators fall on an ideological spectrum. In 2013, for example, OpenCongress said Begich voted with the majority of Democrats 87.1 percent of the time. That\u2019s based on all 291 Senate votes. OpenCongress ranked Begich at 45th for 2013 when it comes to voting with his party. That shows that Begich is among the most independent senators currently serving. Both the CQ and OpenCongress data focus on senators\u2019 overall voting record, not specifically on economic policy, as Sullivan\u2019s claim said. On economic policy, Begich voted against the March 2013 Senate budget proposal passed by nearly every other Democrat. Begich has also opposed Democratic measures in favor of free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, and legislation that would put more taxes on the oil and gas industry. \"National Democrats often try to pay for something with oil and gas taxes,\" Begich told Politico in January. \"And I have to explain that ain\u2019t happening: That ain\u2019t happening over my dead body.\" Our ruling Sullivan\u2019s campaign email claimed Begich supports Obama\u2019s economic policies 97 percent of the time. The statistic the campaign offered looked at all Senate legislation, not just economic policy. Most Democrats scored 90 percent or higher. In another vote analysis that ranked Democrats according to party loyalty, Begich ranked only 45th. Notably, he\u2019s crossed his party on economic issues like yearly budgeting and oil taxes. Sullivan\u2019s claim hinges on one statistic in a way that doesn\u2019t accurately reflect Begich\u2019s voting record on economic policy. We rated this claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "When he was Milwaukee County executive, \"eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year.\"",
        "doc": "Wisconsin Democrats such as U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan say they believe Republican Gov. Scott Walker will run again for president, even though his 2016 candidacy was short lived. And Walker, eying a run for a third term as governor in 2018, continues to stake out positions that draw praise from conservatives around the country, such as aiming to make Wisconsin the first state to drug test Medicaid recipients. Walker even touts his record as Milwaukee County executive, the job he held previously. He did so in a June 5, 2017 interview with Jerry Bader, a conservative radio talk show host in Green Bay, saying: \"Eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year.\" It\u2019s true that Walker never proposed to increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and that he tried, with vetoes, to stave off levy increases approved by the County Board of Supervisors. But saying he \"pushed through budgets\" suggests he was successful, when in fact he largely was not: In eight of Walker\u2019s nine years as county executive, the levy increased. Let\u2019s take a look. Walker\u2019s evidence Walker proposed nine county budgets, for 2003 through 2011, before taking office as governor in January 2011. Working with a left-leaning County Board, typically there was a tug-of-war in which Walker tended toward lower property taxes and less spending, while the board would aim for more. Often there were Walker vetoes and veto overrides by the board. To back Walker\u2019s claim, his staff pointed us to figures from the Milwaukee County budget archive. For his first two budgets, for 2003 and 2004, Walker proposed a property tax levy lower than what the County Board had adopted the previous year. But for both budgets, the County Board adopted levies higher than what Walker proposed. Ultimately, the levy rose in 2003 and dropped in 2004. Then a routine developed: 1. Walker would propose for his new budget a levy that was the same amount as the previous year\u2019s levy. 2. The County Board would override Walker vetoes and adopt a budget that included a levy higher than what Walker proposed. 3. Walker would use that increased levy as his proposed levy for the next year\u2019s budget. For example: Walker\u2019s proposed levy of $225.9 million for 2006 was exactly the same as the levy that the County Board had adopted for 2005. But the levy that the board approved for 2006 was higher -- $232.6 million. And that was the levy Walker then made in his budget proposal for 2007. Here are the figures for the county budgets during Walker\u2019s tenure: Year Recommended property tax levy and change up or down from previous adopted levy Adopted property tax levy $ and change up or down from previous adopted levy 2002 218.7,734,713 2003 218,708,524 \u2193 219,494.183 \u2191 2004 219,425,702 \u2193 219,436.418 \u2193 2005 219.416,093 \u2193 225,883,651 \u2191 2006 225,883,651 -- 232,592,517 \u2191 2007 232,592,517 -- 241,047,846 \u2191 2008 $241,047,846 -- $249,889,950 \u2191 2009 $249,889,950 -- $257,637,284 \u2191 2010 $257,637,284 -- $263,264,740 \u2191 2011 $262,264,740 -- $269,554,701 \u2191 As we noted, Walker frequently used his veto in an attempt to freeze the property tax levy. For example, he vetoed all of the increase in tax levy spending that the County Board added in the 2011 budget. But the board overrode the vetoes. Our rating Walker says that when he was Milwaukee County executive, \"eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year.\" It was actually nine straight years that Walker proposed budgets that did not increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected. But, to say he \"pushed through budgets\" that did not increase the levy is wrong. In eight of the nine years, the budgets adopted by the County Board -- over Walker\u2019s vetoes -- raised the levy. And each year, Walker would use that increased levy as his proposal for the next year\u2019s budget. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we rate Walker\u2019s claim Mostly False.",

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 gave the U.S. Marshals Service, a unit of the Justice Department, the authority to help local officials find missing children. The bill passed in Congress with bipartisan support and former President Barack Obama signed it into law in May 2015. By 2016, according to the agency\u2019s annual report and a fact sheet, the Marshals Service had created a Missing Child Unit to help federal, state and local law enforcement locate \u201cmissing, endangered or abducted children, regardless of whether a fugitive or sex offender was involved.\u201d This unit was created before US President Donald Trump took office. The U.S. Marshals Missing Child Unit conducted operations in 2018 and 2020 to locate children listed as missing. Many of them turned out to be where they lived or belonged. In the October 2018 operation, U.S. Marshals reported that a one-day sting operation in Michigan resulted in the recovery of more than 100 missing children. The operation \u201csought to identify and recover 301 missing children, with an emphasis on locating victims of sex trafficking,\u201d according to news reports. Local officials reported that 107 children were found, and 103 of those children were \u201ceither at home or where they belonged.\u201d In August 2020, the Missing Child Unit, along with state and local agencies, conducted a two-week operation known as \"Operation Not Forgotten\" that found 39 missing children in Georgia. Additionally, investigators cleared 26 arrest warrants and filed additional charges for crimes related to sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs, and weapons possession, and custodial interference announced in a press release on August 27, 2020. There is no evidence that Trump created a child protective force or that his administration found more than 300 missing children in less than 30 days.

At least 22 posts we first noticed on April 10, 2017, on the website CountyNewsroom.info carried headlines that declared, \"2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash,\" followed by the name of a county, such as Stark County or Schuyler County. Facebook users flagged multiple versions of the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. The story is fake, although it does steal details from a real event (more on that in a second). The posts at CountyNewsroom.info appear to exist to goad readers into clicking on them because a familiar county name is used. When users get to the site, however, pornographic malware can be downloaded onto their computers. We won\u2019t be linking to any of the stories for that reason. The site made a minimal attempt to look official, using the CountyNewsroom.info domain and listing the author of the posts as \"Police.\" The graphics used evoke breaking news from a real media outlet, and can change from post to post. Some of the articles have comments posted expressing sympathy for the victims, although it\u2019s not entirely clear if those comments are real or not. There is no contact information on the website, but it is registered to an administrator in Tbilisi, Georgia. The small country in the Caucasus has been a growing source of multiple fake news websites since the 2016 presidential campaign. We emailed the person listed in the WHOIS lookup, but have not heard back. The story, meanwhile, gives no indication in which state it is located, but the details of the accident are identical in each version. Two men \u2014 Carter Anderson, 35, and Nathan Mcconaghy, 47 \u2014 were the sole survivors of a crash that killed their families, the posts said. According to the story, the two men were in a minivan with their families when the minivan hit a black BMW on the side of the road. The minivan was then struck from behind by \"a big rig,\" sending the minivan toppling into a ravine. The minivan caught fire, the story read, and the two men managed to escape. Their wives and children, aged 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 years old, were trapped and died in the fire. The men were severely burned on their hands and faces trying to rescue their families, but had to be restrained by authorities. \"Words can\u2019t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene,\" a law enforcement official identified only as Officer Dan Williams was quoted in the posts. \"It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly.\" The two men were airlifted to an unspecified hospital, the article said. While that particular accident is fake, the framework of the article has been taken from a real-life tragedy in June 2016 near Gorman, Calif. Some, but not all, of the details were changed. Two California men named Aaron Hon Wing Ng, 34, of San Francisco and Wei Xiong Li, 45, of Daly City were involved in a nighttime accident that happened as described in the fake post. Their wives and four children, not five, were trapped in their minivan and killed in the fiery wreck. The children were aged 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the two men did suffer burns trying to save their families. The quote is unaltered, and came from a California Highway Patrol officer named Dan Williams. Another CHP officer also is quoted in some true reporting of the incident. The author of the post made minimal changes to real news stories about the accident, using the shocking specifics to fool readers into clicking. But visitors thinking they are reading about a local accident end up being fooled into exposing their computers to an attack with pornographic software. We rate this story False.",

R Kelly has been in jail since July 2019, awaiting trial. The trial was scheduled to begin in April 2020 but was then pushed to October of that year. A new trial date has been set for 13 September 2021. But does the photo show the Grammy Award-winner being released from jail in June 2021? We checked. Jailed for not paying child support A Google reverse image search of the photo reveals that it is more than two years old. It was taken in March 2019 by Associated Press journalist Paul Beaty. It can be found on the AP Images website . It's captioned : \"Singer R. Kelly left, walks with his attorney Steve Greenberg right, after being released from Cook County Jail, March 9, 2019, in Chicago. Kelly was freed three days after a judge ordered him jailed until he paid the total amount of back child support that he owed. \" Kelly on Federal Bureau of Prisons database Through the \"Find an inmate\" section of the Federal Bureau of Prisons database , we were able to trace a black male inmate with the name Robert Sylveste Kelly at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago. On 23 June 2021, US TV network CNN quoted Kelly's lawyers as saying the singer had been moved from the Chicago jail to a New York jail.",

FACT CHECK NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be fake. We checked the website of the Election Commission and found that no assembly elections were held in Uttar Pradesh in 1992. We also found that in 2002 UP Polls, though Samajwadi Party emerged as the single-largest party by winning 143 seats, it failed to prove its mandate. In 2002, BSP and BJP formed a coalition government. The government however collapsed in 2003 and SP President Mulayam Singh Yadav became UP Chief Minister on August 29, 2003 and continued till May 13, 2007. In the 2012 elections, Samajwadi Party won UP Polls by winning 224 of the 403 seats and Akhilesh Yadav became the Chief Minister.

        "claim": "\"Current projections indicate that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017, while Social Security will bottom out by 2037.\"",
        "doc": "You can\u2019t accuse Herman Cain of lacking confidence.Metro Atlanta\u2019s Republican hopeful for president ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004 without a lick of experience as an elected official. Now he\u2019s running for president without ever having served in public office. His new book, \"This is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House,\" treats victory as a foregone conclusion. Already, he\u2019s referring to himself as \"President Herman Cain.\" It\u2019s in more than a few places, including the title of Appendix A, \"The Major Issues of the Day, According to President Herman Cain.\" And President Herman Cain does not like what he sees. Entitlements, he said, are compromising the nation\u2019s financial stability.\"Current projections indicate that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017, while Social Security will bottom out by 2037,\" Cain said.These figures -- especially the Medicare estimate -- seemed awfully pessimistic. 2017 is only six years away.We contacted the Cain campaign and received no response, so we did our own research. We found that FactCheck.org, another fact-checking group, looked at similar statements. Cain\u2019s campaign website also offered some clues. His policy page makes an almost identical claim, citing a May 2009 article in Newsweek as support.The op-ed is by columnist Robert J. Samuelson, who argued that Medicare, which provides health care for seniors, and Social Security, which provides retirement income, will have to go bankrupt before lawmakers take funding problems seriously.Samuelson said current projections show those programs will go bankrupt in 2017 and 2037, the dates when the \"trust funds\" that back them are slated to run dry. Those are the same years Cain cited.First, we\u2019ll deal with Cain\u2019s statement that projections show Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017.FactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a nearly identical claim made in a TV ad for Americans for Prosperity, where Mark Block, the Cain campaign\u2019s chief operating officer, used to work. It checked another in April by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.As FactCheck.org concluded, Medicare does have big financial problems, but there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s going out of business.There are four parts to Medicare, and they\u2019re funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government.Part A covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices. It\u2019s paid for by the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes.Part B covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, while Part D covers prescription drugs. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund pays their bills, which are mostly covered by the federal government\u2019s general fund and premiums.Medicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn\u2019t have a trust fund. FactCheck.org\u2019s articles said that the SMI fund is in good shape, and we found it still is. It\u2019s \"projected to remain in financial balance for all future years,\" according to a 2011 report by the fund\u2019s trusteesBut the the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund? Not so much. As of this year, it\u2019s expected to be exhausted by 2024, according to midrange assumptions. If conditions worsen, the trust fund will run out by 2016.This is better than the 2009 projections, where trustees expected funds to dry up by 2017, according to midrange assumptions. That\u2019s the same date that Cain used.Still, as bad as the news is about the hospital insurance fund, FactCheck.org decided it didn\u2019t truly signal bankruptcy. The fund is only a portion of Medicare. The remainder is solvent for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s also worth noting that Congress has always pulled the hospital insurance fund from the brink of insolvency. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry.Now, let\u2019s deal with Cain\u2019s claim that Social Security will \"bottom out\" by 2037. There are two Social Security trust funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, which pays for benefits to retired workers, their families and to families of deceased workers; and Disability Insurance, which pays for benefits to disabled workers and their families.In 2009, midrange projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees said these trust funds combined will be exhausted in 2037, while the Disability Insurance fund will be gone by 2020. The outlook worsened this year. The Disability Insurance fund will be exhausted in 2018. Combined, their assets will be exhausted by 2036.When those funds run dry, Social Security will struggle to pay out benefits as promised, according to trustees. Cain\u2019s information was based on a 2009 op-ed. He got that year\u2019s data correct, and projections have not changed dramatically since then.But while it\u2019s fair for him to say that Social Security will \"bottom out\" by 2037, saying Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017 is a bit extreme. Only one of Medicare\u2019s funds is expected to be exhausted by that date, and Congress has never let it run dry. Lawmakers have bailed out the fund without fail for 40 years.Since Cain\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the Medicare trust fund, it meets our definition of Half True.",

        "doc": "\"Not only did Trump give the worst speech ever at CPAC, but he was also booed while talking, this will never get old,\" says a March 5, 2023 tweet sharing a video viewed more than 47,000 times. In the 20-second snippet taken from TikTok, Trump condemns \"perverts who use the names of Washington and Lincoln to buy millions of dollars in ads to say bad, libelous and incorrect things about us.\" The crowd boos in the background. The former president spoke for one hour and 45 minutes on March 4 to close out the four-day gathering of conservatives, rehashing voter fraud conspiracy theories as he made his case for another term in the White House in 2024. But despite what the posts suggest, Trump was not met with jeers in National Harbor, Maryland. A complete recording from C-SPAN shows a zoomed-out picture of the crowd as people start booing more than 20 minutes into Trump's speech. The footage indicates the target of their ire was a demonstrator whom security ushered out of the venue after disrupting the remarks. A Trump campaign aide confirmed to AFP that the booing was aimed at a protester. \"The booing was clearly not directed at President Trump,\" the aide, who attended the speech, said in an email. \"A little into the speech there was a disturbance with someone bringing in loud music. People booed that person and then began chanting 'USA' in support of President Trump. It was over very quickly.\" An AFP journalist at the event also did not hear the crowd boo Trump. Others present at the convention shared videos of the protester on Twitter. Several indicated the individual was playing \"FDT,\" an anti-Trump anthem that American rappers YG and the late Nipsey Hussle released in 2016. Using keywords for the event and the song, AFP found Instagram posts from a self-described pop-up DJ in New York City in which he claimed responsibility for crashing Trump's speech. Naveh Halperin, known as \"Subway DJ,\" confirmed to AFP in an Instagram direct message that he was the protester whom the crowd booed. Halperin's videos -- one of which shows him rolling his signature stereo on wheels into the venue before being escorted out by security -- back that up. \"I just interrupted trump's CPAC speech with some @nipseyhussle - 'F*** Donald Trump' chorus on repeat,\" he said in a March 4 Instagram post. \"Needless to say the MAGA were not happy about it.\" Another video post published days later says: \"Gave trump and his supporters a little surprise \"f*** donald trump\" interruption courtesy of @yg and @nipseyhussle. Was chased away by security before the verse could start but at least his supporters had fun.\" Halperin's activities in New York City have been the subject of several reports from local and national news outlets. AFP contacted CPAC for comment, but no response was forthcoming. AFP has fact-checked other claims about Trump here.",

Age of consent is decided on a state-by-state basis in the U.S. and ranges from 16 to 18 years old, and we found no evidence of any serious, concerted, or widespread effort in any state to modify the age of consent to encompass mere toddlers. Some commenters attempted to associate with claim with California\u2019s recently passed and controversial SB 145, but while that law allows certain individuals convicted of sex offenses involving minors to apply for discretionary relief from having to register as sex offenders, it does not in any way affect the age of consent in that state. The \u201cSaveOurChildren\u201d hashtag used in the example reproduced above was originally created to raise awareness of child sex trafficking, but it has since been \u201cco-opted by followers of QAnon, a sprawling conspiracy theory that pushes the idea that the Trump administration will take down an alleged global ring of pedophiles led by prominent Democrats.\u201d",

The same goes with me and any Marcos who are running for elective positions this 2022 election. We do not need to attend any interview, debate, or public meeting to win any election in any given time. The MARCOS name is already enough to make us win.\u201d It also bore the logos of United States-based media organizations NBC, CNN, NPR, Fox News, CBS News, and ABC, as well as the United Kingdom\u2019s BBC. Marcos never made the statement. No media outlet published or aired such a remark and attributed it to him. On the lower right corner of the satiric quote card was the text \u201cSatire only.\u201d However, several Facebook (FB) pages, groups, and netizens have shared the graphic taking it as truth, and criticized Sandro for being \u201carrogant\u201d and a \u201cliar.\u201d Some copies of the image have also circulated but with the \u201cSatire\u201d disclaimer cropped. The fabricated quote card manipulated one that was actually published by News5 on FB last Sept. 14, when Marcos announced he was gunning for the congressional seat of Ilocos Norte\u2019s first district. On Feb. 6, the media organization issued an advisory about the bogus claim and encouraged netizens to be more \u201ccritical\u201d in consuming information on social media. The altered graphic spread after the young Marcos\u2019 father Bongbong declined to participate in the Feb. 4 presidential forum organized by the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas, citing a scheduling conflict. It is not the first time the older Marcos refused an interview ahead of the May polls. He previously skipped a one-on-one interview with journalist Jessica Soho, claiming she was \u201cbiased.\u201d The revised quote card was published by several netizens and garnered more than 1,998 reactions, 912 comments, and 624 shares. It was also published and shared by at least 50 other FB groups and pages and has garnered more than 3,700 interactions collectively according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.

        "claim": "Poll results from the past 35 years show that State of the Union speeches \"do not move\" presidential approval numbers.",
        "doc": "CORRECTION: The initial version of this item erroneously attributed the comment to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. With President Barack Obama about to give the State of the Union address, pundits of all stripes have been pre-analyzing and prognosticating what he may say before a joint session of Congress on Jan. 25, 2011.On the Jan. 23, 2011, edition of ABC\u2019s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, former Republican strategist Matthew Dowd offered some historical context to how State of the Union speeches actually change public opinion -- or rather, how they do not.\"To me, the State of the Union (addresses) \u2026 they don't affect the American public,\" Dowd said during the program\u2019s roundtable segment. \"If you look at \u2026 approval numbers going into State of the Unions over the last 35 years and coming out, they do not move the numbers. Even Ronald Reagan, who was lauded as one of the best communicators in the history of this country, never moved the American public.\"We thought we\u2019d see whether Dowd was correct.While a number of media-affiliated polling organizations track presidential approval ratings, we turned to Gallup because polling experts frequently used the company\u2019s polls for long-term studies. Gallup, which began polling before World War II, has the longest and most consistent track record of publishing such polls.Mark Blumenthal, a polling analyst who founded the website Pollster.com, published a thorough analysis of the topic in 2006. It was augmented in a 2010 study by Gallup\u2019s own Jeffrey M. Jones.The Gallup data goes back to 1978 -- to President Jimmy Carter\u2019s first State of the Union address -- and includes a total of 28 addresses. (Most presidents have given an address to a joint session of Congress shortly after their first inauguration, but technically these are not State of the Union addresses. Because of that, neither Blumenthal nor Jones included them in their surveys, and we won\u2019t either.)Here\u2019s the bottom line as Jones puts it: \"A review of Gallup historical data suggests these speeches rarely affect a president's public standing in a meaningful way, despite the amount of attention they receive.\"By our count, presidents are actually somewhat more likely to see their polling numbers decline than see them rise after they give a State of the Union address. In all, the numbers rose 10 times, fell 15 times and remained unchanged three times. (You can see the year-by-year figures here.) Even more strikingly, the shifts were usually quite small. If you were to define a presidential \"bounce\" as a 5-point rise or more -- a bit outside the typical margin of error of 3 points -- then there have only been three \"bounces,\" or about once in every 10 speeches.In fact, during the period studied, a president\u2019s standing rose by more than 6 percentage points only once -- the 10-point rise for Bill Clinton in 1998. And that speech was somewhat exceptional, since the Monica Lewinsky scandal had just broken and Clinton used the address to refocus Americans (with some success) on his policy agenda.Clinton was the only one of the five presidents prior to Obama whose numbers rose when the poll numbers after each president's addresses were averaged together. Clinton saw his approval ratings rise by 3 points on average, while Carter and President Ronald Reagan saw their ratings drop by 1 point, President George H.W. Bush saw his ratings drop by 4 points and President George W. Bush saw his drop by 1 point.We should note that there is another type of poll taken during State of the Union season, usually with strikingly different results -- so-called \"instant polls.\" When Gallup does these polls, they ask people who responded to a pre-State of the Union poll if they minded getting a quick call after the speech to gauge their immediate reaction. Typically, these polls show favorable results toward whoever the president is.However, Blumenthal discounts the value of these polls, citing data showing that, in most cases, viewership for the State of the Union tilts heavily toward the president\u2019s party. \"Simply put, people who don't like a particular president are considerably less apt to tune him in,\" he quotes ABC polling director Gary Langer as saying.Since Blumenthal\u2019s published analysis is now five years old, we checked with him to see whether he still felt the same way. \"I definitely think the argument still holds,\" he told us.Dowd was very close to correct that State of the Union addresses \"do not move the numbers.\" Over the past 33 years at least, that has been the case more often than not. And the one president Dowd specifically cited, Reagan, never got a bump greater than 3 points. But there are a few exceptions, including Clinton's 10-point bounce in 1998. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",

Below is a screenshot comparison of the video shared in misleading posts (L) and YouTube video (R): Several other major media outlets reported on the police protest in September 2020, including Indian news agency ANI and the Times of India. Both reports stated that demonstrating officers were police in Ranchi, Jharkhand's capital. Delhi police also denied the claim about the old footage, stating on Twitter that that claim is a \u201cmischievous social media campaign\u201d that is \u201cpropagating false rumours regarding disaffection in police ranks.\u201d \u201cOld, unrelated videos were being posted with fake news of resignation of police personnel,\u201d reads another tweet in the police\u2019s thread published on February 1, 2021.

        "doc": "President Donald Trump has received plenty of criticism for the timeline of his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Now a Facebook post making the rounds seeks to scrutinize Trump\u2019s actions in comparison to health officials\u2019 warnings about the virus. The post says that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning about COVID-19 as early as Jan. 8, but that Trump continued to hold campaign rallies and play golf before he \"admitted the coronavirus might be a problem\" on March 13. The post lists specific dates, saying \"Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9, Jan 14, Jan 28, Jan 30, Feb 10, Feb 19, Feb 20, Feb 21, & Feb 28. He golfed on Jan 18, Jan 19, Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 7, Mar 8.\" This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked into the claim date by date and found that Trump did hold rallies and go golfing on those dates. But the CDC\u2019s warning said the threat of the coronavirus to Americans was low, and Trump took action against the virus earlier than March 13. According to online archives of the events page on Trump\u2019s website, rallies were held across the U.S. on the dates listed in the post, including the Feb. 28 rally in North Charleston, S.C., where he used the word \"hoax\" while talking about the coronavirus. Trump also went golfing on the dates mentioned in the post. Social media posts and press reports in Palm Beach document visits the president made to his Florida golf course in the first three months of 2020. The dates when the CDC first warned the public about COVID-19 and when Trump \"admitted the coronavirus might be a problem\" are more ambiguous. On Jan. 8, the CDC announced in a health advisory that it was investigating a new coronavirus detected in Wuhan, China. The advisory stated that \"no human-to-human transmission has been reported.\" As a precaution, it advised health officials to wear an \"N95 disposable facepiece respirator\" if they were treating a patient who had recently traveled to Wuhan and was experiencing respiratory problems. The situation summary the CDC posted on Jan. 10 stressed that there were no deaths associated with the novel coronavirus at the time and that the health risk to the American public was low. On Feb. 1, the CDC updated its advisory and noted that there were seven cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. It detailed how doctors and caregivers should avoid being in close contact with patients who might have COVID-19, especially those who had traveled to China or had been in close contact with known cases. The Feb. 28 update from the CDC told doctors to assume that anyone with respiratory symptoms had COVID-19, even if they hadn\u2019t had close contact with other patients or traveled to China recently. It\u2019s hard to put a finger on when Trump \"admitted the coronavirus might be a problem.\" RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic On Feb. 27, Trump announced during a press conference that he was putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force. However, in the same conference, Trump told reporters that he didn\u2019t think a widespread outbreak in the U.S. was inevitable, just that \"there\u2019s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse.\" Trump gave an Oval Office address on March 11, the same day the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic, in which he banned travel from Europe for the next 30 days. He also reminded the public that on March 6 he had signed, and Congress had passed, \"an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies.\" Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 during a press conference with his Coronavirus Task Force. This opened up $50 billion of funding that would be used to \"fight against this disease.\" Our ruling A recent Facebook post claimed that Trump was warned about COVID-19 on Jan. 8 but continued to hold campaign rallies and play golf until he \"admitted the coronavirus might be a problem\" on March 13. While the golf and rally dates are accurate, the dates of the CDC\u2019s first warning and Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus aren\u2019t as clear cut. There was a health advisory issued Jan. 8, though the threat to the U.S. was undefined and person-to-person transmission wasn\u2019t established yet. It\u2019s harder to determine the date on which Trump admitted there was a problem, but he did take specific actions before March 13. Those actions included creating a task force, signing a bill for health research funding and banning travel from China and Europe. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context.

        "doc": "A winner of the presidential election wasn\u2019t declared on Nov. 3, because several states that looked favorable for President Donald Trump \"decided to stop counting\" votes \u2014 that\u2019s what Facebook users are contending. A Nov. 4 post includes screenshots of purported election results in five battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Michigan is listed twice. \"Good morning! And welcome to the BS we all knew was coming,\" the caption says. \"Trump is headed for a win, so six states just DECIDED TO STOP COUNTING in the wee hours for the first time in an election.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found dozens of similar claims using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. (Screenshot from Facebook) As of 2:25 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, the Associated Press had called only Wisconsin in favor of Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger. None of the other states listed in the Facebook post had been decided. We reached out to the original poster for evidence to support their claim, but we didn\u2019t hear back. So we decided to take a closer look at whether the states cited in the Facebook post did stop counting ballots overnight on Nov. 3. The short answer is: They didn\u2019t. Election officials in Fulton County, Ga., briefly paused counting ballots after a pipe burst at a facility in Atlanta. North Carolina stopped counting in-person votes once 100% of precincts were reported. But none of the states stopped counting votes altogether \u2014and there\u2019s no evidence they tried to swing the results in favor of Biden. In three states cited in the Facebook post \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 election officials were not allowed to start tabulating mail-in ballots until Election Day or just before. That resulted in reporting delays overnight on Nov. 3, since mail ballots take more time to count than in-person votes. \"At no point has the counting process stopped since it began at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, which was when, per Michigan election law, it could begin,\" said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, referring to the morning of Nov. 3. We reached out to election officials in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but we haven\u2019t heard back. Archived election results pages for both states show that they continued to count ballots overnight on Nov. 3. The Trump campaign announced Nov. 4 that it was filing a lawsuit to halt the counting of votes in Michigan until it's granted \"meaningfulaccess\" to observe the tabulation process. Election officials in Philadelphia County, a reliably Democratic part of Pennsylvania, told reporters Nov. 4 that they had counted about 141,000 mail-in ballots overnight, and that they still had more than 200,000 to go. As of 2:45 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, about 92% of precincts had reported their in-person votes, and about 41% of mail ballots were outstanding. Wisconsin officials saidon the morning of Nov. 4 that they had counted all the ballots, and the AP called the statefor Biden at 2:16 p.m. EST. The situation in the South is a bit different. Georgia allowed election officials to count mail-in ballots before Election Day, but the state faced delays nonetheless. In Fulton County, the state\u2019s most populous county and home of Atlanta, absentee ballot counting was delayed by four hours after a burst water pipe caused flooding in State Farm Arena, where ballots were being processed. None of the ballots were damaged, but the incident put Fulton \u2014a Democratic stronghold \u2014behind in the vote-counting process. (As of 2:45 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, Fulton County was still counting ballots.) \"A small team of Fulton County Registration & Election workers continued to process absentee ballots overnight last night and a larger team began work at 8:30 a.m.,\" said Jessica Corbitt, director of external affairs for Fulton County. \"Last night, 74,000 absentee ballots were tabulated (and) included in results. There are approximately 42,400 (ballots that) will be opened, scanned and adjudicated today \u2026 Work will continue until completed.\" The only state that stopped counting votes overnight on Nov. 3 was North Carolina \u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s done counting votes, and the halt had nothing to do with Trump being ahead in the state. RELATED:Trump falsely and prematurely claims 2020 presidential victory \"North Carolina stopped counting votes on election night because there were no more votes to count at that time,\" said Patrick Gannon, public information director for the state Board of Elections. In North Carolina, 100% of precincts have reported in-person votes, and the results show that Trump has a slight edge over Biden. But Gannon said county boards of election across the state will now begin counting provisional and absentee ballots that arrive by Nov. 12, as long as they\u2019re postmarked by Election Day. \"Regardless of vote differentials, we never stop counting until all eligible votes are counted and added to the final results,\" he said. \"The person who you are fact-checking clearly doesn\u2019t understand how elections work.\" The delay in results does not indicate that anything is wrong \u2014rather, it highlights the difficulty of holding an election during the coronavirus pandemic. \"Election results reporting may occur more slowly than prior years,\" says the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency on a \"rumor control\" page. \"This does not indicate there is any problem with the counting process or results. Official results are not certified until all validly cast ballots have been counted, including ballots that are counted after election night.\" The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Regardless, she can\u2019t continue to use the crawl space as a den, and the cubs are too young to be moved around in the cold.\u201d But the agency was quickly proven wrong. In a post shared to Facebook on Feb. 17, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency said that the mother had returned to the crawl space, and the owner of the house was going to allow her to continue living there. After the cubs spent two days being hand-reared and bottle-fed by rescuers, wildlife officials placed them in a box with a portable heating pad and blanket back in the crawl space. In the video, the mother can be seen tending to her cubs, with her snout poking out of the crawl space as one of her cubs cried out. \u201cCubs in the wild are generally quiet; they don\u2019t want to attract attention. However, when they\u2019re hungry, frightened, or cold, they SCREAM. They want to attract their mother. It works,\u201d wrote ABR. Black bears are native to Tennessee and much of North America. Reaching heights of up to 6 feet tall when standing on their hind legs, their body weight fluctuates between 125 and 600 pounds, depending on the season. And when it is denning season, females will den with their cubs in a number of places, including under boulders, tree roots, fallen trees \u2014 and, yes, under houses. Females will typically hibernate as early as November and stay in their den until as late as May, with their cubs typically born in January or February. Cubs themselves are born blind and without fur and weigh in at just a few ounces. By the time they emerge in spring, each individual can grow to up to 5 pounds. Young and vulnerable, cubs will stay with their mom for the first year or so of their lives before venturing out to establish their own territory. According to BearWise, one of the responding groups under the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, one of the leading factors in human-bear contact is food. It is not clear how the bear came to find the crawl space, but black bears are known to be attracted to human food sources, including garbage. Because black bears are rarely aggressive toward people, the owner of the home told authorities he would allow the bear to continue denning in his crawl space until the end of her hibernation period. (Black bears do not defecate, urinate, or eat during their hibernation.) To limit humans\u2019 risk of coming into contact with a black bear, experts recommend keeping food and garbage locked away and inaccessible to curious bears. But if you come into contact with a black bear, experts advise making your presence known by yelling at the bear and slowly backing away without turning your back. And in the event of an attack, fight back.",

        "doc": "By their very nature, State of the Nation addresses are tricky to fact-check. They are written by committees, the product of many hands and input from many government departments and agencies. The facts and figures that make the final cut are carefully selected and often stripped of nuance and context to present the most positive picture possible. This was President Jacob Zuma's sixth State of the Nation address and the last of his current term. You can read his full speech here . Being an election year, Zuma's speech borrowed heavily from the African National Congress manifesto and reflected on the ANC's claimed achievements over the past five years and twenty years. Viewed in isolation, many of the numbers he presented stand up. But they often lack context. We have endeavoured, as best we can, to evaluate Zuma's claims within a broader context. This is a look at some of the key claims that were made. Claim \"We have created 3.7 million work opportunities over the past five years.\" Verdict unproven The 2012/13 annual report of the Department of Public Works states that 3,054,027 \"work opportunities\" were created between April 2009 and March 2013. Zuma's claim can only be properly assessed when the figures for 2013/14 are released later this year. It is important to note that a \"work opportunity\" is not a permanent job. South Africa's department of public works defines a work opportunity as \"paid work created for an individual for any period of time \" as part of South Africa's expanded public works programme. Many \"work opportunities\" last only a few months. For instance , a \"work opportunity\" lasts an average of four months in the \"infrastructure sector\" and six months in the \"environment and culture\" sector. Ideally, these opportunities are meant to equip people with skills that can help them seek formal employment. It should be noted that even if 3.7-million \"work opportunities\" were created it does not mean that 3.7-million people gained work. If someone is hired for one project and then moves on to another and another, each period of employment is counted as a single \"work opportunity\". Claim \"The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61 percent in 2009 to 78 percent last year and the bachelor passes improve each year.\" Verdict misleading In 2009 the matric pass rate was 60.6%. It increased to 78.2% in 2013 . However, South Africa's high dropout rate means that many young people will never get the chance to write their matric examinations, let alone pass them. When the matric class of 2013 started grade two in 2003 there were 1,111,858 students. But by the time they came to sit for their final exams their numbers had fallen to 562,112. (Read our report on why the matric pass rate is not a reliable benchmark of education quality ) With regard to the second part of Zuma's claim, bachelor passes have not improved consistently each year since 2009. According to the education department, the number of bachelor passes increased from 109,697 in 2009 to 126,371 in 2010. But in 2011 the number of bachelor passes dipped to 120,767, before increasing to 136,047 in 2012 and 171,755 in 2013 . Claim \"The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300 thousand to more than 700 thousand between 2003 and 2011.\" Verdict correct In 2003 there were 315,387 students enrolled in Grade R, according to the basic education department. By 2011, enrolment had increased to 734,654. In 2013 , it had increased to 779,370. These figures include both public and independent schools. Claim \"Student enrolments at universities increased by 12% while further Education and Training college enrolments have increased by 90%.\" Verdict correct Zuma did not give dates for the increases but his claim appears to be supported by the Department of Higher Education and Training's 2012/13 annual report. It states that student enrolment at universities increased by 12% from 837,779 in 2009 to 938,201 in 2012/13. However, demand for university education far outweighs the number of places available. In 2013, the University of the Witwatersrand received over 35,000 applications for approximately 5,500 first year places Further Education and Training College enrolments increased from 345,566 in 2010 to 657,690 in 2012/13. Claim \"When 95% of households have access to water, the 5% who still need to be provided for, feel they cannot wait a moment longer. Success is also the breeding ground of rising expectations.\" Verdict unproven An odd statement. Without \"access to water\" people die. It follows that all South Africans therefore have some or other \"access to water\", be it piped, bottled, from water tankers, rain water tanks, streams or dams. What exactly Zuma means by the phrase is unclear, as is the source of the claim. We examined a number of similar claims in a report published last year . South Africa's water and environmental affairs minister, Edna Molewa, has previously claimed that 94.7% of South Africans have access to \"clean and safe drinking water\". Her spokesman, Mava Scott, claimed last year that 96.4% of all households had access to \"piped water\". The 2011 national census put the figure of households with \"access to piped water\" at 91.2%. The most recent general household survey , published last year by Statistics South Africa, states that 90.8% of households had \"access to piped water\" in 2012. The figures differ from province to province. In the Eastern Cape, for instance, only 79% of households  were found to have access to piped water. When we spoke to him last year, Scott explained that \"[w]hen we talk about piped water, we are normally referring to infrastructure and people have access to water coming out of that infrastructure\" . As recent violent water protests in South Africa's North West province have shown, having a tap in your yard, home or street, doesn't mean you have water or that the water is \"clean and safe\". Nationally there has been growing dissatisfaction over the quality of water. According to the general household survey , in 2012, \"60,1% of households rated the quality of water-related services they received as 'good'\". \"Satisfaction has, however, been eroding steadily since 2005 when 76,4% of users rated the services as good. Residents of Free State, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape have consistently been least satisfied with the quality of water. In 2012, 15,1% of households in Free State felt that their water smelled bad compared to 11,7% of Mpumalanga households and only 2,4% of Gauteng households. Free State households were most likely to feel that their water was unsafe to drink (15,1%), not clear (16,5%) and not tasting well (15,2%).\" Zuma's suggestion that recent violent service delivery protests can be attributed to the \"rising expectations\" of the \"5% who still need to be provided for\", has been characterised as \"spin-doctoring\" by a number of political commentators and opposition parties. We have been unable to find any reliable research that supports his contention. Claim \"Parliament is finalising amendments to the law to give effect to this very positive development, which will cut to under 300 days, the time it takes to start a mine, from application to final approvals.\" Verdict correct A typed copy of Zuma's speech that was circulated by Zuma's office quotes him referring to \"under 300 days\" as the time it will take to start a mine. But, while delivering his speech in parliament, Zuma referred to \"under 30 days\" . (Watch from 2:22:00) Zuma  appears to have misread the speech. His spokesman, Mac Maharaj, told Africa Check the correct figure is 300 days. Claim \"The tourism industry has grown dramatically. In 1993, South Africa received a mere 3 million foreign visitors. By 2012, the figure had grown to 13 million visitors.\" Verdict exaggerated Statistics South Africa indicates slightly more than 3-million foreign travellers came to South Africa in 1993. In earlier presentations , President Zuma has referred to a figure of 3,4-million foreign visitors for that year. The latest tourism report from StatsSA confirms that during 2012 \"about 13,8 million foreigners arrived in South Africa\". Not all of these, however, are considered tourists. StatsSA states 94,7% of foreign arrivals in 2012 were \"visitors\" of which 29,7% were \"same day visitors\" and 70,3% \u2013 or 9,2-million people \u2013 were overnight visitors or \"tourists\". The balance were classed as business travellers, students and workers. StatsSA defines \"tourist\" as an overnight visitor, and tourism as \"the activities of persons travelling to, and staying in places outside their usual environment, for not more than one consecutive year, for leisure, business and other purposes.\" SADC countries are the single biggest source of foreign visitors to South Africa, accounting for more than 70% of all tourists. This figure/proportion is consistent with previous decades \u2013 the 1996 White Paper on Tourism indicates 73% of all international arrivals in 1995 were from African countries. Aurelia Segatti, a researcher at the African Centre for Migration & Society explains that, as most SADC nationals, and citizens of many other countries, may enter the country for up to 90 days on a tourist visa, a \"tourist\" stamp does not necessarily give us an indication of individual motives for entering South Africa \u2013 and that many of these reasons may fall outside the sightseeing and curio-buying  associated with \"tourism\". Segatti says that, although it is not possible to do a qualitative breakdown of exactly how many foreign visitors come to South Africa for exactly which reasons, many are involved in trade,  \"coming to Johannesburg and shopping in malls, and getting goods back to [their] place of origin\". Many of these traders travel with their relatives. There are people who also come to visit friends and family in South Africa. Some travel for  medical reasons in order to seek private healthcare or to access public healthcare facilities. People also \"visit\" South Africa in an attempt to illegally enter the South African labour market. Claim \"The overall crime rate has decreased by 21 percent since 2002\u2026\" Verdict misleading The decrease in the overall crime rate claimed by Zuma refers only to the period  2002/2003 to 2011/2012. It excludes the most recent 2012/2013 crime statistics which have shown worrying increases in a number of categories of serious and violent crime. On the face of it, Zuma's claim appears to be supported by a 2012 fact sheet prepared by South Africa's Institute for Security Studies which stated that \"[s]ince the 2002/03 financial year, when total crime levels peaked in South Africa, the overall crime rate has decreased by 21%\". But the fact-sheet also pointedly cautioned that overall crime rates do not give us useful information in terms of increases or decreases in specific crime categories, with respect to regional crime rate changes, or the reasons for the change in crime rates. Without this context, the victory-against-crime claim recycled in the president's State of the Nation address becomes almost meaningless. Zuma's claim deliberately selects 2002 \u2013 a period when \"total crime levels peaked in South Africa\" \u2013 as its benchmark. While overall crime rates may have decreased by 21% between 2002 and 2012, the ISS noted that \"overall levels of crime [for 2011/2012] are actually quite compar[a]ble with the levels recorded in 1994/1995\". The decline in crime has also not been uninterrupted. According to the ISS, a \"3% increase in total crime levels was recorded in the two-year period between 2007/08 and 2009/10\", which was followed by marginal decreases in the subsequent two years. Gareth Newham, head of the Institute's governance, crime and justice division says that crime levels have seen an overall increase in the last two years, driven by increases in property crime and, more recently, serious violent crimes. In Newham's view, Zuma's annual address should have focused on \"what has happened in the last year, not distracting us by discussing the last ten years. \"In the last year all forms of serious and violent crimes \u2013 including murder, attempted murder, house robbery, street robbery \u2013 all of these have increased. Murder is of particular concern, because the [murder rate] had been coming down \u2013 and this is the first time murder has increased in seven years.\" Claim \"On average, the economy has grown at 3,2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.\" Verdict mostly-correct According to the World Bank \"GDP growth in South Africa has averaged 3.2% a year since 1995 \". This is confirmed by Africa's Check's own calculations based on real GDP tables. While Zuma's numbers were correct, the context was noticeably lacking. Economic growth \u2013 evaluated in terms of real GDP \u2013 has slowed in recent years. In 2012, South Africa's GDP growth fell to 2.5%. The World Bank estimated GDP growth at just 1.9% for 2013,  the lowest since the 2009 recession. It is expected to increase to a projected 2.7% for 2014. Rian le Roux, chief economist at Old Mutual, says that since 1994 the economy has seen \"periods of bad growth and times when the economy did quite well\", the latter boosted by global commercial booms, and local infrastructure and credit booms. \"The question is what is the growth potential at the moment and that's probably less than 3%.\" This figure, le Roux says, means there will be insufficient growth to address the backlog of unemployment or drive the creation of new jobs, and means that even where jobs are created they may not be sustainable. This view is supported by a recent statement from the International Monetary Fund , which praises South Africa's strong macroeconomic policies but points out that the country's economic performance has been slower and lower than other emerging markets \u2013 and that the current growth rate \"creates jobs, but not enough for the growing labor [sic] force and those currently without work\". Le Roux says that to \"overcome the backlog of 20 years of isolation we need to have fast economic growth\". \"There are 500,000 new matriculants who can't find jobs. The youth subsidy will not make much of a dent. We have got to raise the growth rate and increase the labour absorption capacity of the private sector.\" Addressing issues like low business confidence and problematic labour relations will, le Roux says, create more favourable business conditions and \"make people want to invest in South Africa.\" Claim \"Jobs are now being created again.There are now 15 million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650 thousand jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.\" Verdict misleading According to latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey published by StatsSA, 15,177,000 people were employed in the last quarter of 2013 and 653,000 jobs were created in the last year. What Zuma failed to acknowledge is that the unemployment rate in South Africa is higher today than it was before the recession. Prior to the recession South Africa's unemployment rate was 21.9%. According to StatsSA, 4,830,000 South Africans are classified as unemployed , resulting in an unemployment rate of 24.1%. But StatsSA uses a very narrow definition of \"unemployment\" which refers only people who are unemployed but actively seeking work. An \"expanded rate\" of unemployment - which includes people who do not have a job and are available to work but have not taken active steps to look for work - suggests that unemployment levels were as high as 34% in the fourth quarter of last year . Claim \"Mother to child transmission of HIV has declined sharply.\" Verdict correct A recent study published by the World Health Organisation showed that mother-to-child transmission of HIV in South Africa dropped from 8,5% in 2008 to 3,5% in 2010 and 2,7% in 2011. Claim \"[W]e have doubled the number of people who are receiving anti-retroviral treatment, from one million to 2.4 million people in 2013.\" Verdict misleading This could be read to mean that during 2013 the number of people on anti-retroviral treatment doubled from 1-million to 2.4-million. That is not the case. StatsSA estimated that there were 1,058,399 adults and 105,123 children receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2010. Using data from the Department of Health, the 2012/13 District Health Barometer , estimated that  2,161,170 adults were on anti-retroviral treatment by the end of 2012/13. But, as the Barometer pointed out, the number of adults on anti-retroviral treatment could be overestimated if patients are not excluded from counts when, for example, they die or fail to adhere to the programme. Other concerns about the counts have also been raised .The fact that people are receiving anti-retroviral treatment does not mean they are currently taking it or will continue to take it. It's also not clear how tests are counted. Are people who get tested multiple times counted once per test or only once? We have asked the department for clarity and will update the report if they respond. In response to some of the criticisms, South Africa's health minister,  Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, has argued that South Africa's increasing life expectancy suggests that people are adhering to their treatment. Claim \"More than 20 million South Africans have taken the HIV test since the launch of the campaign in 2011 which indicates confidence in the health system.\" Verdict mostly-correct South Africa's HIV counselling and testing campaign was launched in April 2010, not 2011. According the country's health department, the available data suggests that 9.7-million people had been tested by the end of 2010/11 . In 2011/2012 the department claims that 8.7-million people were tested. In 2012/13 , it says close to 9-million people were tested for HIV. The department's 2013/14 annual report will only be released later this year, but calculations based on figures in previous annual reports indicate that  around 27-million people have been tested since the launch of the campaign in 2010, well above Zuma's claim. But there appear to be serious discrepancies in the department's figures. The 2012/13 annual report states that 20-million people were tested in 2010/11. However, this is contradicted by the 2010/11 annual report which states that 9.7-million people were tested in that year. It should also be noted that while the programme reported testing almost 9-million people in 2012/13, the department failed to meet its target of 18-million tests. Claim \"In housing, about 3 million housing units and more than 855 thousand serviced sites were delivered since 1994.\" Verdict mostly-correct The Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation's latest development indicators show that about 3.3-million housing units have either been completed or are \"in progress\". According to Xolani Xundu, a spokesman in the Department of Human Settlements, 2,799,702 \"houses and units\" were delivered from 1994 to December 2013. He says the number of \"serviced sites\" delivered over that period came to 876,774. A 2013 report by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) pointed out that housing figures from different government sources are often contradictory. Claim \"Nearly 500 informal settlements have been replaced with quality housing and basic services over the past five years.\" Verdict unproven According to the Department of Human Settlements the figure is correct, but the data does not exist in a single collated form, and should refer only to basic services as it does not necessarily include housing. The department's Victor Rajkumar told Africa Check there were  \"myriad source documents\" from which the department gathered its information. While no \"list\" exists showing that 500 informal settlements have been upgraded, Rajkumar says data from various sources indicates \"at least 500 interventions or upgrading interventions\" in informal settlements. Defining the extent and status of informal settlements in South Africa remains a contentious issue. The current baseline used to measure the number of informal settlements in South Africa comes from 2009. It states that there are approximately 2,700 informal settlements across the country, and that households in these settlements continue to grow at around 3% per annum.  (According to the human settlements department, this figure will be updated during the course of 2014) A recent report from the Housing Development Agency suggests that the number of households living in informal settlements has stabilised since 2001. In 2011 there were approximately 1,66-million households in informal residential areas or shacks not in a backyard. Kate Tissington from the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) told Africa Check that while government \"likes to talk about upgrading settlements\", the reality is that very little has been done. According to Tissington, \"delivery figures around informal settlement upgrading are often very ambiguous, sometimes referring to formal housing projects and often hiding the removal of people from settlements and the growth of households living in backyard shacks\". Claim \"Since 1994, nearly 5,000 farms, comprising 4.2 million hectares, have been transferred to black people, benefiting over 200,000 families.\" Verdict mostly-correct Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti told Parliament last year that  4,813 farms had been transferred to black people and communities between 1994 and 2013, benefiting 230,886 people. In 2012, a survey by the South African Institute of Race Relations found that 2,864 farms had been redistributed by August 2009. Between 2009 and 2012, 848 farms were acquired, giving a total of 3,712 farms by 2012. The survey found there were over 220,000 beneficiaries by March 2012. The accuracy of the official government figures have however been questioned. Dr Peter Jacobs, a research specialist in economic performance and development at the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), told Africa Check discrepancies exist between figures compiled by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, the National Treasury and \"various researchers\". South Africa's land reform programme has been dogged by controversy amid reports of farms failing and projects collapsing. A survey of land reform and restitution projects presented at a 2013 conference on agrarian reform organised by the HSRC, indicated that one third of 301 households surveyed were not actively using the land they had received. \"Within that third there are some [people] that have taken big loans, they are failing to pay back and in those cases the land has been taken back by the banks,\" said Dr Jacobs. In recent years senior government officials, including Nkwinti, have repeatedly stated that over 90 per cent of the land transferred through the land reform programme is not productive . Professor Ben Cousins, the founder of the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (Plaas) has argued that \"the actual failure rate is more like 50%, and a further 30% are struggling\". To address the challenge, government embarked on a recapitalisation and development programme . By March 2013, 1,351 farms were reported to have been recapitalised , at a cost of R2.14-billion. Jacobs believes that land reform and redistribution projects have thus far failed to bring about transformation and have created a rural elite that benefits more than the poor. According to Cousins \"there are some success stories, but a great many failures too\" for \"beneficiaries who have been told (or chosen) to enter into strategic partnerships with businesses\". Zuma's speech also made no mention of the fact that far less than 10% of the land earmarked for redistribution has been transferred. The initial target, set in 2009, was that 30% of the land that was historically in the hands of \"white commercial farmers\" would be redistributed by 2014. \"Government is not likely to transfer the remaining 20% of land within the next 20 to 30 years,\" Jacobs believes. Claim \"Nearly 80,000 land claims, totalling 3.4 million hectares, have been settled and 1.8 million people have benefited.\" Verdict mostly-correct A total of 67,531 land claims had been submitted by 1999. A backlog in processing saw this number grow to a total of 79,696 claims. By the end of 2012 nearly 96% of these claims had reportedly been settled. The  2012/2013 annual report of the Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights states:  \"A total of 77,334 claims have been settled to date. Of these, 71,292 claims were settled by payment of financial compensation of R6,561,021,691 to claimants.\" The annual report also indicates that a \"total of 111,278 people benefitted from the restitution programme in the 2012/13 financial year\". An earlier Progress Report on Land Restitution Claims delivered to the Portfolio Committee On Rural Development and Land Reform in February 2012 indicated that, between 1995 and January 2012, a total of 76,506 claims had been settled which impacted on 1,662,099 beneficiaries. When the 2012/13 figure of 111,278 is added to this, it results in a total of 1,773,377 individuals.",

It has been shared more than 8,000 times, including here to an Australia-based Facebook group with more than 45,000 members. The two-minute three-second footage shows a tall structure burning next to two flags and a building. Firefighters can be seen and a male voice can be heard reporting in Italian, saying he can see a telecommunications tower and a boat on fire. The Dutch-language caption claims that the video shows a 5G tower that was set on fire by Italians \u201cout of anger\u201d in La Spezia, a port city in northwest Italy, in April 2020. Also in April, the video was shared alongside similar claims in Italian, German and Polish. Some of those posts states the fire was linked to online claims that 5G has caused the novel coronavirus pandemic. However, the claims are misleading.

        "doc": "A screenshot of a tweet purportedly made by Supreme Court lawyer and BJP Uttar Pradesh spokesperson Prashant Patel Umrao is being shared on social media claiming that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is an anti-Hindu and a Crypto Christian. This post claims that Mother Teresa had converted Kejriwal to Christianity in 1992 and thereafter, Kejriwal had volunteered for Missionaries of Charity for 6 months. Also, this post claims Kejriwal as a member of an international syndicate against Hinduism. Let\u2019s verify the claims made in the post. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Claim: Mother Teresa converted Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal into Christianity and thereafter, he volunteered for Missionary of Charity for 6 months. Fact: This tweet is now not available on Prashant Patel Umrao\u2019s Twitter handle and we could not confirm if he made any such tweet. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal multiple times proclaimed himself as a devout Hindu and a Hanuman follower. While it is true that Arvind Kejriwal had worked with Mother Teresa and volunteered for Missionaries of Charity, there is no evidence to prove that Arvind Kejriwal had converted to Christianity as mentioned in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. On searching for this tweet on the Prashant Patel Umrao\u2019s Twitter handle, we could not find this tweet. However, we could not confirm if he made any such tweet. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in multiple interviews proclaimed himself as a \u2018devout Hindu\u2019 and a follower of Hanuman. During the 2020 town hall address with News 18 channel, Kejriwal identified himself as a devout Hindu when the anchor questioned his religion. Reporting this information, \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 published an article on 03 February 2020. When we searched to check whether Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had worked as a volunteer for Missionaries of Charity, it is found out that Kejriwal had volunteered for Missionaries of Charity. Arvind Kejriwal through a tweet confirmed that he had worked with Mother Teresa for few months at Nirmal Hriday Ashram in Kolkata. Arvind Kejriwal had described multiple interactions with Mother Teresa during the \u2018News 18\u2019 interview conducted in 2016. According to the \u2018News 18\u2019 article, Arvind Kejriwal joined Missionaries of Charity after he resigned from Tata Steel in Jamshedpur. In 2013, \u2018India TV\u2019 reported that Arvind Kejriwal while explaining his work experience with Mother Teresa had said, \u201cThere were lots of people in these villages who had started turning to Christianity. Somehow, I started feeling guilty. Is Hinduism doing sufficient things for its own people? What are we doing for them?\u201d. But he had never said that he converted to Christianity to serve Missionaries of Charity. Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi had visited multiple churches and Christian events in Delhi. In 2019, while addressing a Christian and New Year Celebration at the Delhi Assembly, Arvind Kejriwal said, \u201cOur government has completed five years and the satisfaction we have is that we have tried to run it on the path shown by Christ\u201d. Arvind Kejriwal made this statement to explain that his government is considering the diversity of the country and giving equal importance to all religions. Kejriwal had never identified himself as a crypto Christian. Also, there is no such organization called \u2018International Syndicate against Hinduism\u2019 for Arvind Kejriwal to be a part of it. To sum it up, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had not converted to Christianity for volunteering in Missionaries for Charity.",

The BJP government published an infographic on the 48-months portal that makes three claims about the banking sector. This article is a fact check of the claims. Has the \u2018Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)\u2019 led to significant results? The first claim is that \u2018historic insolvency and bankruptcy code implemented leading to significant results\u2019. The annual report (2016-17) of the Ministry of Finance states that, \u2018a Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee was set up in August 2014 for providing an entrepreneur friendly legal bankruptcy framework for India meeting global standards for improving the ease of doing business with necessary judicial capacity. The Committee submitted its Report and draft bill in November 2015. Based on this, as well as public/stakeholder consultation, a bill by name \u201cThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015\u201d was introduced in the Lok Sabha in December 2015. The Bill was referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament. The Joint Committee of Parliament submitted its report in April 2016. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was passed by Parliament on in May 2016 and published in the Official Gazette in May 2016.\u201d The annual report (2016-17) of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MoCA) states that \u2018following the notification of The Insolvency and Bankruptcy code, 2016 (IBC), Government of India (Allocation of Business) rules, 1961 were amended and notified in August 2016 wherein MoCA was entrusted with the responsibility to administer the Code. The Code has been framed with the object to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner\u2019. The report also describes that the IBC proposes a framework to ensure: Early detection of stress in a business Initiation of the insolvency resolution process by debtor, financial creditor or operational creditor Timely revival of viable businesses Liquidation of unviable businesses Minimization of losses to all stakeholders Avoiding destruction of value of failed business\u2019 The website of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India states that \u2018the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India was established in October, 2016 under the IBC. It is a key pillar of the ecosystem responsible for implementation of IBC that consolidates and amends the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner for maximization of the value of assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all the stakeholders. It is a unique regulator: regulates a profession as well as processes. It has regulatory oversight over the Insolvency Professionals, Insolvency Professional Agencies, Insolvency Professional Entities and Information Utilities. It writes and enforces rules for processes, namely, corporate insolvency resolution, corporate liquidation, individual insolvency resolution and individual bankruptcy under the IBC. It has recently been tasked to promote the development of, and regulate, the working and practices of, insolvency professionals, insolvency professional agencies and information utilities and other institutions, in furtherance of the purposes of the IBC\u2019. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states that \u2018the referring of cases under IBC to the NCLT, the recapitalization of public sector banks, and the announcement of the plan for further consolidation among the public sector banks boosted the sentiments in the market\u2019 As per latest data shared by the government in the Rajya Sabha in February 2019, a total of 1484 cases had been admitted for resolution under IBC as on 31st December 2018. Of these, 562 cases were filed by Financial Creditors (FCs), out of which 78 cases have been resolved till 31st December 2018 and an amount of Rs. 65,796 crores realized by FCs against admitted claim amount of Rs. 1,36,128 crores. Claim: Historic insolvency and bankruptcy code leading to significant results. Fact: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was passed by Parliament in May 2016 and was notified in the same month. In terms of the impact, it is still early days since a significant number of cases are pending. Hence the claim that the IBC was brought by the current government is TRUE while the impact remains UNVERIFIED. Have PSBs been infused with 2,11,000 crore rupees? The second claim is that \u2018recapitalization of PSBs by infusion of 2,11,000 crore rupees to support credit growth and job creation\u2019. A response in Lok Sabha from January 2018 states that \u2018Government announced Indra Dhanush plan for revamping Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in August 2015. The plan envisaged, infusion of capital in PSBs by the Government to the tune of Rs. 70,000 crores over a period of four financial years. Government has recently announced decision to further recapitalize PSBs to the tune of Rs. 2,11,000 crores, through recapitalization bonds of Rs. 1,35,000 crore and budgetary provision of Rs. 18,139 crores (the residual amount under Indra Dhanush plan) over two financial years, and the balance through capital raising by banks from the market. Government has so far infused capital of Rs. 59,435 crores in PSBs. Capital infusion is aimed at supplementing the achievement of regulatory capital norms by PSBs through their own efforts and, in addition, based on performance and potential, augmenting their growth capital. Government has announced that a differentiated approach would be followed, based on the strength of each bank\u2019. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance also states that \u2018the Government thus announced its decision in October 2017 to recapitalize PSBs to essentially supplement the latter\u2019s own efforts to adhere to the regulatory capital adequacy norms and to also enable increased credit offtake and catalyze faster economic growth. The announced recapitalization entails mobilization of capital, with maximum allocation in the current year, to the tune of Rs. 2,11,000 crores over the next two years, through budgetary provisions of Rs. 18,139 crores recapitalization bonds to the tune of Rs. 1,35,000 crores, and the balance through capital raising by banks from the market\u2019. Claim: Recapitalization of PSBs by infusion of 2,11,000 crore rupees to support credit growth and job creation. Fact: The recapitalization of PSBs is planned by infusing Rs. 2,11,000 crores through budgetary provision, recapitalization bonds & raising capital from the market. Hence that part of the claim is TRUE. However, the impact of this on job creation & credit growth remains UNVERIFIED due to the lack of availability of data. Is there an alternative mechanism to facilitate consolidation by PSBs? The last claim is that \u2018approval for PSBs to amalgamate through an alternative mechanism to facilitate consolidation\u2019. A response in Lok Sabha in January 2018 states that \u2018the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts of 1970 and 1980 provide that the Central Government, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, may make a scheme, for the amalgamation of any nationalized bank with any other nationalized bank or any other banking institution. Consolidation in Public Sector Banks (PSBs) has been discussed by various committees and their reports, viz., Narasimham Committee (1998), Indian Banks\u2019 Association Report (2004), Planning Commission Report (2008), Leeladhar Committee (2008) and Nayak Committee (2014). These committees recommended encouragement and promotion of consolidation within PSBs through the merger and amalgamation route. Taking note of these recommendations, with a view to facilitate consolidation among the nationalized banks to create strong and competitive banks, Government has put in place an approval framework for proposals to amalgamate nationalized banks\u2019. In September 2018, it was approved that Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank may consider amalgamation of the three banks through the Alternative Mechanism (AM). Claim: Approval of PSBs to amalgamate through an alternative mechanism to facilitate consolidation. Fact: With a view to facilitate consolidation among the nationalized banks to create strong and competitive banks, Government has put in place an approval framework for proposals to amalgamate nationalized banks. Hence, the claim is TRUE. This story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.

        "claim": "\"Is it an act of mercy to throw 24 million people off of health insurance, so Republicans can hand billionaires a massive new tax giveaway?\"",
        "doc": "Gift Article Share Democratic lawmakers have made a number of misleading claims about the House Republican replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act and findings in the Congressional Budget Office report. We compiled a roundup of their talking points, as a companion to our fact-check of White House claims about the CBO report. \u201cIs it an act of mercy to throw 24 million people off of health insurance, so Republicans can hand billionaires a massive new tax giveaway?\u201d \u2014 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), news conference, March 16 \u201cBut what this bill does is it takes away health care from 14 million people in the next year, 24 million over ten years.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d March 16 \u201cActually, according to the CBO score, 14 million people will lose their insurance next year and 24 million people ultimately will lose their insurance.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Linda T. S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.), news briefing, March 15 The two headline-grabbing estimates from the CBO report have been taken out of context by some lawmakers, including Pelosi and S\u00e1nchez. The CBO estimated that under the GOP replacement bill, 14 million fewer people would be insured in 2018 than under the current health-care law and 24 million fewer people insured by 2026. But this does not mean all of the 14 million or 24 million will be \u201cthrown off\u201d health insurance or \u201close\u201d health insurance. Many of the people who would be uninsured, at least initially, would choose not to have insurance, because they had decided to obtain health insurance only to avoid a penalty under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate; the replacement bill eliminates the mandate. Others, such as elderly Americans, would not get insurance because the premiums are too high. (The replacement bill would allow the elderly to be charged five times as much as the youngest insured, compared with a 3:1 ratio under the ACA.) Many of the uninsured people would lose insurance because of reductions in Medicaid enrollment \u2014 after some states discontinue the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Advertisement The CBO estimated that the GOP bill would lead to 14 million fewer people insured than under Obamacare by 2018. Six million of 14 million would be people who now have coverage in the individual insurance market; 5 million would be people with coverage under Medicaid; and 2 million would be people with coverage through their employers, who also would no longer be required to provide insurance. (The remainder come from other insurance shifts.) \u201cMost of the reductions in coverage in 2018 and 2019 would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate,\u201d the CBO found. The CBO estimated that health insurance premiums would be 10 percent lower in 2026 than projected under current law. That\u2019s because insurance premiums would spike for older people (20 to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old) and many older people would drop out of the insurance markets. Then the pool of people getting insurance would be younger and healthier, leading to lower premiums than currently projected. But it\u2019s important to remember that it does not mean that premiums would decline by 10 percent, just that they would increase at a lower rate than now projected. Advertisement \u201cIf this legislation is passed and millions of people are thrown off of health insurance, not able to get to a doctor when they must, thousands of Americans will die.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), quoted in news article, March 13 Sanders repeated a version of a Four-Pinocchio claim after the CBO report was released this week. However, Sanders spoke in broader terms this time (\u201cthousands of Americans will die\u201d) rather than using a specific number (36,000) that was so dubious that it earned Four Pinocchios. Previously, Sanders had cited a calculation from ThinkProgress, a left-leaning website, assuming that 29.8 million people would lose their insurance and that one person will die for every 830 people who lose insurance. As we noted in our January fact-check, the 29.8 million figure was a pretty big assumption. It was based on a report that assumed Republicans will repeal parts of the law through the reconciliation process without outlining any replacement plan, thus leading to a near collapse of the nongroup insurance market. Advertisement The actual GOP replacement plan, of course, doesn\u2019t support those assumptions. The CBO found that 24 million people would become uninsured compared with the current law, over 10 years (not immediately). The CBO didn\u2019t calculate the bill\u2019s impact on mortality. That takes away one of the main assumptions made in the original calculation on which Sanders relies, and it makes his claim questionable. Plus, he again said that thousands \u201cwill\u201d die \u2014 rather than \u201ccould\u201d die \u2014 stating calculations based on assumptions as a definitive fact. \u201c#ReadtheBill & you\u2019ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), post on Twitter, March 8 #ReadtheBill & you\u2019ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care. pic.twitter.com/g9Q9onJH1c \u2014 Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 8, 2017 Baldwin\u2019s tweet is misleading. The GOP replacement bill would repeal an Obamacare cap of $500,000 on how much insurance companies can deduct on their tax returns from their chief executives\u2019 salaries. The cap applies to how much corporations can deduct \u2014 not the individual executive\u2019s tax liability, as PolitiFact Wisconsin noted. Advertisement According to CNNMoney: \u201cFive major insurers paid their CEO\u2019s $73 million in 2015, the most recent year for which pay has been reported. Only $2.5 million of that was deductible under Obamacare tax laws. But more than $70 million of that would be deductible under the proposed Republican legislation.\u201d In general, other types of businesses face a $1 million deduction limit for executive compensation. The cap also restricted corporations from making tax deductions on stock options and other \u201cperformance-based\u201d pay for the executives. So Baldwin and others argue that eliminating the cap would give incentive to companies to pay their executives more, since they\u2019d make up for some of it through lower taxes. Removing the cap would ultimately boost the incomes of top executives, who stand to gain from their companies\u2019 profitability, they say. So while getting rid of the cap may make it easier for insurance companies to boost executive compensation, Baldwin goes too far in saying that the bill would allow executives to \u201cpersonally make millions.\u201d Advertisement Plus, we\u2019ll note that top executives already make millions.

        "claim": "\"The elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding.\"",
        "doc": "Questions about climate change shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise at the confirmation hearing for Michael Huebsch to join the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. After all, the state agency regulates electricity prices, power plant construction and the development of wind and solar power. All play a role in the amount of carbon emissions that utilities generate in Wisconsin. Huebsch, a former Republican state lawmaker, served as secretary of the Department of Administration under Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed him to the PSC. The question came up during the end of Huebsch\u2019s April 7, 2015 appearance before the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. State Sen. Mark Miller (D-Monona) asked Huebsch for his views about \"whether or not our activities in terms of energy generation are contributing to climate change?\" Huebsch responded that humans have can have an impact on climate change, but said he didn\u2019t believe it is \"anywhere near the level of impact of just the natural progression of our planet.\" He added: \"You know, the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding.\" That one, well, erupted on social media. Critics questioned the science behind the claim, which has been repeated numerous times by those who do not believe human activity is causing the planet to warm. When we asked Huebsch for his evidence, he responded by forwarding us an email he had sent to Miller after the hearing. \"I answered a question you put to me inaccurately and I want to set the record straight,\" Huebsch wrote. \"To your question regarding global climate change I indicated global volcanic activity can equal the emission output by the automobiles in the United States. That is inaccurate and I apologize for the error.\" He added: \"While the scientific community recognizes the natural impact on climate change due to carbon (CO2)and sulfur (SO2) emissions from volcanic activity, those emissions do not equate to the annual emissions from United States automobiles and other fossil fuel based transportation. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\" Oh. All that said, let\u2019s take a closer look the comparison. Volcanoes: A frequently cited 2011 report by Terrance Gerlach, a volcano expert with the United States Geological Survey, compared carbon emissions from volcanoes and all human activity -- not just motor vehicles. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 was one of the largest ever recorded. That event sent about 0.05 gigatons into the atmosphere. Vehicles: According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Gerlach\u2019s report says that vehicles worldwide contributed 3 gigatons a year in greenhouse gases. The EPA estimate puts the U.S. share of that at just under 2 gigatons. By either measure, that\u2019s far, far more that a volcanic eruption. The Gerlach report contained this conclusion: \"Do the Earth\u2019s volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities? Research findings indicate that the answer to this frequently asked question is a clear and unequivocal, \u2018No.\u2019\" Our rating Huebsch, the latest appointee to the agency that regulates utilities in Wisconsin, testified that \"the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding.\" When we asked about his comments, Huebsch issued an email saying his answer to the climate change question was wrong, and apologized. We rate his claim False.",

        "claim": "In a day, Italy sent home more than 14,000 patients after treating them with Aspirin and Apronax.",
        "doc": "We've been asked by a reader to check a series of claims about Italy, Covid-19 and 5G. We've seen variations of the text being shared on social media and via blog posts . Almost all of the claims\u2014that Covid-19 is caused by a bacteria, that it is related to 5G, that autopsies were banned, and Italy broke rules to perform them\u2014are false. \"Italy has become the first Country in the world to conduct an \"AUTOPSY\" on a Covid-19 dead body, & after carrying out a comprehensive Scientific investigation they found out that Covid-19 as a VIRUS doesn't Exist, it's all just a Global Scam\u2026\" Italy was not the first country to perform a post-mortem on a Covid-19 patient. Forensic scientists in Wuhan, China performed post-mortems as early as 16 February , which was before the first detected Covid-19 death in Italy, on 21 February . Italian post-mortems did not discover that the virus causing Covid-19 doesn't exist. \"People are actually dying as a result of \"Amplified Global 5G Electromagnetic Radiation Poisoning\"\" Covid-19 is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2, not 5G. The symptoms of Covid-19 and radiation poisoning are completely different. 5G is the next generation of wireless network technology. 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves \u2014a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays). These radio waves are non-ionising , meaning they don't damage the DNA inside cells. Public Health England has said that there's no \"convincing evidence\" that exposure below the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will only be in the tens of GHz . \"Italian doctors, disobeyed the world health law (W.H.O), Which is NOT to carry out AUTOPSIES\" It's not true that the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that post mortems could not take place. The WHO released guidance on 24 March on safety measures for managing bodies and performing post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19. It's true that Italian doctors also performed post-mortems on Covid-19 patients. \"Italy defeats the so-called Covid-19, which is nothing other than \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation\"(Thrombosis) And the way to combat it, that is, its cure, is with \"Antibiotics, Anti-inflammatories and Anticoagulants\"(ASPIRIN)\" The idea that Covid-19 patients have been misdiagnosed, and actually have disseminated intravascular coagulation, is incorrect, as we have discussed before . Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be present in Covid-19 pneumonia patients, but it's not the case that patients have that instead of Covid-19. Antibiotics are not used to directly treat viruses, though can be given to Covid-19 patients who are suffering from secondary bacterial infections. The anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is being tested to see whether it can help Covid-19 patients, and the anticoagulant heparin has been used in some cases to treat Covid-19 illness. Aspirin can be used for pain relief in adults if they have a cough or cold but is not a specific cure or treatment for Covid-19. \"Something else, according to Italian pathologists. The ventilators and the intensive care unit were never needed.\" We could find no record of Italian doctors or pathologists saying this. There was widespread coverage and studies of how many Covid-19 patients needed intensive care treatment in the country. Although there has been some debate about how ventilators are used, Covid-19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome , which will often lead to needing a ventilator . \"IN ITALY THE SO-CALLED GLOBAL COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS REVEALED NOT AS A VIRUS.\" Covid-19 illness is caused by a virus. Scientists have been studying the disease and its cause for several months now, and have sequenced the genetic material of the virus. \"If they get to contract the Covid-19 which is NOT A VIRUS as they have made us believe,but a BACTARIUM Which actually has been Amplified by 5G ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION that also produces INFLAMMATION and HYPOXIA\" It's true that people with Covid-19 can get secondary infections caused by bacteria, but the bacteria themselves don't cause Covid-19. There's absolutely no evidence that 5G radiation has any effect on the immune system, or Covid-19 illness. Hypoxia, which is a general term for low oxygen in the body, can be a symptom of Covid-19. It's not clear what exactly the post means by inflammation\u2014some serious effects of Covid-19 can be pneumonia, which is inflammation of the lung tissue, and some other fatal effects can be generally referred to as types of inflammation, for example sepsis . \"[People with Covid-19] Should do the following: They are going to take Aspirin 100mg and Apronax or Paracetamol\" Aspirin has not been proved to be an effective treatment for Covid-19, however, there is at least one study looking into this. 'Apronax' seems to be a brand name for the drug naproxen , which reduces swelling in people with conditions like gout. This isn't yet recommended for treating Covid-19 either, but a trial on its efficacy is taking place in France. Paracetamol is not a specific cure for Covid-19, but it can be used to ease mild symptoms of the disease. \"Covid-19 does is to clot the blood,causing the person to develop a thrombosis and the blood not to flow and not oxygenate the heart and lungs Which makes the person to die quickly due to not being able to breathe\" It's true that severe Covid-19 illness can cause blood clotting problems . Pulmonary embolisms (when a blood vessel in the lungs gets blocked by a blood clot), strokes, and other issues caused by abnormal blood clotting have been seen in Covid-19 patients. This is not the only dangerous outcome of severe Covid-19 though. \"In Italy they screwed up the WHO protocol and did an AUTOPSY on a corpse that died from Covid-19,they cut the body and opened the arms and legs and the other sections of the body and realized that the veins were dilated and coagulated blood and all veins and arteries filled with thrombi, preventing the blood from flowing normally and bringing oxygen to all organs, mainly to the brain, heart and lungs and the patient ends up dying\" As above, Italy did not break any international law, or WHO protocol by performing autopsies. The \"thrombi\" the post refers to is the plural of thrombus, which is a blood clot. We couldn't find reporting from Italy making these claims, but it's true that some autopsies have found evidence of various types of blood clotting . However, we don't know if these blood clots were the cause of death for all these patients, as some seemingly suffered with other issues, such as pneumonia. \"the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the Covid-19 treatment protocols,and began to administer to their positive patients Aspirin 100mg and Apronax\" As we've discussed before, the Italian Medicines Agency doesn't mention aspirin on its page about drugs being used outside of clinical trials to treat patients with Covid-19. It doesn't mention 'apronax' or naproxen either. \"Ministry of Health released and sent home more than 14,000 patients in a single day.\" We can't find any record of a single day when 14,000 people were sent home from hospital in Italy. At the time of writing just under 170,000 people in Italy have recovered from Covid-19. \"there is an order to INCINERATE OR IMMEDIATELY BURY THE BODIES WITHOUT AUTOPSY, AND LABELED THEM AS HIGHLY POLLUTING\" No such order exists. \"they want to forcefully vaccinate Everyone around the world with the Bill Gates Nano-Tech Vaccines to control & connect them to 5-G Satellites & Mast Networks in order to reduce the World Population,which is Funded by the Bill Gates Depopulation Foundation\u2026\" In the UK, you cannot be forcibly vaccinated. \"WHO,CDC,NCDC,PTF in Over a Hundred Countries Globally are Funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Depopulation Foundation\" The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation does provide funding for the WHO, has funded projects run by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). PTF may stand for Presidential Task Force in Nigeria, which has received funding from the foundation. \"ITALIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH-UPDATE, CONCLUDED THAT AFTER THEIR RESEARCH, REALIZED THAT THE SO-CALLED CORONA-VIRUS A.K.A \"COVID-19\" ONLY EXIST ON THE PAGES OF NEWS PAPERS & ON EXTREME MEDIA PROPAGANDA\" No one from the Italian Ministry of Health has concluded that Covid-19 is fake.",

Adam Grachnik, director of corporate affairs for Walmart Canada, confirmed for Snopes that the company had never made any such announcement and does not have a policy of requiring customers to show proof of vaccination in order to enter stores, but noted that: \u201cWe continue to work with governments across the country and are following required restrictions.\u201d Update: In January 2022, new regulations took effect in Quebec mandating that certain retailers (such as Walmart) require all customers over the age of 13 to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination before they can enter stores. As a result, Walmart tweeted the following statement on Jan. 24: Hi. As directed by the Government of Quebec, we will implement the vaccine passport at our stores in Quebec.

        "claim": "In 2019, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that girls in an Illinois school district \"must shower with boys\" and had no right to privacy.",
        "doc": "In late 2019, we received inquiries from readers about several online articles whose headline proclaimed that a judge had ruled \u201chigh school girls must shower with boys,\u201d and that \u201cgirls have no right to privacy.\u201d For example, on Nov. 9 the website The Cube News published an article with the headline \u201cJudge Rules High School Girls MUST Shower With Boys, Says Girls Have No Right to Privacy.\u201d The webpage had a deceptive structure that cause readers who clicked on it to be redirected to several other spammy pages. The post reported that: A federal court permitted a lawsuit to proceed against an Illinois school district that allows high school boys to use girls\u2019 locker rooms, restrooms and showers in order to accommodate transgender students. But girls who don\u2019t want to be seen naked by boys got bad news, College Fix reports. The judge ruled that they have no right to \u201cvisual bodily privacy\u201d if the government says so. Dozens of families sued the Chicago-area Township High School District 211 three years ago due to its policy letting students as young as 14 choose to use the locker rooms of the opposite sex. \u201cAll the students must use the restroom with the knowledge that someone of the opposite sex is present or could walk in at any time,\u201d their lawyers at the Alliance Defending Freedom wrote in a background document on the case. It makes the stakes clear: \u201cIf our government is powerful enough to command innocent school children to disrobe in the presence of opposite-sex classmates, then there will be little it will not be powerful enough to do.\u201d In fact, the entire text of the piece was lifted from an April 2019 article on the right-leaning website The College Fix. Several other websites posted similar articles, also copied and pasted from The College Fix, throughout 2019. The article grossly oversimplified a complicated, multi-phase legal dispute involving students in a Chicago-area high school district, which went on for six years. In December 2013, a trans female student identified only as \u201cStudent A\u201d filed a complaint (with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union) with the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. The student claimed that Township High School District 211, just outside Chicago, had violated federal sex-discrimination law by denying her access to girls\u2019 locker rooms, and forcing her to change clothes by herself in a separate changing room. After a two-year investigation, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) concluded that the school had accommodated Student A\u2019s transitioning gender identity in several other ways, allowing her to use girls\u2019 bathrooms throughout the school, as well as consistently acknowledging and affirming her gender identity by using her preferred pronouns and her new legal name, formally registering her as a female student, and allowing her to participate in female athletics. However, the OCR found that the school had, for two years leading up to the complaint, repeatedly and consistently refused to allow Student A to use the girls\u2019 locker rooms, and that this had indeed constituted impermissible sex discrimination on several grounds. In December 2015, the school district and the OCR signed an agreement that contained a number of terms, the most relevant of which was that, going forward, Student A would be allowed to use the girls\u2019 locker rooms, and that the school would install \u201cprivacy curtains\u201d in each locker room, in order to accommodate both her privacy interests and the privacy interests of other female students, as they changed clothes. In May 2016, a group of parents, students and incoming high school students in District 211 calling themselves \u201cStudents and Parents for Privacy\u201d filed a lawsuit of their own. They claimed that the Department of Education had illegally exceeded its own authority by implementing a rule that redefined sex discrimination to encompass discrimination involving gender identity (as opposed to merely biological sex). The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, also alleged that District 211\u2019s locker room agreement had caused several female students \u201cembarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, fear, apprehension, stress, degradation, and loss of dignity,\u201d due to the experience or prospect of sharing locker rooms and bathrooms with Student A, and that those \u201cdamaging effects\u201d had been so severe as to impinge upon the quality of their access to education, physical education and athletics. Thus, the group alleged a violation of Title IX (the same federal sex discrimination law invoked by Student A), which states: \u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d The group also alleged that the locker room policy amounted to a violation of the students\u2019 constitutional right to bodily privacy and that, because the policy risked or involved other girls involuntarily seeing Student A in a state of undress, or involuntarily revealing themselves to Student A, while they themselves were in a state of undress, the parents\u2019 right to determine the manner of their children\u2019s upbringing and exposure to individuals biologically assigned to the opposite sex, in intimate surroundings, had also been violated. The lawsuit also more specifically argued that, because the locker room policy at times required girls to undress in the physical presence of a biologically assigned male, and to be physically present while a biologically assigned male undressed, the girls had been denied the ability to practice modesty, and therefore a violation of their constitutionally protected right to religious expression (and their parents\u2019 right to raise their children in accordance with their religious faith) had taken place. In June 2016, the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance, a non-profit group that advocates for LGBTQ school students, was added to the lawsuit, along with Student A and two other trans students in District 211 (\u201cStudent B\u201d and \u201cStudent C\u201d) as \u201cintervenors.\u201d In June 2017, the \u201cStudents and Parents for Privacy\u201d group dismissed the Departments of Education and Justice, meaning that the group was then only suing the school district as defendants, as well as the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance and Students A, B and C as intervenors. In February 2018, \u201cStudents and Parents for Privacy\u201d and their spokesperson, Victoria Wilson, resubmitted an amended complaint, which contained updated details and dropped its allegations against the federal government, but otherwise made broadly the same requests and legal arguments as the original complaint. In April 2018, the school district filed a motion to dismiss the claims against it, essentially asking the district court to throw out the case. Almost a year later, in March 2019, Judge Jorge Alonso ruled partly in favor of the motion to dismiss, but also partly against it, as follows: It was to this March 2019 order that the The College Fix referred when it wrote: \u201cA federal court permitted a lawsuit to proceed against an Illinois school district that allows high school boys to use girls\u2019 locker rooms, restrooms and showers in order to accommodate transgender students. But girls who don\u2019t want to be seen naked by boys got bad news: The judge ruled that they have no right to \u2018visual bodily privacy\u2019 if the government says so.\u201d And it was on the basis of that analysis that The Cube News published the headline \u201cJudge Rules High School Girls MUST Shower With Boys, Says Girls Have No Right to Privacy.\u201d Alonso did not rule that the girls in question \u201chave no right to privacy.\u201d That section of his order listed and discussed the many relevant constitutional privacy protections that are available to any individual (including the plaintiffs in this case) and recognized in federal and U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence. What he did do (as virtually all federal court rulings on constitutional questions must do) is locate the limits of those privacy rights. Alonso also did not rule or say that \u201chigh school girls must shower with boys.\u201d There are several significant flaws with that claim. Firstly, the locker room policy does not apply only to trans females and girls\u2019 locker rooms and bathrooms. It applies equally to the right of trans males to use boys\u2019 locker rooms, and indeed two of the three trans student intervenors in the case (Student B and Student C) are trans males. Secondly, the \u201cboys\u201d in question (both notional and actual) are biologically assigned as male but are trans females \u2014 living and identifying as girls, and formally registered by the school district as female students, officially participating in female athletics, and in the case of Student A, formally recognized as female on her passport. It is therefore flagrantly reductive, incomplete, and grossly misleading to describe a trans female student such as Student A as a \u201cboy,\u201d based only on her birth-assigned biological sex, and in the face of all other highly relevant factual considerations. Student A, in particular, had already begun hormone therapy and was therefore very much in the process of gender reassignment, in every sense, when the original controversy first arose. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, Alonso\u2019s March 2019 order very clearly and explicitly did not come to a definitive overall conclusion about the gender-affirming locker room agreement reached between the Office for Civil Rights and District 211. Alonso allowed \u201cStudents and Parents for Privacy\u201d to proceed with its lawsuit on the basis of the Title IX sex discrimination/harassment and religious-freedom claims. Based on Alonso\u2019s order, the lawsuit still had a substantive chance of succeeding, which could have resulted in the locker room policy being revoked, and trans students in District 211 no longer being allowed access to shared locker rooms of the sex opposite to their birth-assigned sex. Alonso actually facilitated such a potential outcome with his order. As it happened, the lawsuit proceeded no further, but not because of Alonso\u2019s order. Rather, in April 2019 \u201cStudents and Parents for Privacy\u201d voluntarily asked for its own lawsuit to be dismissed, and the lawsuit was formally brought to an end on April 15. In a Facebook post, the group vowed \u201cThis does not in any way mean we are giving up,\u201d but offered little explanation for the sudden decision to drop the lawsuit, apart from suggesting it might have been taken because the trans students at the center of the controversy had already graduated from District 211 high schools since the complaint was first filed in 2016. The broader dispute over equal and gender-affirming access to locker rooms and bathrooms has continued in District 211. In 2017, another trans female student, Nova Maday, sued the school district in Cook County Circuit Court, this time claiming the district had breached the Illinois Human Rights Act by failing to provide her full, unencumbered, equal access to girls\u2019 locker rooms, by either denying access to the locker rooms altogether, or insisting that she use privacy stalls inside the locker rooms. On Nov. 14, the District 211 school board voted to implement a new policy whereby trans students will be given full, equal access to locker rooms of their affirmed gender, without any specific conditions or limitations \u2014 an even more expansive policy than that first agreed to with the Department of Education in 2015.",

        "claim": "The city\u2019s 30 percent set aside for affordable housing in urban renewal areas is calculated citywide -- not district by district",
        "doc": "A recent proposal to spend some $20 million to renovate the Memorial Coliseum would, according to the Portland Development Commission, draw private investment to Portland\u2019s Rose Quarter.It would also drive down the amount of money being spent on affordable housing in the Oregon Convention Center urban renewal district, which includes the Coliseum, to 16 percent -- 10 percentage points short of the city\u2019s previously planned 26 percent.It\u2019s that last bit that got some attention in a recent article in The Oregonian, which asserted that the Coliseum upgrades \"would be funded by sidestepping Portland policy that a certain percent of urban renewal money be spent on affordable housing within specific districts.\"The same day the newspaper published the article, Mayor Sam Adams, who had included the Coliseum upgrades in his latest spending plan, pushed back.\"I raise this as we get into the general discussion because I think there's been some recent news coverage that would lead one to believe that the requirement was 30 percent in all districts,\" Adams said during a council meeting that night. \"It's a 30 percent citywide average. We specifically debated at that time the differences between the two. We knew that some districts would be more conducive, better cost benefit for subsidizing affordable housing expenditures, and others would be less.\"So is Adams right? PolitiFact Oregon delved into the historical record to find out.The concept of setting aside a certain amount for affordable housing stretches back to a resolution passed by the Portland City Council on April 20, 2006. Back then, Adams -- along with three other council members, including the mayor at the time -- voted to pass Resolution No. 36403.That resolution, in part, committed the council to establishing \"a policy to dedicate a percentage of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) revenues from all Urban Renewal Districts citywide to an affordable housing set aside fund.\"The resolution, however, didn\u2019t specify what the policy should look like. It didn\u2019t even specify the 30 percent figure.For those details, we need to fast-forward a few months to October 2006. We also need to introduce another player in all of this: the Portland Development Commission. At the time all of this was being hashed out, the PDC set its own budget and was the final word in development issues. These days, the agency looks to the City Council for its budget, though it still maintains a certain amount of independence.Anyhow, on Oct. 16, 2006, the PDC approved Resolution No. 6398 titled \"Adopting a tax increment financing for affordable housing policy and implementation plan to the City Council.\" Appended to the resolution was an action plan for designing just such a policy. And in that action plan was this: \"policy will establish a requirement that a minimum of 30 percent of all tax increment resources averaged across all URA (urban renewal areas) \u2026. be spent on Affordable Housing.\" Now, that bit only applied to \"new districts,\" not the Convention Center. The policy addressed the Convention Center area specifically, stating \"PDC will establish policy for the Oregon Convention Center Urban Renewal Area to spend a minimum of 26 percent \u2026 on Affordable Housing.\"In any case, the big takeaway here is the phrase \"averaged across all URA,\" which would seem to back up Adams.If only things had ended there.While the Development Commission was doing its thing, on Oct, 25, 2006, the Portland City Council passed its own related ordinance that stated: \"It is the policy of the City of Portland that 30 percent of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) over the life of an Urban Renewal District shall be dedicated to the development, preservation and rehabilitation of housing affordable to households \u2026\"That wording passed with yeas from all five council members -- including Adams.Now, that ordinance isn\u2019t super clear as to whether the policy was on a per-district basis or whether it was averaged. Thankfully, there\u2019s some evidence to help us interpret the intent of the council at the time.At the council meeting, then-Commissioner Erik Sten seemed to be under the impression that the City Council wanted a per-district commitment while the Development Commission had legislated a general 30 percent commitment. He wanted the two reconciled.The same day, the Portland Development Commission amended its plan. The revised plan said: \"Policy will establish a requirement that a minimum of 30 percent of all tax increment resources in each URA \u2026 be spent on Affordable Housing.\" Again, the plan put a 26 percent goal on the Convention Center separately.See that? \"In each URA \u2026\"About a year later, the Portland City Council took this plan and added it to its own ordinance calling it \"binding\" city policy.That seemed like a closed case to us. But we called Adams\u2019 office to see if we were missing anything. Here\u2019s what Amy Ruiz, the mayor\u2019s spokeswoman, had to say on the issue:\"We have a trio of City documents that all set city policy, and that all have slightly different wording on this topic, which makes it useful to look at the overall legislative history, including the council discussion when these votes were taken. Our city attorney's office did this, and notes that there is \u2018clear legislative history to support the conclusion that the 30% policy was meant to apply citywide, and there were statements by Commissioner Sten opposite that.\u2019\"Ultimately, as noted by the city attorney's office, these are all council policies. They are not state statutes. Where there's any ambiguity, it's up to the council to clarify if they want to. City policy is subject to change at any time by the council, while a state statute, as you know, is not.\"We asked her for a little more of the legislative history she mentioned given that the history we\u2019d seen seemed to indicate the council was deliberate in asking for the \"in each URA\" language.Ruiz referred back to the Oct. 18, 2006, meeting of the Portland City Council, specifically to the following remarks by PDC Chairman Mark Rosenbaum: \"In an unexpected circumstance, which we're not budgeted for at this point, in order to be true to our commitment of 30%, we would say, well [if we] didn't spend it in Lents, we'd have the opportunity to make up for it in the other four areas so we were consistent with our commitment. \u2026 We made it very clear that it is our policy to spend 30% in each district and only under an extreme circumstance would we vary and then if we did, we would be forced to make up for it elsewhere.\"If anything, though, that seemed to us to contradict the mayor\u2019s statement that the policy was 30 percent averaged across the city. It does allow for that as a bare minimum in case of extenuating circumstances, but as far as we can tell, that doesn\u2019t mean Adams was right when he said \"it\u2019s a 30 percent citywide average.\"The evidence at the time seems to clearly indicate that the goal and the aspiration of both the City Council and the Development Commission was to set aside 30 percent in each district and 26 percent specifically in the Coliseum area. It\u2019s also clear that the city officials knew there could be certain cases when that might be easier said than done and, as a result, gave themselves the cushion of 30 percent averaged across all districts.But that cushion was not the rule -- it was the exception.The PDC chairman\u2019s statement sums it up: We'll try for 30 in each and if we absolutely can't, then we'll make it up elsewhere.Adams, however, is asserting the the rule was always a 30 percent average. It\u2019s within his right to go that direction, but it seems off-base to claim now that his rule was the rule along. The city attorney's office can tell him that what he wants to do is legal, but that's not the same as the historical intent.We\u2019ll rate this one False. Comment on this item.",

        "doc": "As he moves toward a comeback bid for the White House, former President Donald Trump lashed out at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, portraying him as disloyal for not stepping aside and forgoing his own presidential ambitions. During a gubernatorial debate this past October, DeSantis would not say whether he will run for president. Trump may announce his campaign next week. As the rivalry has unfolded, on Truth Social this week, Trump suggested he had stopped a steal of DeSantis' 2018 gubernatorial election. Trump said DeSantis came to him in \"desperate shape\" and \"politically dead\" in 2017. Trump said he rescued DeSantis by endorsing him in the Republican primary in which he beat Adam Putnam, the state's two-time agriculture commissioner. Months later, Trump said he delivered victory to DeSantis in his race against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate. \"I was all in for Ron, and he beat Gillum, but after the Race, when votes were being stolen by the corrupt Election process in Broward County, and Ron was going down ten thousand votes a day, along with now-Senator Rick Scott, I sent in the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys, and the ballot theft immediately ended, just prior to them running out of the votes necessary to win. I stopped his Election from being stolen,\" Trump wrote Nov. 10 on Truth Social. DeSantis narrowly beat Gillum, as confirmed by a recount, in 2018. Could Trump have called someone at the Justice Department in November 2018 about the election in Broward? It's possible; we have no way to fact-check that part of his statement. But we can debunk Trump's assertion that votes were being \"stolen\" in Broward and that he stopped the steal. Broward County Commissioner Steve Geller told PolitiFact he was at the Broward vote counting site on Election Day and visited a couple of times in the weeks following. \"Unless the federal agents were undercover and didn't identify themselves, there was nobody there saying, 'Yes we are from the FBI or CIA or federal bureau of stopping the steal,'\" Geller said. \"There was no 'steal' for him to have stopped,\" Geller said, referring to Trump. A Broward County Supervisor of Elections spokesperson said the office had \"no documentation of any federal law enforcement presence during the 2018 elections\" and no evidence of corruption. The FBI had no comment for us about Trump's statement. We emailed Trump's spokespeople to ask for his evidence to support his statement and got no reply. Sarah Isgur, a former spokesperson for the Justice Department under Trump, tweeted Nov. 11 that the former president's claim about intervening in the 2018 election \"never happened.\" After Trump's endorsement, DeSantis clobbered Putnam, the presumptive GOP frontrunner and two-time agriculture commissioner, in the 2018 gubernatorial primary, but barely squeaked out a victory against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee. Days after the general election, GOP activists protested outside the Broward Supervisor of Elections' vote counting center. (This fact-checker spent one day at the protests.) The races for governor, U.S. Senate and state agricultural commissioner all fell into such close margins that they triggered recounts, as Florida state law requires. In the days following the election, Trump made allegations of voter fraud in Broward that were echoed by then-Gov. Rick Scott, who was declared the winner of his 2018 Senate race after a recount. As Broward election officials continued to count ballots, Trump called the rising number of \"found\" votes the \"Broward Effect\" and tweeted that he would send lawyers to \"expose the fraud!\" But under state law, officials had until noon Saturday following the election to finish vote counting. About two weeks after the 2018 election, a recount confirmed that DeSantis won by about 32,000 votes, or 0.4%. PolitiFact found there were mistakes by Broward election officials in 2018. For example, Scott's campaign noted that days after the election, Broward mixed about 20 rejected provisional ballots in with about 200 legitimate ones. But that's not the same as fraud. Brenda Snipes, Broward elections supervisor at that time and a Democrat, had a history of errors, sluggish vote counting and lawsuits. But none of that meant Snipes \u2014 or anyone in her office \u2014 tried to steal an election or acted criminally. Snipes ultimately resigned. Days after the election, Scott asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the vote counting and announced he would sue Broward and Palm Beach election supervisors. In April 2020, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement released a six-page summary of an investigation into allegations of Democrats committing fraud in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and said it found \"no evidence of fraudulent intent.\" Three people associated with Florida's Democratic Party altered the submission deadlines on affidavits to correct signature issues on mail-in ballots. However, the people had changed the form in anticipation of a court ruling to allow rejected mail-in ballots to be counted. The investigation found the people \"had no intent to disseminate\" the form without the court's prior approval. Florida Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox said there was insufficient \"evidence to support prosecution\" in that case, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The Broward County auditor wrote a report in 2020 stating that the elections office in 2018 had exhibited poor planning and waste and he was \"unable to provide assurance over the accuracy\" of the results. But county commissioners and Peter Antonacci, who was appointed supervisor, pushed back on that conclusion. Antonacci said he agreed with individual audit findings but not the overall conclusion, and added that the findings \"do not change the outcome of any race,\" the Sun Sentinel reported. It is rare for federal law enforcement to investigate allegations of voter fraud. \"Most allegations of voter fraud are first brought to light by private attorneys hired by candidates, and then they go beg local authorities and maybe local authorities will pay attention if they think there is proof,\" said J.C. Planas, a Florida election lawyer and former Republican state legislator, who is now a Democrat. When voter fraud is alleged, it's typically in local races or primaries and not statewide general elections, Planas said. \"I have been doing this for a long time, and I have yet to see any credible allegation of fraud in a general election, because there is no way to do voter fraud without a voter's compliance,\" Planas said. We have found sporadic voter fraud convictions in recent years in Florida, but they are not orchestrated efforts to steal elections. They are generally people acting alone \u2014 for example, casting a mail ballot in the name of a dead relative. Also, the FBI coming to Broward would have generated news reports, Planas said. \"Trump may very well have called people,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean they showed up.\" Trump said in the 2018 Florida governor's race \"votes were being stolen by the corrupt election process in Broward. \u2026 I sent in the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys, and the ballot theft immediately ended. \u2026 I stopped his Election from being stolen.\" Trump did not support his statement with evidence. We don't know whether Trump called the Justice Department and asked it to investigate Broward's elections in November 2018, but we found no evidence of a federal investigation. State law enforcement investigated allegations of Democrats committing fraud in a few counties, including Broward, and found \"no evidence of fraudulent intent.\" DeSantis was declared the winner because he received the most votes, confirmed by a recount. We found no evidence of a criminal plot in Broward to \"steal\" the election from DeSantis. We rate this statement Pants on Fire! RELATED: Why does the Justice Department monitor polling sites?

        "claim": "In 2005, Senator Hillary Clinton co-sponsored a bill to make flag burning a punishable offense.",
        "doc": "On 29 November 2016, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted a controversial opinion about the criminality of flag burning, leading to secondary rumors that his former political rival, Hillary Clinton, once supported criminalizing the act of protest. In his tweet, Trump suggested that \u201cno one\u201d should be permitted to burn the flag, adding that offenders ought to be punished with losing their United Statescitizenship or spending a year in jail. Almost as quickly as the controversy started, other rumors erupted that in 2005, then-Senator Hillary Clinton sponsored a bill making flag burning an offense punishable by one year in prison or a fine of $100,000. That bill (S.1911, The Flag Protection Act of 2005) was co-sponsored by Clinton, and proposed in part: Any person who shall intentionally threaten or intimidate any person or group of persons by burning, or causing to be burned, a flag of the United States shall be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both. The law was notpassed (or considered) by Congress. A critical New York Times editorial published on 7 December 2005 provided context for the proposal: The bill attempts to equate flag-burning with cross-burning, which the Supreme Court, in a sensible and carefully considered 2003 decision, said could be prosecuted under certain circumstances as a violation of civil rights law. It\u2019s a ridiculous comparison. Burning a cross is a unique act because of its inextricable connection to the Ku Klux Klan and to anti-black violence and intimidation. A black American who wakes up to see a cross burning on the front lawn has every right to feel personally, and physically, threatened. Flag-burning has no such history. It has, in fact, no history of being directed against any target but the government. As the editorial went on to explain, Clinton\u2019s justification for sponsoring the bill was the notion that flag burning could be used to intimidate or threaten American citizens. While the bill was never passed, Trump echoed its proposed $100,000 fine (although \u201closs of citizenship\u201d was not included in the 2005 legislation).",

Trump just resigned from Costco: pic.twitter.com/kCcNj5Uc6I \u2014 Rogue WH Snr Advisor (@roguesnradvisor) February 5, 2021 The supposed letter was addressed to \u201cMr. Jelinek,\u201d presumably Costco CEO Walter Craig Jelinek: The Office of Donald J. Trump February 4th, 2021 Mr. Jelinek, I am writing to inform you that effective immediately I am terminating my membership with Costco. For the past fourteen years I have been a major supporter of your stores, but that ends today. I have heard from many, many people about your company\u2019s plan to boycott products that Americans love simply because they are great admirers of mine like Mike Lindell, a great patriot. Let me tell you: this is un-American, and probably illegal. Who are you to say what a business can or can\u2019t do? You know, frankly, I\u2019ve never really used the membership anyway. Who needs an eight pound tub of coconut clusters? And the piles of clothing in the center of the store, My God. Nobody wants Kirkland jeans. I have been a big supporter of business, nobody loves business more than me, I did the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever seen, a tax cut that helped you and helped your board, and this is what I get in return? A boycott? I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. To be honest, the membership wasn\u2019t even for me, I bought it, a lot of people bought it, I let people use the card, many of them got the hot dogs, the chickens, they returned the card, I never even used it. If I had only known what was going on behind the scenes I would have canceled it earlier. You have done a huge amount of damage to this country, worse than Wal-Mart and probably Trader Joes. It\u2019s not good, and people are seeing it. Consider this my final interaction with your company. Regards,President Donald J. Trump Some Twitter users said that they didn\u2019t know what to think of the letter. \u201cIt really had me thinking it was real,\u201d said one tweet with more than 700 likes. \u201cWait\u2026 I really don\u2019t know\u2026 Is this real?,\u201d tweeted another. @jimfish98 tweeted: \u201cThe most fucked up part of this post is I can\u2019t tell if its satire or real because I would never put this past him.\u201d Others had similar thoughts, including @lelelom: \u201cI can\u2019t even tell the real letters from the fake letters anymore.\u201d However, the letter addressed to Costco with Trump\u2019s letterhead appeared to be nothing more than a bit of comedy. The author of the humorous and satirical note left several clues that it was not written by Trump. First, Costco did not \u201cboycott\u201d MyPillow. As of Feb. 6, 2021, the company\u2019s products were still for sale on the Costco website. The \u201ceight-pound tub of coconut clusters\u201d was another hint, as was the dig at Kirkland jeans. The letter claimed the Trump tax cuts helped the Costco CEO and the board. This was also a bit of a poke at the fact that some critics claimed his tax cuts benefitted wealthy Americans. Further, Costco membership cards include a picture of the member. It would not be possible to loan a card to a number of people.

Trump also posted a letter to the Gab social network regarding his second impeachment trial, but he made no mention of Costco. In sum, Trump did not send the above-displayed letter to cancel his Costco membership. The humorous note looked to be inspired by a real notice that he sent earlier that week to resign from SAG.",

        "claim": "\"One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies.\"",
        "doc": "Rep. Patrick Kennedy gave a strong defense of Democratic plans for health reform on the House floor, attacking Republican opponents as defenders of insurance companies. \"The other side talks about the health care reform bill costing a lot of money,\" Kennedy said. \"Right now, consumers in America are spending millions and millions of dollars paying that to the insurance companies. One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies. That's why the Democratic proposal restricts the amount of money that insurance companies can spend on bureaucracy.\" The idea that insurance companies get a third of all health spending in the country struck us as suspicious. And sure enough, our research showed that Kennedy was mixing up his statistics. To start with, every health insurance company is different, and there are different ways to count administrative expenses. Generally speaking, the most efficient insurers cover large groups of employees, while the least efficient sell policies to individuals. Nevertheless, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency, publishes national health expenditure data, which include a breakdown of \"The Nation's Health Dollar.\" The most recent data for 2007 show that private insurers get a little less than 7 percent of the nation's health care spending. The 7 percent number also includes some of the administrative costs of government health insurance programs and charity programs, but the center said most of that is for private insurers. We reviewed another study done by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It looked at administrative costs from a different angle, trying to focus on what percentage of health insurance premiums went to patient costs. Keep in mind, spending on private health insurance premiums is less than all national health care spending, which includes government spending for Medicare and Medicaid, and other expenditures. The CBO included a bunch of things under administrative costs: marketing; claims processing; managing contracts with doctors and hospitals; quality assurance; regulatory compliance; information technology expenses; general overhead; profits and taxes. It found that the percentage of premiums going to all these activities was 12 percent. We asked Kennedy's office about his statement, and staffers said Kennedy meant to say that he was talking about administrative expenses throughout the health care system. They sent us a study from theNew England Journal of Medicinethat examined administrative costs for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, home care agencies and employers who provide insurance. The study found total administrative costs for all those groups accounted for 31 percent of health care expenditures in the United States. Still, that's not anywhere close to what Kennedy said. He said that \"One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies.\" The actual number is about 7 percent. We rate Kennedy's statement False.",

Choose your plan ArrowRight The release of the CDC\u2019s 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) last month spawned banner headlines about teen girls in the United States being swamped in a wave of violence and trauma. The survey showed a sharp increase in the percentage of girls who have considered suicide or have felt persistently sad or hopeless. The survey also suggested a dramatic increase in the percentage of girls who had been raped. But in a statement to The Fact Checker, a CDC spokesman acknowledged that the rate of growth highlighted in the news release \u2014 27 percent \u2014 was the result of rounding the numbers from more precise decimal-point results. The revised figure when calculated with decimal points is 18.4 percent. In addition, some experts have questioned whether the results have been affected by many schools refusing to ask the question about rape. Advertisement After The Fact Checker\u2019s inquiry, the CDC edited the news release and an accompanying page on its website to remove the reference to a 27 percent increase \u2014 a number that figured prominently in news reports at the time. The agency also removed a graphic that had highlighted a 20 percent increase in the girls reporting sexual violence in the past four years; the figure using decimal points is 17.8 percent. The revised news release removes all references to percentage changes in the data. The CDC\u2019s 2019 user guide to interpreting YRBS trend data warns that \u201cusing the percent change can be misleading.\u201d The CDC\u2019s focus on the challenges facing teenage girls \u2014 especially regarding mental health \u2014 is timely and important. But the CDC\u2019s use of inflated figures on sexual violence could undermine its larger message. CDC\u2019s February presentation Experts in violence against children had been surprised by the CDC\u2019s February news release but have been stymied in understanding how it was developed because the full YRBS data set will not be released until April. Besides the CDC\u2019s use of round numbers to calculate percentage changes in its news release and news conference, experts identified possible flaws in how the information was collected \u2014 particularly the fact that a significant number of schools surveyed refused to ask this question. Advertisement That could have biased the sample by possibly removing jurisdictions with lower rates of reporting rape and sexual violence, experts said. Other survey questions with more robust participation by schools \u2014 such as violence in dating and violence in bullying \u2014 indicated declines, not increases. \u201cThey should have alerted readers of the release that many of the other indicators of violence exposure in the YRBS were flat or showed declines,\u201d said David Finkelhor, a University of New Hampshire professor who is director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center. \u201cThe CDC publicity about mental health and suicide ideation among girls has a strong case that is supported by other sources of evidence. But the generalization about violence does not have such support.\u201d The CDC\u2019s public presentation reported that in 2019, 11 percent of teenage girls said that sometime in their life, they had been forced into sex. By 2021, the number had grown to 14 percent. But, the spokesman acknowledged, the more precise figures were 11.4 percent in 2019 and 13.5 percent in 2021. That represents an 18.4 percent increase \u2014 lower than the initial figure, 27 percent. Advertisement Similar rounding also inflated the increase in the percentage of teen girls who reported they had experienced sexual violence in the past year, though not to the same extent. \u201cCDC acknowledges the differences in these calculations and those made from whole numbers,\u201d spokesman Paul Fulton Jr. said in a statement, adding that the agency used \u201cwhole numbers in the text to make the findings more accessible to a broader audience.\u201d Other surveys with conflicting results Finkelhor said the CDC\u2019s assertion that teenage girls faced \u201crecord high levels of violence\u201d was undercut by other surveys. For instance, the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, has indicated that rape and sexual assault of 12-to-17-year-olds has been declining for three decades. Advertisement \u201cThe NCVS data, which is well known and well regarded by violence epidemiologists, should have tempered their claims about record highs,\u201d Finkelhor said. \u201cThere has been a remarkably large decline in crime and abuse over the last 30 years that has benefited children tremendously, but it has gotten little press attention. Perhaps it is reversing, but there are not enough data points over enough time to draw that conclusion.\u201d Another CDC tool, the Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES), is conducted online and has a more robust response rate for the same questions on lifetime prevalence of rape and recent sexual violence. The most recent ABES also was conducted in 2021 \u2014 in the spring rather than the fall like the YRBS. In the ABES, 10.4 percent said they had once been raped (in contrast to 13.5 percent in the YRBS), and 15.3 percent said they had experienced sexual violence in the past year (in contrast to 17.9 percent in the YRBS). Asked about the NCVS and the ABES, Fulton said: \u201cWe would not compare data across surveys that have very different methods. We do not believe those are reliable comparisons.\u201d Missing answers on key questions David Stein, a mathematician who studies the rise of adolescent suicide, has dug deep into the available YRBS data and said there has been a sharp increase in the number of schools not giving students questions on sexual violence and rape. In 2017, 4 percent of the students did not answer the question on sexual violence by anyone, but in 2019, this portion rose to 25 percent. For rape, the frequency of missing answers rose from 2 percent in 2017 to 18 percent to 2019. Advertisement Fulton said the percentages of students not answering the question were similar in 2021 \u2014 18 percent on the rape question and 23 percent on the sexual violence question. Deep in a report on the 2019 survey, the CDC acknowledged the spike in missing answers on these questions. \u201cMost of these missing data can be attributed to some selected schools administering YRBS questionnaire versions that did not include these questions,\u201d the report said. Fulton said the CDC conducts a national survey and a scientific sample that is representative of all public and private school students in grades nine through 12 in the 50 states and D.C. Then it provides funding for state and local governments to do their own surveys. \u201cThese areas have wide discretion in choosing survey questions and are only required to use two-thirds of CDC\u2019s standard questionnaire,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cthe national data are weighted to adjust for school and student nonresponse and to make the data representative of the population of students from which the sample was drawn.\u201d Finkelhor and Stein said that, nonetheless, the large percentage of students not being asked these questions could have affected the results. Advertisement Stein\u2019s analysis of the available 2019 data suggests girls who were not given the questions were considerably younger than those who had received the questions and thus less likely to have had sex and to be sexually active \u2014 two factors, he said, that are associated with a higher risk of being a victim of sexual violence. Elizabeth L. Jeglic, a clinical psychologist who studies sexual violence prevention at John Jay College in New York, said she could not comment specifically on the CDC methodology, but she said sampling and response rate can affect findings. \u201cIf the question is asked about lifetime occurrence and younger girls are not being sampled (or less likely to be sampled) you will likely see a higher prevalence rate as older girls will have more years to experience sexual violence than younger girls,\u201d she said in an email. Stein noted that in 2019, there was a curious divergence in the results of two YRBS questions having to do with dating violence. The question concerning sexual dating violence \u2014 when someone was forced to kiss, touch or have intercourse \u2014 had a big jump in missing answers. The percentage of students reporting such violence increased substantially, reversing a previous decline. But the question on physical dating violence \u2014 when someone was physically hurt on purpose \u2014 had no change in missing answers and showed no reversal in trends. Advertisement The rape question asks whether a person had been forced into sex anytime in their life, as opposed to many other questions that ask about violence in the previous year. Another reason the increase reported by the CDC surprised researchers is that it is unusual for a lifetime measure to spike so much between biennial surveys because there is significant overlap in the students being surveyed two years apart \u2014 half of the high school population surveyed in 2019 would be in the 2021 survey. Stein said the best explanation is not a sharp increase in rapes but that the missing data affected the result. Janet Lauritsen, former president of the American Society of Criminology, said the NCVS also has had a decline in youth participation since the introduction of the sexual orientation and gender identity questions in 2016. \u201cUntil the CDC presents a thorough assessment of nonresponse and weighting in the YRBS, it is very difficult to say which data source presents a more accurate depiction of the changes in sexual violence among youth,\u201d Lauritsen said. \u201cNo data source is without error, and my personal opinion at this time is that until the YRBS data are made public and such an assessment is done, I have more confidence in the youth trends presented in the NCVS.\u201d Not the first increase The CDC also claimed that the jump in students reporting a rape in their lifetimes was the \u201cthe first increase since the CDC began monitoring this measure.\u201d Advertisement But the figure had jumped previously in consecutive surveys, such as from 10.3 percent to 11.9 percent from 2001 to 2003 (a 15.5 percent increase). Fulton said that the CDC was referring to a 10-year trend, 2011 to 2021, and that the agency was comparing that decade to the 2007-2017 period and the 2009-2019 period. \u201cIn that [2017] report and again for 2019 (2009-2019) there were no significant increases in forced sex across those time periods,\u201d he said. But his statement acknowledged there was an increase \u2014 just not a \u201csignificant\u201d increase. The percentage of girls reporting a rape in their lifetimes did not change from 2007 to 2017 but rose from 10.5 percent in 2009 to 11.4 percent in 2019. That\u2019s an increase of 8.6 percent. The CDC\u2019s website has not yet corrected this error. The Pinocchio Test In its public presentation, the CDC had a responsibility to use accurate statistics on the percentage change in sexual violence, given how those numbers were certain to appear in news reports. The CDC should also more clearly state that some of the results in recent years may be affected by these questions not being asked of a large percentage of students. Acknowledging limitations in some parts of the survey will give people more confidence in the rest of the data. The CDC earns Two Pinocchios.

        "claim": "During U.S. President Joe Biden's first presidential news conference on March 25, 2020, he briefly walked away from the lectern as a reporter asked him a question.",
        "doc": "On March 25, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden held his first news conference since taking the presidential oath of office more than two months earlier. As viewers worldwide watched the event live, social media users remarked on an odd moment toward the end of the news conference when Biden left the lectern and continued talking even though he wasn\u2019t wearing a microphone. One Twitter user, for instance, circulated a video clip that they framed as evidence of Biden simply \u201cwalking away\u201d as a reporter asked him a question, as if he were leaving. \u201cWhy did Biden just get up and walk away in the middle of a question? Did he forget what he was doing? No worries, he circled right back,\u201d read the tweet. Others theorized that Biden forgot he was at a news conference and thought it was a town hall, or that he is \u201csenile\u201d and had simply wandered away from the podium for no reason at all. To investigate whether the online content authentically described a moment of the news conference in the White House\u2019s East Room, Snopes obtained an archived version of the above-displayed tweet after it was removed from the social media site. Snopes reviewed video footage of the event confirming that Biden indeed stepped briefly away from the lectern as reporter Janet Rodriguez of Univision asked questions. The moment happened about one hour into the news conference, according to C-SPAN\u2019s video recording of the event. Rodriguez first asked when the Biden administration would fulfill its promises of improving facilities for migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, specifically unaccompanied children and toddlers. Then, she asked for more specifics on the administration\u2019s plan to address the root problems for why people in Central American nations seek refuge in the U.S. As she completed that question, Biden took about four steps in Rodriguez\u2019s direction while looking at her. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t guarantee that,\u201d he said, while out of reach of the lectern\u2019s microphone. (You can read the White House\u2019s transcript of Biden\u2019s answers to reporters\u2019 questions here.) He then walked back to the lectern, as shown around the 60-minute mark in this C-SPAN video: However, based on the video evidence, it is purely speculative to frame that moment as an example of Biden trying to leave the event prematurely and catching himself mid-faux pas, or forgetting the function of the event, or simply wandering away. Furthermore, when he moved, the president walked toward Rodriguez (in the opposite direction of the exit). A more plausible reason for his movement would be to hear the reporter more clearly (she was wearing a mask) as she asked her question. In the end, however, all these various explanations for why Biden walked away from the lectern are speculative. But considering the C-SPAN video footage of the press conference, which shows the president moving several steps toward Rodriguez as she asks a question, we rate the claim that he did so \u201cTrue.\u201d",

        "doc": "In July 2017, an assortment of unreliable web sites published articles reporting that two of U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughters were arrested and charged with trafficking cocaine. That the reports were pure bunk was immediately evident from the inaccuracy and inconsistency of their \u201cfacts.\u201d For example, FreedomCrossroads.us named the arrested daughters as \u201cJulie Marie\u201d and \u201cNicole Lynn\u201d: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s two youngest daughters, Julie Marie and Nicole Lynn, were arrested and charged in Berkeley, California for drug trafficking. Their lawyer managed to keep the arrest quiet for the sake of an ongoing investigation and plea deal, but now that they were taken in full view of the public into federal court for arraignment, the cat is out of the bag. The two women, 24 and 27-years-old, were caught at the border with more than 200 pounds of pure cocaine in their Winnebago. The girls tried to use their name to get through customs without being searched. It didn\u2019t work. According to Our Land of the Free, on the other hand, the daughters\u2019 names were \u201cLouanne\u201d and \u201cMarissa\u201d: Nancy Pelosi is now in more trouble than she ever bargained for. Her two adult daughters, Louanne and Marissa, caught red-handed at the Mexican border with enough cocaine to choke the Kentucky Derby, turned her over as the operation\u2019s mastermind. The two young women, aged 21 and 26, turned state\u2019s evidence against the former Speaker of the House and walked out of jail with no charges against them, so their evidence must be strong. Pelosi was taken into custody at her California home without incident and posted $10 million bail less than an hour later. As it happens, Nancy Pelosi does have four daughters, but their names areNancy, Christine, Jacqueline, and Alexandra. There have been no reports in the mainstream media that any of them were arrested for smuggling drugs or anything else. Nor, needless to say, was the minority leader herself taken into custody at her California home.

        "claim": "Eagles retreat at age 40 to grow new beaks, talons",
        "doc": "\"By the age of 40, the eagle's claws become too long and supple, and it cannot grab its prey with it. Its beak becomes too long and curved, preventing it from eating. The feathers on its wings and chest become too thick and heavy and prevent it from flying. The eagle is now faced with a choice: either death, or a long and painful period of change, lasting 150 days,\" says a December 17, 2021 Facebook post. \"It flies to its nest on the top of the mountain and beats its beak against the rock for a long time until the beak breaks and comes off... Then it waits for a new beak to grow and tear its claws out. When new claws grow, the eagle pulls out its over-heavy plumage on its chest and wings... And then, after 5 months of pain and torment, with a new beak, claws and plumage, the eagle is reborn and can live for another 30 years,\" the post says. The claim -- which also appeared on Facebook in December 2021 here -- has circulated since at least 2007, when it was debunked by Snopes and others. Longevity records kept by the US Geological Survey -- which manages a program than bands wild birds -- show the longest lifespan recorded for a US bald eagle in the wild at 38 years. For golden eagles, the longest was 31 years and eight months. A fact sheet from the US Fish & Wildlife Service says that bald eagles -- the US national bird and a protected species -- generally live 15 to 30 years in the wild. The nonprofit Teton Raptor Center states on its web page that bald eagles may live to over 30 years in the wild and up to 50 years in captivity. Golden eagles -- which according to the organization are more closely related to hawks -- have a similar lifespan. Todd Katzner, a wildlife biologist with USGS who has studied eagles for 25 years and co-edited the book \"The Eagle Watchers,\" told AFP that the social media claim is inaccurate. While eagles' beaks can repair themselves, \"anything more than a minor injury will result in a deformation. Birds absolutely cannot regrow an entire beak,\" Katzner said, adding that a bird without an intact beak \"can't eat normally and probably has to be fed special food. It would die in the wild.\" Eagle talons are comprised of a bony core with a keratin sheath, and \"if the bird loses the bony core, then the keratin won't grow back,\" he said. \"Recovery is possible from a minor injury but not a major one like losing an entire toe/claw.\" Heather Huson, a professor of animal science and director of the Cornell University Raptor Program, also dismissed the claim. \"I've never heard of eagles tearing out their own claws and beaks to extend their lifespan to 70+ years,\" Huson said. \"It just wouldn't make sense as those are two very important parts of adaptation for eagles to eat the things they do and survive.\" Other experts also stated that eagles could not survive the ordeal described in the online posts. \"In order to successfully procure their prey, eagles need their sharp talons and to ingest their catch, they need their sharp pointed beaks to tear food into bite-sized pieces,\" said Lori Arent, assistant director of the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota. \"Without talons and a beak, they simply could not survive.\" Rob Bierregaard, president of the Raptor Research Foundation and a research associate at The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, echoed that assessment. \"They could survive missing a couple of talons (they have 8, after all), but not without a beak,\" he said.",

        "claim": "\"On average, the economy has grown at 3.2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.\"",
        "doc": "'Work opportunity' doesn't mean 'job' Claim \"We have created 3.7-million work opportunities [between April 2009 and March 2014].\" Verdict correct The 2012/13 annual report of the department of public works stated that 3,054,027 \"work opportunities\" were created between April 2009 and March 2013. In the following year another 1,012,664 work opportunities were created. This amounted to a total of 4,066,691 work opportunities created over five years. This was, however, below the target of 4.5-million work opportunities set by the Expanded Public Works Programme for the period. However, a \"work opportunity\" is not a permanent job. A work opportunity is defined as \"paid work created for an individual for any period of time \" as part of South Africa's expanded public works programme. Many \"work opportunities\" last only a few months . For instance, a \"work opportunity\" in the \"infrastructure sector\" lasts an average of four months and six months in the \"environment and culture\" sector. Ideally, these opportunities are meant to equip people with skills that can help them seek further employment. It should be noted that even though 4-million \"work opportunities\" were created it did not mean that 4-million people gained work. If someone was hired for one project and then moved on to another and another, each period of employment would have counted as a single \"work opportunity\". Economic growth slower and lower than others Claim \"On average, the economy has grown at 3.2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.\" Verdict mostly-correct The claim is largely correct, but lacks context. According to the World Bank \"GDP growth in South Africa has averaged 3.2% a year since 1995 \". This was confirmed by Africa's Check's own calculations based on real GDP tables. But while Zuma's numbers were correct, the context was noticeably lacking. Economic growth \u2013 evaluated in terms of real GDP \u2013 has slowed in recent years. In 2012, South Africa's GDP growth fell to 2.5%. Figures released after this speech showed that it was 1.9% in 2013 and is estimated to be 1.4% in 2014 . Rian le Roux, chief economist at Old Mutual, said that to \"overcome the backlog of 20 years of isolation [South Africa] needs to have fast economic growth\". Insufficient growth will not eliminate the backlog of unemployment or drive the creation of new jobs, and means that even where jobs are created they may not be sustainable. This view was supported by a statement from the International Monetary Fund in October 2013 which praised South Africa's strong macroeconomic policies but pointed out that the country's economic performance had been slower and lower than other emerging markets \u2013 and that the growth rate \"creates jobs, but not enough for the growing labo[u]r force and those currently without work\". Unemployment rate higher after recession Claim \"Jobs are now being created again. There are now [in February 2014] 15-million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650,000 jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.\" Verdict misleading According to labour data published by Stats SA early last year, 15,177,000 people were employed in the last quarter of 2013 and 653,000 jobs were created that year. But Zuma's statement was misleading because he focused on the absolute employment numbers and not ratios. He failed to acknowledge that the unemployment rate in South Africa was higher than it was before the global recession. Prior to the recession South Africa's unemployment rate was 21.9%. According to Stats SA, in the last quarter of 2013, 4,830,000 South Africans were classified as unemployed, resulting in an unemployment rate of 24.1%. But Stats SA uses a very narrow definition of \"unemployment\" which refers only people who are unemployed but actively seeking work. An \"expanded rate\" of unemployment \u2013 which includes people who do not have a job and are available to work but have not taken active steps to look for work \u2013 suggests that unemployment levels were as high as 34% in the fourth quarter of that year . The latest available data from the last three months of 2014, released by Stats SA this week, puts narrow unemployment at 24.3% and expanded unemployment at 34.6%.

        "doc": "On 6 October 2016, a rumor raced through social media that Joyce Meyer, a Christian writer and inspirational speaker, had suddenly died after a short illness. The rumor was fueled wholesale by an article from a previously-unknown web site of extremely dubious veracity calledUpdater24: According to the reports, she died a few minutes on arrival at the hospital and details of the cause of her death was not given as her body has now been sent for autopsy. Several world renowned ministers of God have turned on Twitter to express their shock for Joyce\u2019s demise. Joyce Meyer, 73, is a Charismatic Christian author and speaker and president of Joyce Meyer Ministries. Meyer and her husband Dave have four grown children, and live outside St. Louis, Missouri.

However, some of its other articles (with headlines such as \u201cBREAKING: Garden of Eden Discovered in Grenada\u201d, for example) and the lack of bylines, along with entire passages entirely copied and pasted from Wikipedia pages, follow the same pattern as other pages that specialize in hoax news, which generate clicks and in turn, advertising revenue for their owners. (Some also contain malware.) If someone as high profile as Meyer were to suddenly die, the newswould certainly appear on her own web pageor in her hometown newspaper, not an obscure site that has no bylines or contact information, and which appears to only specialize in clickbait and plagiarized content.

        "doc": " A list of purported preventive measures for individuals to take against COVID-19 has been shared thousands of times in multiple posts on Facebook. The posts claim the guidelines were revealed by a \"Chinese doctor\" and helped China to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the recommended practices are misleading; health experts told AFP there is no scientific basis for many of the claims, which include using red-coloured soap and white handkerchiefs, as well as obtaining specific light bulbs. The misleading claims were published on Facebook here on March 16, 2020. The post has been shared more than 17,000 times. Below is a screenshot of the misleading post: The post's lengthy caption, which is written in Sinhala, details a list of instructions that purportedly help control the spread of the novel coronavirus. The new virus has killed more than 8,500 people and infected over 200,000 others worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation. The post also features an image with text translates as: \"This is a valuable article revealed by a Chinese doctor on how China managed to control coronavirus so swiftly..\" ALSO READ: Can Bitter Gourd Help Cure Coronavirus Within Two Hours? Identical posts were also shared on Facebook here, here and here. However, many of the recommendations are misleading. The misleading posts did not cite a specific Chinese doctor or Chinese health authority; a keyword search in Chinese combining \"coronavirus\" and the alleged preventive measures in the posts also found no record of similar advice provided by health practitioners. Light bulbs While highlighting the importance of frequent handwashing, the post urges readers to \"Fix a CFL bulb and keep it lit near taps constructed indoors. It is advisable to use red colored soap or liquid to wash hands\u2026\" While compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) do emit UV light, which can be used at high intensities as a disinfectant, CFL bulbs emit very low levels of UV, as noted by the US Food & Drug Administration here. This makes them safe for daily use and renders them an ineffective disinfectant. Dr. Ashan Pathirana, the registrar of Sri Lanka's Health Promotion Bureau (HPB), also said that installing CFL bulbs near water taps will not provide additional protection. ALSO READ: Can Bathing In Hot Water Prevent COVID-19? \"The installation of a CFL bulb will not help disinfect oneself from the novel coronavirus. There is no scientific basis behind the use of a CFL bulb to kill the novel coronavirus,\" Dr. Pathirana told AFP via phone on March 16. Red Soap Dr. Pathirana also refuted the claim that red-coloured soap is a more effective disinfectant than other types of soaps. \"The red may be in reference to carbolic soap,\" he said. \"But soap or liquid soap nowadays may have a red colour due to a colorant. The advice to seek specifically red coloured soap is counterproductive. The point is to make it a habit to wash one's hands after being in a public location. For general hygiene it is advisable to wash hands with soap at least five times a day.\" ALSO READ: False: Animal Vaccines Prove COVID-19 Is Not A New Viral Disease White Handkerchief The misleading post also claims that the colour white has a \"harmful\" impact on the virus. \"If you can cover with a white handkerchief or tissue when sneezing or coughing, it will prevent the virus in the mucus from being transferred to others..\" the post reads. Dr. Pathirana said: \"It's good to use a tissue when sneezing or coughing but there is no reason to seek out white because colors of the tissue absolutely have no impact on the virus. The only way to ensure the tissue does not end up transferring the virus to others, is to dispose of it safely,\" he added. Coughing etiquette The post also calls for the use of the elbow to cover a cough as the \"angle of the elbow\" will kill viruses faster. \"We ask the public to use the elbow when sneezing or coughing in order to control the spread of droplets. The angle of the elbow has no impact on killing the virus,\" Dr. Pathirana noted.

The caption says, \"15 Homeless people have already been found frozen to death in Chicago,\" and implores users to count their blessings. It's brutally cold in the Midwest and there's no question this record-breakingweather event carries with it extreme danger.So far, there have been eight deaths reportedas the powerful storm hasmovedacross the United States. But there is no evidence for the claim of 15 homeless deaths, and the tragic photo is actually from a 2013 winter event in Canada. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to have originated on Twitter on Jan. 27, a couple of days before the cold blast hit the city. Still, that tweet has been retweeted more than 22,000 times. We found one death reported in the Chicago area and related to the polar vortex, a man was struck and killed by a snowplow. As of Jan. 31, there hadbeen at least seven other reported deaths connected to the extreme cold blast. All are tragic. But none of those deaths were of Chicago\u2019s homeless. And, in fact, they took placeinmultiple states. The fatalities include a couple who died in a car crash on a snowy road in Indiana; a man found in front of his neighbor\u2019s house in Michigan; the body of another man discovered in a Wisconsin garage; and a University of Iowa student found outside in the middle of the night. The accompanying photograph was also not taken in Chicago and is not from this year. In the picture, the homeless person is actually sleeping on a Toronto sidewalk on Jan. 22, 2013, when temperatures dipped to minus-25 degrees. It was featured in the Canadian outlet the National Post. A reverse-image search shows that the photo was later uploaded to other websites starting in February 2013. The city of Chicago took measures to get people off the streets and converted schools, libraries and other buildings into warming centers. As temperatures plunged, one Chicago homeless shelter took in around 800 homeless men, women and children who sought refuge \u2014 surpassing its capacity more than triplefold, according to local news reports. And one anonymous donor offered to pay the hotel bills for roughly 70 homeless people. A social media post says that 15 homeless people died in Chicago from the recent cold snap. While there have been multiple deaths connected to the weather event, none of those, so far, have been reported to be of any homeless persons from the Chicago area. Additionally, the photo of the homeless person featured in the post is six years old and was taken in Canada. We rate it False.",

        "claim": "\"Today, more than 17.1 million Kenyans are covered by the National Hospital Insurance Fund, compared to 4.4 million in 2013.\"",
        "doc": "One claim, about diaspora remittances, is correct. One about cellphone penetration is mostly correct. Kenyatta even understated achievements in funds sent to counties, and access to clean water. Two misleading claims are about the value of remittances and exports, and the \"tripling\" of GDP. A claim about internet penetration is unproven. Four claims are incorrect: about the rise in remittances, the primary to secondary school transition rate, power generation, and health insurance coverage. And two more \u2013 about the Kenyan economy's ranking in Africa, and tax revenue \u2013 are exaggerated. Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta gave his final address on a national holiday as the country marked 59 years of self-rule after colonialism on 1 June 2022. For the first time, Madaraka Day was observed at Nairobi's Uhuru Gardens, historic for the lowering of the Union Jack and the hoisting of the first Kenyan flag in 1963. Kenyatta used the event to highlight his record since being first elected in 2013. His second and final term ends with Kenya's next elections, set for 9 August. In his speech, he made claims about county funding, diaspora remittances, internet and cellular penetration, education, the economy and revenue collection, and more. In this report we examine 13 of his claims. We contacted Kanze Dena-Mararo , the president's spokesperson, and Andrew Wakahiu , who heads the president's delivery unit , for the data used in the claims. We will update this report with their responses. ( Note: We will tackle separate claims about agriculture and roads in upcoming reports. ) Kenya's 2013 election also birthed its 47 counties . Their development has therefore been only under Kenyatta. These units of government had \"forever changed the face of Kenya\", Kenyatta said in his speech, \"buoyed by the KSh2.44 trillion transferred by the national government to the counties\". The counties are funded monthly by the national treasury , a process that involves the office of the controller of budget . Treasury data shows counties received KSh2.44 trillion (about US$20.9 billion at current exchange rates) from March 2013 to 30 June 2021, when the last financial year ended. This appears to back Kenyatta's claim. But the controller of budget has more recent data, which shows that as of December 2021 , KSh2.5 trillion, or close to KSh60 billion more, had been transferred to the counties. Transfers from the national government to Kenyan counties, 2012 to 2022 Financial year Amount (KSh billion) 2012/13 9.7 2013/14 174.4 2014/15 228.5 2015/16 272.1 2016/17 299.7 2017/18 328.9 2018/19 327.8 2019/20 332.7 2020/21 379.9 2021/22 * 144.98 Total 2,498.68 *Half-year report until December 2021 Source: Controller Of Budget reports Further, the president said \"to date\". Newer treasury data shows that KSh261 billion had been sent to the counties by 28 April 2022, taking the total since 2013 to KSh2.7 trillion, or at least KSh250 billion more. This data was published on 13 May and would have been available to his office. We therefore rate the claim as understated. The president missed the chance to claim a higher increase. ( Note: For what these ratings mean, read here .) \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's central bank defines remittances as \"money sent by a person in a foreign land to his or her home country\". The bank keeps a monthly record of these funds, in US dollars. The most recent data is from April 2022. The \"last decade\" for which there's publicly available data is therefore from April 2012 to April 2022. In April 2012, remittances were recorded as $95.6 million . In April 2022, they were at $355 million \u2013 a near four-fold increase, and not the \"10 times\" claimed by Kenyatta . When calendar years are considered, remittances were $891 million in 2011, rising to $3.72 billion in 2021. This is also a four-fold increase. If currency movements are accounted for, the increase between 2011 and 2021 is about five times. One US dollar exchanged at an average of KSh88.81 in 2011, when KSh79.1 billion was sent, and at KSh109.65 in 2021 , when remittances totalled KSh407.9 billion. None of these scenarios show a tenfold rise. We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Dancan Bwire But the president's claim that remittances were at their highest level in 2021 is correct, according to publicly available data. Central bank remittance data goes as far back as 2004. It shows that the highest total was in 2021, when KSh408 billion ($3.72 billion at current rates) was sent home. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Kenya's leadership on regional and international stages had created opportunities for Kenyans, Kenyatta said . Kenya had been key to the Democratic Republic of the Congo joining the East African Community , and the country began a two-year term as a member of the UN Security Council in January 2021 . This \"in return\" had led to the growth in remittances, with their value surpassing that of the country's top traditional exports. But this first happened in 2013 \u2013 the president's first year in office and nine years ago. In 2011, Kenya's top exports were tea, valued at KSh102 billion, and horticulture, worth KSh83 billion. That year, remittances were KSh79.1 billion . This pattern was repeated in 2012. Value of key exports from 2011 to 2015 (KSh bn) Year Horticulture Tea Remittances 2011 83.3 102.2 79.1 2012 81.1 101.4 99 2013 89.3 104.6 111.1 2014 97.1 94 125.6 2015 101 123 152 Source: Economic survey 2015 and 2018 , and the Kenyan central bank \u2013 Dancan Bwire Unesco, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization , defines the transition rate to secondary school as the share of pupils in the final grade of primary school who enrol in the first grade of secondary school the following school year. Kenyatta said his government had raised the transition rate to 100%, but did not give the year this happened. In their final year of primary school, pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education for a chance to join secondary school. Kenya's national statistics bureau publishes transition rates in its annual economic surveys. The most recent survey gives the rate as 78.5% in 2021. It was 91% in 2020, 85.5% in 2019 and 83.1% in 2018. The president made the same claim in his 2019 and 2020 state of the nation addresses. In both instances we found it to be incorrect. The most recent publicly available data shows the transition rate has never reached 100%. Experts have previously told Africa Check that, without a law making secondary school compulsory, achieving the full rate was difficult. Secondary school is also not completely free, keeping some students away. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenyatta attributed this rise to his government's \"massive investment\" in information and communication technology (ICT). Internet penetration refers to the share of the population that uses the internet. Martin Schaaper is a senior analyst at the International Telecommunication Union , the UN agency that focuses on ICT. He directed Africa Check to an ITU dashboard that has the most recent data on penetration. \"We estimate that the internet penetration in Kenya stood at 13% in 2013, rising to 29.5% in 2020,\" Schaaper told Africa Check. He also cited Kenya's 2019 census which showed that only 22.6% of Kenyans had access to the internet. \"We know that in Kenya, the regulator has a formula to estimate internet use based on the number of subscriptions to fixed and mobile broadband subscriptions,\" he said. \"But we believe that that formula is strongly overstating the real number of internet users.\" The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) is responsible for regulating ICT. Other official data is also inconsistent. For instance, the statistics bureau, using CA data, says there were 13.1 million users in Kenya in 2013, but the 2019 census estimate is lower, at 9.9 million . World Bank data shows that internet penetration in Kenya rose from 13% in 2013 to 29.5% in 2020. We asked the communications authority how it calculates the rate. Director-general Ezra Chiloba directed us to one of his officers for details. We will update this report when we hear back. Until then we rate the claim as unproven . \u2013 Dancan Bwire Martin Schaaper, the ITU analyst, told Africa Check the available data indicated that there were 70 mobile phone subscriptions for every 100 people in 2013. For 2020, the ITU's digital development dashboard puts the number at 114 subscriptions per 100 people. In 2021, Schaaper said, there were 118 subscriptions per 100 people. The agency did not have 2022 data yet, he said. It will only be available next year. The most recent publicly available data from the national statistics office puts the mobile phone penetration rate at 131.88 subscriptions per 100 people, an increase from 74.9 per 100 people \u2013 or 74.9% \u2013 in 2013. As the ITU gets its data from Kenya's communications authority , we rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Dancan Bwire John Kinuthia , a senior programmes officer at the International Budget Partnership 's Kenya office, said we should look at GDP data from the Kenya national bureau of statistics to evaluate this claim . The partnership is a think tank focused on budget transparency. For comparative data, he directed us to check with international institutions such as the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank . Gross domestic product (GDP) is a widely used measure of the size of a country's economy. It is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. World Bank data puts the value of Kenya's economy at $61.7 billion in 2013, ranking it ninth on the continent. The most recent GDP data, for 2020, values it at $101 billion and places Kenya seventh \u2013 not sixth. Rank Country 2020 GDP (current US$ bn) 1 Nigeria 432.29 2 Egypt 365.25 3 South Africa 335.44 4 Algeria 145.01 5 Morocco 114.73 6 Ethiopia 107.65 7 Kenya 101.01 8 Ghana 68.53 9 Tanzania 62.41 Source: World Bank We rate this claim as exaggerated. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Kenyatta has made the claim about tripling the economy before , as has his finance minister Ukur Yatani. We found both claims to be wrong. Official data valued Kenya's economy at KSh4.7 trillion in 2013. The World Bank had a slightly higher figure of KSh5.31 trillion. The most recent economic survey data estimates the country's GDP at KSh12.1 trillion in 2021. The treasury and finance minister expect GDP to be KSh12.6 trillion in 2022. But experts have previously told us that this claim leaves out important context. This is that the Kenyan economy was rebased in 2014 and 2021 , and that there have been significant price changes since 2013.  Public debt has also risen sharply under the Kenyatta administration. Higher GDP doesn't mean everyone is better off The gist of Kenyatta's much repeated claim is that everyone is significantly better off. But Margarida Domingues de Carvalho, who works with Eurostat , the European Union 's statistical office, has previously told Africa Check there were problems with using GDP to show gains. \"GDP is often misinterpreted as a measure of societal progress and well-being, which it is not,\" she said in an email. \"GDP and GDP growth only give indications on the size and dynamics of an economy, but say nothing about, for example, the distribution of income and wealth or possible adverse environmental effects of the economic activity.\" While Kenyatta's numbers are broadly correct, the way he uses them leaves out key context and tells an incomplete story. We rate this claim as misleading. \u2013Makinia Juma. Kenyatta said the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) was \"on course to achieve the record-shattering projection of KSh2 trillion by the end of the current financial year\". KRA records show that it collected KSh800.5 billion in the 2012/13 financial year. Treasury data as reported by the national statistics office gave a slightly lower figure of KSh763 million. The treasury publishes monthly data of actual revenue collected. The most recent shows that as of 28 April, total tax and non-tax revenue was KSh1.51 trillion, about KSh90 billion less than the president's figure. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's data agency regularly publishes power generation figures, sourced from the electricity utility Kenya Power and power-generating company KenGen . In 2013, total power generation, including imports, was 8,447 GWh (gigawatt hours). The most recent economic survey shows 12,414 GWh in 2021. The increase is about 1.5 times, not 40 times as the president claimed. We also found the installed capacity had risen from 1,717 MW (megawatts) in 2013 to a provisional figure of 2,989.6 MW in 2021. Kenya Power has 1,765 MW as of June 2013 and 2,984 MW in June 2021. Installed capacity is the maximum capacity that the electricity system is designed to run at. This would mean power capacity grew by about 1.7 times in the last nine years. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. \u2013 Tess Wandia The Water Services Regulatory Board provides data on water access. By law, the regulator is required to keep a national database of water services and report on water and sanitation every year. Its most recent report covers the 2019/20 financial year. This shows that 14.7 million people had access to water from water service providers. The president understated the figure by 1.7 million people and again missed a chance to claim even more progress. But the larger picture is worrying, with water coverage falling from 59% in 2018/19 to 57% in 2019/20. This only covers the utilities it regulates and was due to population growth, the board said. \u2013 Tess Wandia The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) provides medical insurance to its members. Payments to the fund are deducted from all Kenyans in formal employment. Kenyans in the informal sector pay at least KSh6,000 a year for fund membership. Kenyatta's written speech , on the presidency's website, claims that his government \"registered a 400% growth in the number of Kenyans insured under NHIF\" from 2013 to date. But when he read his speech he left out the percentage increase, dwelling only on the numbers \u2013 the rise in NHIF coverage from 4.4 million to 17.1 million. The fund provides membership returns to the national data agency. In 2012/13, Kenyatta's first year in office, the fund had 3.8 million members. The most recent report shows the fund has 10.1 million members, and 13.3 million dependents, that is, a declared spouse or child. The principal membership has increased by 166%, not 400% as claimed. And the number of Kenyans insured \u2013 principal members plus their dependents \u2013 is 23 million, not 17.1 million . We therefore rate this claim as incorrect.",

        "doc": "A picture of Swamy Vivekananda has recently gone viral on social media showing him in action while bowling a cricket ball in what looks like a domestic league cricket match. The photo claims that Swamiji played for the Calcutta Town Club in 1884. Many people have shared this post on Facebook and those posts have gotten many likes and made the post go viral. Here are some screenshots of the said post. Similar posts have also gone viral on Twitter, as can be seen below. This is one of the rarest pics in my possession\u2026 Year : 1884 Venue : Eden Gardens While playing for Calcutta Town Club, the one who is seen bowling here in the pic is none other than Narendra Nath Dutta, popularly known as Swami Vivekananda\u2026#Collected Seen or unseen? pic.twitter.com/ouCShBFbRY \u2014 SAIJI's nabanita \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83e\ude94 (@nabanita_1994) November 29, 2021 Archived Tweets can bee seen here and here. Fact check / Verification To verify the claim we started with a Google keyword search to find out if Swamy Vivekananda had played cricket in 1884 on behalf of the Calcutta Town Club. Our search revealed that in 1880, there was a match between Calcutta Cricket Club and Town Club in which Narendranath Dutt took six wickets. And this Narendra Nath was none other than the world famous Swamiji. We also found out that Swamiji was an ardent football fan and played the game well. He took part in both cricket and football matches, and also encouraged his friends to take part in the sport. A report published during this period, before Swamiji\u2019s birth anniversary in 2013, states that the club with which he used to play football and cricket at a time when Swamy Vivekananda\u2019s birthday was being celebrated in the state was neglected. Although there is no detailed evidence, there is some evidence in Shankari Basu\u2019s \u2018Sahasya Vivekananda\u2019 which points towards Swamiji\u2019s relationship with sports. Screenshot of New Indian Express\u2019 report Newschecker proceeded to conduct a reverse image search to find out if the picture of Swamiji which went viral on social media is in fact authentic. We found links of Getty Images and Cricket Country from where the picture was taken, although the image does not show Swamiji but rather the famous England bowler Hedley Verity. Verity played for England and Yorkshire from 1930 to 1939. Screenshot of the image on Getty Images Headley was known as a slow left-arm bowler in the archives of Variety Cricket. He fought not only on the cricket field, but also against Germany in 1943, and died in Sicily. Newschecker also debunked the claim in Bangla, you can read our fact-check here. Conclusion Our observations show that the image that went viral on social media claiming to show Swamy Vivekananda playing on behalf of the Calcutta Town Club in 1884, was in fact an edited image of the England and Yorkshire left-arm bowler Headley Variety.

        "claim": "In 2019, city officials in Portland, Oregon, announced or implemented a prohibition on urinals in public buildings in the city.",
        "doc": "We received multiple inquiries from readers in September 2019 about the accuracy of reports that claimed officials in Portland, Oregon, had decided to \u201cban urinals\u201d from public buildings in the city. On Sept. 25, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted an article with the headline \u201cPortland Bans Urinals in Public Buildings \u2014 Out of Respect to the City\u2019s \u2018Shared Values,'\u201d which reported that: \u201cThe city of Portland (where else) is now banning urinals in city-owned buildings and spending taxpayer money to remove them. The first urinal-free building is appropriately called The Portland Building, where countless paper-shuffling city bureaucrats congregate to waste oxygen and demand pay raises.\u201d That post cited an earlier article by local television channel KGW8, which reported that: The City of Portland banned urinals in the remodeled Portland Building. Urinals, for those who have never been in a men\u2019s bathroom, are porcelain receptors without seats or lids that allow men to quickly relieve themselves \u2026 In an email to employees last February, Chief Administrative Officer Tom Rinehart wrote: \u201cWe will continue to have gender-specific (male and female) multi-stall restrooms that are readily available to any employee that prefers to use one. But, there will be no urinals in any restroom in the building. This will give us the flexibility we need for any future changes in signage.\u201d The city has redesigned all the bathrooms to be gender neutral \u2014 which means urinals are banned [even] in the men\u2019s room. KGW8 also claimed, in its headline, that urinals had been \u201cbanned\u201d from the Portland Building, though, unlike The Gateway Pundit, it did not claim the purported ban extended to all public buildings in the city. Portland city officials have indeed decided not to install urinals in any bathrooms in the Portland Building, which was under renovation as of September 2019. However, The Gateway Pundit\u2019s article was misleading and illogical in characterizing that decision as a \u201cban\u201d and also inaccurate in claiming that the urinal policy applied to all public buildings (or even more than one) in the city. A spokesperson for the city\u2019s Office of Management and Finance and the Portland Building reconstruction project confirmed to Snopes in an email that officials \u201cchose not to install urinals when the restrooms were remodeled,\u201d and provided a graphic that showed the expected layout of bathrooms in the building, including female, male and \u201call-user\u201d (gender-neutral) bathrooms. The absence of urinals in either male or all-user bathrooms, the spokesperson explained, meant that \u201cin the future, we have the ability to move to all-user restrooms on additional floors.\u201d In his email to employees in February 2019, Portland\u2019s Chief Administrative officer Tom Rinehart explained that all of the bathrooms had also been designed to be identical to one another, meaning that if officials later chose to convert some gender-specific bathrooms to gender-neutral status, that switch could more easily be made. That email, and the plan in question, related only to the Portland Building, meaning The Gateway Pundit\u2019s headline claim \u2014 that the city had \u201cbanned urinals from public buildings\u201d \u2014 was false. Rather, the spokesperson told us: \u201cIt is possible that, in future remodels of other city buildings, urinals may not be installed if restrooms are renovated. There are no plans to remove urinals as a separate project.\u201d The description of the Portland Building urinal policy as a \u201cban\u201d on urinals \u2014 as claimed by both The Gateway Pundit and KGW8 \u2014 was illogical and grossly misleading. The city itself owns and manages the building and is responsible for overseeing its renovation. Rather, the city has made a design choice in order to facilitate potential future changes to the gender status of bathrooms in the building. For the foregoing reasons, we issue a rating of \u201cMostly False.\u201d",

        "claim": "Says an EPA permit \"languished\" under Strickland but his new EPA director got it done in two days.",
        "doc": "Gov. John Kasich wanted to make a splash.The swashbuckling Ohio governor wanted to show Ohio\u2019s business community he was serious about his vow to speed up the permitting process at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.Kasich found just such an opportunity when an air pollution permit for an Eastern Ohio energy company, Mingo Junction Energy Center (MJEC), was granted during his first week in office.At a news conference on his fifth day in office, the Republican governor described the air permit as having \"languished\" under the previous administration and was incredulous that EPA officials had \"held the darn thing up for over 20 months.\"Kasich implied that EPA paper-pushers had been negligent. \"It\u2019s just bureaucracy. It\u2019s a lack of commitment and a lack of vision.\"Kasich praised his new EPA director, Scott Nally, for acting quickly to get the permit issued. \"This is a fact \u2014 it was over 20 months they couldn\u2019t get an agreement, he did it in 48 hours,\" Kasich boasted.PolitiFact Ohio found that claim startling \u2014 and just the kind of thing to assess.We contacted Chris Abbruzzese, the EPA\u2019s director of communications, who said the governor\u2019s characterization was accurate because no agreement had been reached under former Gov. Ted Strickland and in a \"48-hour window\" Nally had managed to work out a deal. He did note that the Strickland administration spent 19 months on the permit, rather than 20, as the governor said.Abbruzzese said Nally asked Bob Hodanbosi, chief of the Division of Air Pollution Control, top permit writer Mike Hopkins and other staffers to tackle 27 technical issues that remained on the permit request. They whittled that down to just a pair of issues by the close of the business day on Jan 12.During an hour-long call on the morning of Jan 13, Nally, Hodanbosi, Hopkins and the company\u2019s lawyer Ken Komoroski were able to sort out those last two issues. All that was left that night was for staff attorneys for each side to \"trade documents and get the final language in place,\" according to Abbruzzese.Next, we looked at what was accomplished on the project under Strickland. An internal memo from Hodanbosi to Nally on Jan. 12 told us that a draft permit was issued in November 2010 following more than 35 weekly conference calls and meetings with the company. The discussions and joint development of the permit by EPA staff and the company concerned exactly how to allow the company to burn coke-oven gas from a steel-making process instead of \"flaring it off\" into the atmosphere.After receiving comments from the company during the 30-day draft period that lasted until mid-December 2010, the EPA \"revised the final permit twice to try and address their concerns and was ready to issue the final permit\" during Strickland\u2019s last week in office, Hodanbosi wrote.But the company balked at some of the language in the permit, so it wasn\u2019t issued while Strickland was in office. \"The company responded on Jan. 7, 2011, that they did not want the permit issued as written,\" reads the memo.Chris Korleski, who preceded Nally as head of the state EPA under Strickland, said the project was \"almost finished\" and required only a few tweaks.\"The vast bulk of a tremendous amount of work was done already when I left,\" Korleski. The former director said that Kasich had unfairly portrayed his team as indifferent bureaucrats.\"This was not a poster child for anything wrong that Ohio EPA did,\" Korleski said. \"The staff bent over backwards to the point of rushing two sets of orders allowing them to keep operating in the absence of the permit.\"He added: \"They got it worked out on a phone call in an hour? That tells me the issues weren\u2019t terribly complex or terribly difficult.\"Bob Smith, a Maryland attorney and partner with Venable LLP who has three decades of experience working on air pollution permits including some for steel plants and co-generation facilities, had a similar view.Speaking in general terms, Smith said typically you are \"very close\" to issuing the final permit once the draft permit has been issued, particularly when there aren't any comments (as was the case here) from the public or outside parties to consider.Smith said having the permit applicant request changes of a draft permit is pretty standard.\"Those kinds of requests are not at all uncommon,\" he said. \"It can take agency personnel a bit of time to digest them,\" he said. He said normally it would take a few weeks or a month to wrap up the process.Any changes during a final 48-hour period would be \"last-minute fine-tuning to make sure the permit was appropriately clear,\" he said. \"It's a process that only happens at the end of a very long process. A longer time period (than 48 hours) would have been required to deal with the bigger issues.\"So to sum up, there is a sliver of truth to what Kasich said, as more than 19 months had elapsed with no final agreement in place. And the finishing touches to the permit were clearly put on the project by staff being pushed by Nally in the two-day time frame. But, given the work that was done during those 19 months, and that the company was the roadblock to the permit being completed while Strickland was still governor, Kasich\u2019s complaint of a \"lack of commitment\" from staffers as the reason for the project taking so long doesn\u2019t ring true.And, Kasich\u2019s contention at the news conference that \"they couldn\u2019t get an agreement\" for 20 months that Nally got in 48 hours is an oversimplification, particularly since a draft permit was issued in mid-November, and state officials were ready to issue a final permit while Strickland was still in office.Those are critical facts that would give the listener a different impression of the governor\u2019s statement. That\u2019s why we rate Kasich\u2019s claim to be Barely True.",

BOOM had found that none of Rafi's daughters are named Mustafa Parvez. Fact Check Several users called out netizens for misidentifying the singer as Kishore Kumar's granddaughter and identified her as Ananya Sabnis, a Mumbai-based singer. We then looked up Sabnis on Facebook and found her social media pages. According to the description on Sabnis' official page, she is a professional stage artist. The same video has been shared from her Facebook page and has garnered more than 4 lakh views. BOOM reached out to Sabnis' music teacher, Usha Timothy, who further identified her as Ananya Sabnis. Timothy said, \"Ananya is my student. She has been taking music lessons from me for the past five to six years. She is still in school and is known for her beautiful voice in the music fraternity in Mumbai.\" We also reached out Sabnis' mother Manisha Mainkar Sabnis, who corroborated the same.

        "claim": "Says as a result of the national health care reform, \"the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care.\"",
        "doc": "It didn\u2019t take long after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the health care reform law for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to revive a questionable talking point about the potential savings from the legislation.In the hours following the court decision, the Democratic senator claimed health care reform policies will lower the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next 20 years.\"So the reality is the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care,\" Menendez said in a June 28 interview on the Regional News Network\u2019s Richard French Live.Menendez is correct in his overall point that budget office projections indicate health care reform policies will likely lower federal deficits. But the senator made a couple of mistakes in citing those specific figures, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Our PolitiFact colleagues debunked similar claims by other Democrats in 2010, including one from President Barack Obama.First, let\u2019s discuss the projected deficit reduction in the first decade.The Affordable Care Act and related legislation contain various provisions that affect federal spending in three ways: some policies increase costs; some policies reduce spending; and others generate additional revenues.For the 2012-2021 period, the budget office has projected that there will be more new revenue than new spending, resulting in a net decrease in federal deficits of $210 billion, according to a February 2011 estimate. As of March of this year, that estimate had not been updated.So, the senator is clearly wrong to cite projected savings of \"$250 million over the first 10 years.\"But Menendez made a larger mistake by suggesting the budget office has projected \"$1.2 trillion in savings\" over the second 10 years.The budget office has not projected any specific dollar figures for that period. The uncertainties are too substantial to create such detailed projections, according to the budget office.The \"$1.2 trillion\" cited by Menendez is based on the budget office\u2019s estimate that health care reform policies would reduce deficits in that second decade by \"an amount in a broad range around one-half percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\" GDP is a measure of the nation's economy.However, in multiple reports over the last few years, the budget office has cautioned that this long-term estimate carries a \"greater degree of uncertainty.\" That's why a specific dollar figure has not been projected.In a December 2009 report, the budget office said: \"A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great.\"As the budget office noted in a February 2011 report, calculations for the second decade are based on the assumption that existing provisions remain unchanged, but a number of policies may not be sustainable over a long period of time.\"Over a longer time span, a wide range of changes could occur\u2014in people\u2019s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care\u2014that are very difficult to predict but that could have a significant effect on federal health care spending,\" according to that report.So, Menendez\u2019s \"$1.2 trillion in savings\" is not based on an exact dollar figure projected by the budget office, but instead on a percentage of GDP, a rough estimate with a \"greater degree of uncertainty\" attached to it.In response to our findings, Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said in an e-mail:\"CBO was asked by members of Congress to provide the out-year estimates for the health care law and that\u2019s what they did. They said their best estimate was .5% of GDP. If you take that estimate and plug in the numbers so that it\u2019s actually easier to understand, you get approximately $1 trillion. That\u2019s the estimate the Senator has used and it\u2019s the same estimate used by the President\u2019s economic team. It\u2019s the estimate he will continue to use.\"Our rulingIn a TV interview, Menendez claimed that, as a result of the national health care reform, \"the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care.\"The senator\u2019s claims contain an element of truth, which is that the budget office has projected health care reform policies will likely lower federal deficits. But Menendez fumbled by citing those specific figures.Over the first 10 years, the budget office is projecting a reduction of $210 billion, not the \"$250 million\" cited by Menendez.As for whether there will be \"$1.2 trillion in savings\" in the second 10 years, the budget office has not projected any specific dollar figure for that period. Instead, Menendez\u2019s claim is based on a percentage of GDP that's considered by the budget office to be a rough estimate with a \"greater degree of uncertainty.\"We rate the statement Mostly False.

No such court order has been handed down, and a photograph which the article claims shows \u201cMolly Sanders\u201d and her eight-year-old son \u201cTommy\u201d is, in fact, a stock photograph that can be found ontwo web sites with the description \u201cStock photo of young Caucasian mother with bi-racial 8 year old son smiling.\u201d In 2010, a Florida sex worker known as Devon James filed a paternity lawsuit against Woods, claiming he was the father of her then nine-year-old son. In reality, a 2002 DNA test had already established that another man was the boy\u2019s father, and James\u2019 lawsuit was dismissed, according to Inside Edition. Woods has publicly admitted to multiple instances of infidelity to his former wife Elin Nordegren, and has undergone treatment for sex addiction.

        "claim": "Seven children in Senegal died after being administered a COVID-19 coronavirus disease vaccine in April 2020.",
        "doc": " Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we\u2019ve learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines.

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In April 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media holding that seven children in Senegal had died after being administered a COVID-19 coronavirus disease vaccine. There is no truth to this rumor. Seven children did not die in Senegal in April 2020 after they were administered a vaccine for COVID-19. A spokeswoman for Senegal\u2019s health ministry told the AFP news site that these claims were \u201cfake news.\u201d The spokesperson said: \u201cThere is no vaccine \u2026 We have medical experts at the Institut Pasteur (a medical research institute, editor\u2019s note) in Dakar working to create and certify a vaccine according to procedure. They will be completely transparent about their findings.\u201d This rumor was largely based on a piece of footage from March that showed a somewhat chaotic scene in Senegal. One version of the video that was widely circulated on social media contained narration from a man speaking in French. In that video, the narrator says: \u201cThere is a big scandal in Senegal. There is a guy who came into a house to get kids vaccinated for coronavirus. He vaccinated seven children who died on the spot.\u201d However, this is not the original audio that accompanied this footage. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 found a version of the video in Wolof, the most common language in Senegal, and found that while the Wolof narration also mentioned a COVID-19 vaccine, the claim about seven dead children was absent. In the Wolof version, the narrator says: \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who came to the neighborhood today with injections supposedly against the coronavirus. He entered the house of the Mbodji family. He said he is there to administer vaccines. The family members told him that this is not true. He fled to go to the neighborhood chief. He was finally neutralized right here with the neighborhood chief. We are currently there and the gendarmerie is there too. Everyone is there for that \u201d. This version of events matches up with news stories from local Senegal publications. On March 26, the website Senego reported that two people were arrested in the country after they claimed to have a vaccine for COVID-19. The AFP confirmed with local police that a man (not two men) was briefly arrested. However, this incident appears to have been the result of a misunderstanding. The man was apparently selling cosmetics door-to-door, but he was also wearing a health ministry T-shirt. When the word \u201ccoronavirus\u201d was mentioned, people started to panic, thinking that he was there to forcibly administer vaccines. A spokeswoman for the Senegal health ministry told the AFP: \u201cHe never wanted to vaccinate people. He was passing by a house, and the resident\u2019s aunt started causing panic when she heard the word \u2018coronavirus\u2019. A crowd of people gathered outside, thinking this man wanted to vaccinate people by force.\u201d A spokesperson for the armed forces ministry said that no medical equipment was found at the scene, adding: \u201cThere was just one man who was a Senegalese national selling cosmetics door to door \u2026 During the discussion, a member of the family asked him if he had any vaccines. He jokingly replied that he did. The aunt rounded up the whole neighbourhood. Officers attended and found only cosmetic products in the man\u2019s bag. The drama was caused by the fact he was wearing a health ministry t-shirt.\u201d France 24 managed to contact the woman living in the house where this fiasco took place. Alassane Mbodji told the news outlet that \u201ceverything that is said on social networks is false. No one died of any vaccine. Our children are healthy.\u201d Mbodji explained: About two weeks ago, a man came home around noon. He introduced himself as an agent of the Ministry of Health who came to raise awareness about the threat of coronavirus and the precautions to be taken to avoid it, such as regular hand washing. He had worn a t-shirt flanked by a logo from the Department of Health. But in the discussions, we quickly realized that he was not an agent of the Ministry of Health. He did not have a badge. He had cosmetic products for sale in his bag. Outside people are prohibited from entering homes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But this person pretended to be a public agent to be able to sell his articles. So we sent him back to the neighborhood chief. And from there, the gendarmerie took him. To sum up: The claim that seven children died after being administered a vaccine for COVID-19 is false. This rumor is largely based on video showing a somewhat chaotic scene in Senegal involving a door-to-door salesman, a health ministry T-shirt, and growing concern about the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "doc": "A bizarre video supposedly showing two \u201cmonster fish\u201d passing an eel from one\u2019s mouth to the other was widely circulated on social media in the spring of 2021. Viewers be warned, the following video is weird, possibly disturbing, and just all around gross. This video does not showcase a natural occurrence. There is no species of fish that we are aware of that lives in the sand and occasionally regurgitates eels for its monster fish buddies to eat. This video comes from the India-based YouTube channel Discovery Site. The original video is entitled \u201cUnderground Monster hunting eelfish. Big fish swallowing mudeel. Big fish vomiting eel to big fish.\u201d This channel is replete with similarly absurd videos that showcase various \u201cfishing techniques,\u201d and other seemingly odd fish behaviors. In another video, for example, a group of land-dwelling fish emerge from their holes to visit a watering hole. In another video, raw egg is used to coax \u201cclimbing perch\u201d out of their holes. These videos do not document genuine natural occurrences. These are all staged videos that seemingly use dead fish as their main props. Many of these videos are accompanied with a disclaimer, stating that these videos are for \u201centertainment purposes only\u201d and do not reflect reality. While these videos may be bizarre, they are undoubtedly popular. Since its inception in August 2020, the Discovery Site YouTube page has racked up more than 100 million views. And the Discovery Site is not the only YouTube channel that makes these oddly staged fish videos. Fisherman Animal Lover is another page (with more than 1 million subscribers) that creates similar content. A since-deleted YouTube page called Technique Tools scored a viral hit back in 2019 with a video supposedly showing fish being driven out of a hole with Coca-Cola and Mentos. This video, too, was just a hoax. In short, the video of \u201cmonster fish\u201d exchanging an eel meal is a staged piece of footage that most likely uses dead animals.",

        "doc": "CLAIM Monkeypox is caused by COVID-19 vaccines; a 2021 tabletop exercise portraying a monkeypox pandemic is evidence that global leaders planned the outbreak; the monkeypox vaccine was \u201cready\u201d before the outbreak more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Social media users, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, 13 May 2022 DETAILS Incorrect: COVID-19 vaccines can\u2019t cause monkeypox because none of them contain the monkeypox virus. Furthermore, adenoviruses and pox viruses are different families of viruses and cause different diseases. The adenoviral vectors used in some vaccines are unable to cause an infection in humans. Inadequate support: A tabletop exercise simulating a monkeypox pandemic from March 2021 doesn\u2019t provide evidence that the monkeypox outbreak was planned. The virus was selected for its known pandemic risk. KEY TAKE AWAY Several countries in Europe, America, and Asia are reporting cases of monkeypox cases in people with no recent travel history to regions where the disease is endemic, that is, limited regions in Central and West Africa where the virus circulates. While the spread of monkeypox in non-endemic countries is unusual and concerning, the cases detected so far are less likely to cause a pandemic like SARS-CoV-2 did. The main reasons are that the number of cases is low, the virus doesn\u2019t spread as easily as SARS-CoV-2, and we already have a vaccine, the smallpox vaccine, that protects against monkeypox. FULL CLAIM: \u201dYou literally let them inject you with a genetically modified chimpanzee adenovirus, that inserts foreign RNA into your cells, then you wonder where the monkeypox came from!\u201d; a 2021 tabletop exercise portraying a monkeypox pandemic is evidence that global leaders planned the monkeypox outbreak; the monkeypox vaccine was \u201cready\u201d before the outbreak REVIEW On 13 May 2022, the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of two confirmed cases of monkeypox in patients from the same household and without recent travel history to areas where the virus circulates. Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus. This genus also includes the variola virus that caused the now-eradicated smallpox. Monkeypox causes symptoms similar to smallpox but typically milder. The monkeypox virus is endemic in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This means that the virus generally circulates only in these geographic areas. In contrast, transmission in non-endemic countries is very rare. While occasional cases of monkeypox have occurred outside of Africa, they are generally linked to international travel or imported animals. On 15 May 2022, the WHO issued a multi-country alert about an increase in cases of monkeypox in non-endemic areas. As of 21 May 2022, the organization has recorded 92 laboratory-confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox in nine European countries and in the U.S., Canada, and Australia. These unusual cases of monkeypox triggered conspiratorial claims on social media, with some going particularly viral, like a YouTube video by musician An0maly. Some claimed that the outbreak was planned, as happened with COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Other claims suggested that the monkeypox cases were caused by the adenoviral vector used in some COVID-19 vaccines, or that the outbreak is a hoax. Below, we analyze each of these claims and explain why they are incorrect, misleading, and unsubstantiated by scientific evidence. Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, transmitted from animals to humans; there is no evidence of any link with COVID-19 vaccines Following the monkeypox outbreak, multiple theories about its origin spread on social media. One Facebook post claimed that the virus \u201cwas created in a lab and given via injection\u201d. The post based the claim on the fact that monkeypox was first identified in 1958 in colonies of macaques kept in a facility in Copenhagen, Denmark. However, this claim is incorrect. Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, which means that it is caused by a naturally occurring virus that jumped from animals to humans. Many animal species, including rodents and non-human primates, are susceptible to infection with the monkeypox virus. According to later studies, the monkeypox virus isolated from the macaques in Denmark likely originated in West Africa and naturally infected the macaques. There are also no signs of engineering in the virus that caused the recent cases of monkeypox; the WHO reported that all cases confirmed to date involve known variants from West Africa. Other posts suggested that the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine might be behind the monkeypox cases because it contains a chimpanzee adenovirus vector (examples here, here, here, and here). During an episode of his show, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones made similar claims that the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cvirus vectors that inject the genome of a chimpanzee into your cells\u201d. These claims are incorrect and unsubstantiated by scientific evidence. To begin with, the claim that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenoviral vector is inaccurate. Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines use adenoviral vectors, which are harmless modified versions of an adenovirus that carry the genetic instructions for producing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the cells. However, the adenoviral vector in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is based on the human adenovirus type 26 that causes mild cold symptoms and pink eye in humans[1]. The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine does use a chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1)[2]. However, adenoviruses are a family of viruses different from the pox viruses to which the monkeypox belongs, and don\u2019t cause pox-like illnesses but respiratory infections. The adenovirus used in the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is responsible for causing the common cold in chimpanzees. The adenoviral vector is also not produced in monkeys but in human cells grown in a Petri dish. Furthermore, the virus vectors used in these vaccines cannot cause disease, because they are modified to be replication-deficient. That means that the vectors used in the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines cannot multiply and infect humans. In other words, none of the COVID-19 vaccines contain the monkeypox virus, no part of their production process involves monkeys, and the adenoviral vectors they use can\u2019t multiply to cause an infection. Therefore, there is no plausible mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines could trigger a monkeypox outbreak. Pandemic simulations help improve response to future outbreaks; the fact that an outbreak with similar characteristics eventually occurs isn\u2019t evidence that it was planned In March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Munich Security Conference jointly held a pandemic simulation exercise. The exercise scenario portrayed a \u201cdeadly, global pandemic involving an unusual strain of monkeypox virus\u201d engineered in a laboratory and released in the fictional country of Brinia on 15 May 2022 due to a terrorist attack. At the end of the exercise, the virus caused \u201cmore than three billion cases and 270 million fatalities worldwide\u201d. The similarity between this scenario and the first real cases of monkeypox notified in the U.K. on 13 May 2022 triggered conspiracy theories about the outbreak being planned or the monkeypox virus deliberately released. One example is a video published by a musician who goes by the alias An0maly and has more than one and a half million followers on Facebook and over 250,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel. An0maly, who spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines in the past, suggested a link between the monkeypox simulation and previous conspiracy theories about world depopulation. Specifically, he compared the monkeypox exercise with a 2019 simulation of a coronavirus pandemic and claimed, \u201cthey came together, they planned their response of [sic] a coronavirus pandemic, and then six months later they really rolled out the plan\u201d. In a reference to Bill Gates and co-founder of the NTI Ted Turner, An0maly said, \u201cthey don\u2019t want to hurt you, it\u2019s just they think there\u2019s too many people on the planet and they want less people over time\u201d. Another video was published by someone who goes by the alias Amazing Polly. An article in The Conversation described this person as a \u201cQAnon influencer\u201d who was allegedly responsible for spreading the conspiracy theory that the furniture retail company Wayfair was selling children on its website. Amazing Polly stated that the similarities between the pandemic exercise and the real monkeypox outbreak are \u201ca bit too coincidental\u201d. She added that \u201cthis monkeypox thing is just a reiteration of what they have done in the past with anthrax, with coronavirus, and now with monkeypox\u201d and it is \u201cmeant to terrorize people into getting vaccines\u201d for the economic profit of some. Both videos linked the 2021 simulation exercise to debunked conspiracy theory claiming that Event 201, another exercise simulating a pandemic caused by a coronavirus and held in New York in October 2019, was evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. However, available evidence doesn\u2019t support any of these claims. On 24 May 2022, the NTI issued a statement explaining that \u201c[t]he fact that several countries are currently experiencing an outbreak of monkeypox is purely a coincidence\u201d. The organization stated that \u201c[t]he risks posed by monkeypox have been well documented for years\u201d[3]. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists monkeypox on the U.S. Select Agents and Toxins List that includes biological agents and toxins with potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health. In fact, pandemic preparedness exercises are common in many countries. An0maly presented with suspicion the fact that \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful people come to these simulations and really kind of plan everything that they would do if a pandemic came, like a coronavirus or monkeypox\u201d. However, that is precisely the objective of these simulations: to raise awareness about potential biological threats and help to improve responses in case a real pandemic occurs. Likewise, the objective of the NTI simulation exercise was to identify \u201cgaps in national and international biosecurity and pandemic preparedness\u201d. In fact, the NTI and the Munich Security Conference organize similar outbreak simulations annually involving threats such as a pneumonic plague (2019), an influenza virus (2020), and the Akhmeta virus (2022), a cowpox virus identified in 2012 that belongs to the same genus as the monkeypox virus. The NTI further pointed out that the exercise scenario involved a massive release of an engineered monkeypox virus that was very lethal and vaccine-resistant. In contrast, monkeypox is less likely to cause a pandemic in the current circumstances, where there is a low number of cases caused by a known natural virus that causes mild disease and for which vaccines are effective. The NTI also clarified that \u201c[w]e have no reason to believe that the current outbreak involves an engineered pathogen, as we have not seen any compelling evidence that would support such a hypothesis.\u201d As we explained above, the WHO stated that all cases whose samples were confirmed by PCR involved the known West African strain of the monkeypox virus. In fact, the genome sequences were very similar to cases of monkeypox exported from Nigeria to the U.K., Israel, and Singapore in 2018 and 2019, evidence that indicates the virus is naturally-occurring. In short, these pandemic preparedness exercises aren\u2019t evidence of an orchestrated disease outbreak. Instead, they aim to improve global response to pandemics. The coincidental choice of the monkeypox virus for the pandemic exercise is justified by its potential to cause outbreaks. The rapid availability of smallpox vaccines is due to the continuous production for emergency stockpiling Amazing Polly and others (examples here and here) insinuated that the monkeypox outbreak was released or planned to profit economically by selling vaccines against it. Most of them mentioned Jynneos, a smallpox vaccine that also prevents monkeypox and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for adults \u201cat high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection\u201d in September 2019. While some posts incorrectly claimed that the vaccine is from Pfizer, it is the Dutch biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic that produces the vaccine. The company recently announced that the U.S. had ordered 13 million doses of Jynneos, which some saw as evidence that monkeypox was planned in order to sell the vaccine. However, this claim is incorrect and unsupported. In a news release, Bavarian Nordic explained that the order was part of a contract with the U.S. government that started in 2003 with the objective of increasing the national stockpile of smallpox vaccines.The U.S. and the WHO have been stockpiling emergency smallpox vaccines for years. Although vaccination stopped following smallpox eradication, public health authorities recognized the necessity of keeping an emergency reserve that would allow them to respond quickly in the case of a natural re-emergence of smallpox or a biological attack. But the original smallpox vaccine was a live vaccine with many contraindications. That is why the U.S. FDA approved Jynneos, a replication-deficient vaccine that can also be used in people with immunodeficiencies or other conditions who couldn\u2019t receive the original vaccine. However, the WHO states that there is currently no need for mass vaccination against monkeypox, and the vaccine should be limited to those at high risk of infection. The reuse or misuse of photos of rashes attributed to monkeypox isn\u2019t evidence that the current outbreak is a hoax Some Facebook posts shared multiple screenshots of news articles that illustrated the current monkeypox outbreak with reused photos of skin rashes or stock photos that appeared earlier on other websites. This fact-check by PolitiFact extensively researched the origin of each of these photos. The posts suggested that, because the images were used before, current monkeypox cases aren\u2019t real. However, this implication is incorrect. While the use of a generic image might potentially mislead the readers about the circumstances of the event, it doesn\u2019t make the actual event less real. This would be like saying that a basketball match never took place simply because someone used a stock image in a news report about that match. Purchasing stock images or reusing file photos to illustrate articles is common practice in media outlets and none of the articles, which were published in The Independent, NBC News, BBC News, and the Daily Mail, stated that the photos were current. That said, in an article published by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, KMIZ News director Curtis Varns explained that using generic images without correctly attributing their source can be \u201cvery misleading\u201d and have a \u201clong-term impact on credibility\u201d. The best practice is to clearly disclose that the image is an \u201cillustration\u201d, he said. This Facebook post is a good example of how generic images can harm credibility, particularly when misused. The post juxtaposed two screenshots of articles showing the same photo of a hand with a rash. One of the screenshots illustrated shingles rash on the website of the department of health of Queensland, Australia. The other one was from an article on the website The Health Site, which incorrectly used the same shingles photo in a story about a case of monkeypox identified in the U.S. in May 2021. Although both monkeypox and shingles cause similar symptoms, including rash, they are different diseases caused by different viruses. Shingles are caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is also responsible for chickenpox. Thus, the incorrect use of the shingles photo to illustrate the rash caused by monkeypox was misused one year later to cast suspicion on the monkeypox outbreak. Conclusion Vaccine ingredients, pandemic tabletop exercises, and reused pictures don\u2019t provide evidence that the monkeypox outbreak doesn\u2019t exist, was planned, or results from laboratory experiments or COVID-19 vaccination. Those claims are unsubstantiated by any scientific evidence and remain in the realm of conspiracy theories. UPDATE (1 June 2022): This review was updated to add a statement by the NTI explaining that the monkeypox virus shows no signs of engineering and to provide further context regarding the strains of the virus involved in the monkeypox outbreak.

An interview with the artist in Time Out from May says that he's based in Birmingham and that he describes his work as \"'misinformation' and 'IRL trolling'\". Eagle-eyed readers may have spotted a few other clues that the advert wasn't all it seemed. For one, Transport for London, which is responsible for the London Underground, doesn't allow adverts that promote \"a party political cause or electioneering\" . Other clues are the fact that the advert clearly isn't the correct size for the tube car panel it's stuck to, as well as the unfortunate wording used.

        "doc": "CLAIM \u201cPotassium chloride actually causes cardiac arrest [\u2026] and we\u2019re drinking it in Dasani water.\u201d more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Social media users, Facebook, TikTok, 16 Sep. 2022 DETAILS Misleading: Potassium chloride is a common nutrient found in bottled waters and is safe to consume at the concentrations found in bottled water. The amount of potassium chloride in bottled water isn\u2019t comparable to the amount given in lethal injections. KEY TAKE AWAY The majority of bottled water brands contain a mix of minerals that add taste. One of these is potassium chloride, which can be found in brands like Dasani. It\u2019s important to remember that it's \u201cthe dose that makes the poison\u201d. Even water, when taken in excess quantities, can kill. The same goes for potassium chloride. While it\u2019s used as a means of execution in some countries, including the U.S., the amount of potassium chloride present in these injections is many times higher than the amounts found in bottled water. FULL CLAIM: \u201cDasani Water is actually really, really bad for you. There\u2019s three ingredients that make it the absolutely worse water bottle ever. [\u2026] And the last one, potassium chloride. This is where they get you bad. Have you ever heard of death row? So on death row, they inject you with three different injections, and the last one they inject in you is potassium chloride. Potassium chloride actually causes cardiac arrest and it makes the heart stop working. And we\u2019re drinking it in Dasani water\u201d. REVIEW On 16 September 2022, a Facebook user shared a TikTok video that claimed that Dasani Water, a Coca-Cola Company product, is \u201cthe most dangerous water\u201d because it contains potassium chloride. The 59-second video went on to claim that potassium chloride is injected into individuals on death row and that it \u201ccauses cardiac arrest and it makes the heart stop working.\u201d The clip was shared more than 6,900 times and received nearly five thousand likes on Facebook. Similar claims were also made by other TikTok users (see here and here), including other TikTok videos containing the same clip (here). As we\u2019ll show below, this claim is false. The original TikTok clip was posted on TikTok on 26 May 2021 by the podcast group JustTheNobodys. The audio on that video was muted by TikTok, but the creators of the account reiterated their claims about Dasani water and how potassium chloride \u201cis used to kill people\u201d in a 28 June 2021 video uploaded to YouTube. This isn\u2019t the first time individuals on social media cast doubt over the safety of the ingredients in Dasani and other bottled waters, warning people against drinking them. A 24 July 2020 fact-check by USA Today addressed a false claim that warned people against drinking the bottled water brand Great Value from Walmart, because it contained calcium chloride. According to USA Today, \u201ccalcium chloride is safe to consume. It\u2019s added to water for taste and serves as an electrolyte to keep you from getting dehydrated\u201d. A 7 April 2020 article from Business Insider showed that the ingredients in Dasani were similar to those in other bottled waters, after a YouTuber named Shane Dawson falsely suggested that there was something unusual about Dasani\u2019s ingredients. As with these previous claims, the claim that the potassium chloride in Dasani is dangerous and can cause \u201ccardiac arrests\u201d is false. First, potassium chloride and other minerals containing potassium are essential to the human body. Potassium is necessary for a number of vital bodily functions, including muscle contraction, energy production, and maintaining blood pressure and normal kidney function. Chloride, which is most commonly found in salt in the form of sodium chloride, is also necessary; it\u2019s an essential component of digestive juices and helps maintain the proper balance of body fluids. Second, while potassium chloride is the last in a three-drug sequence used for lethal injections in some parts of the U.S. and its role is indeed to cause death via cardiac arrest, the dose of potassium chloride in lethal injections and in Dasani water are completely different. Speaking to AFP, which addressed a similar claim about the potassium chloride in Dasani water on 18 June 2021, Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist and expert on physician participation in lethal injection, said that \u201camounts of potassium chloride in bottled water and the quantity administered in a lethal injection are \u2018not comparable\u2019\u201d. It\u2019s helpful to remember the toxicology adage \u201cthe dose makes the poison\u201d, which reminds us that any substance, even water, can be a poison if consumed at high enough doses. The Coca-Cola Company, which produces Dasani, told AFP that: \u201cAlthough we are unable to disclose the exact quantities of minerals added to our water, we can tell you that the amounts of these minerals (including salt) are so minuscule that the US Food and Drug Administration considers them negligible.\u201d Third, the administration route of potassium chloride makes a difference. Experts, including Zivot, told the AFP that \u201can intravenous dose of potassium chloride\u2013as would be administered for a lethal injection\u2013is far more dangerous than ingesting the compound\u201d. This is because the injection delivers potassium chloride directly into the bloodstream, whereas when one drinks potassium chloride it needs to travel to the bloodstream. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers potassium chloride a Generally Recognized as Safe substance, meaning this substance \u201cis generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use\u201d. In conclusion, while potassium chloride is used in lethal injections to cause cardiac arrest, the amount of potassium chloride in these injections is many times higher than the amount found in Dasani Water. Furthermore, both potassium and chloride are essential for the human body to function properly. It\u2019s important to remember that the toxicity of a substance depends on the dose and the route of administration. In contrast with lethal injection, the amount of potassium chloride present in bottled water is safe and won\u2019t cause cardiac arrest.",

In short, a combination of factors could be behind the phenomenon of Trump was associated with the word \u201closer,\u201d including the timeliness of the recent election results announcement, as well as the number of tweets that included both the word \u201closer\u201d and the Trump\u2019s handle or name. In response to our query to Twitter about how the platform\u2019s algorithm works to return search results, a spokesperson told us, \u201cIf an account is mentioned often alongside certain terms, they can become algorithmically surfaced together as an association.

        "claim": "Confusion spreads online about 15,000 people detained in Iran",
        "doc": "Amid reports that over 15,000 protesters were arrested in Iran and claims that lawmakers have called for severe punishments, many people online including celebrities published incorrect claims that 15,000 people had already been sentenced to death in the Islamic Republic. Protests have engulfed Iran since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in morality policy custody on Sept. 16 (here). Three events in November led to increased global scrutiny of the violent protests sweeping the country and the government\u2019s crackdown. On Nov. 14, the non-governmental organization Iran Human Rights, citing official reports, said at least 20 protesters were facing a possible death penalty (iranhr.net/en/articles/5584/). Reuters on Nov. 16 reported that Iran\u2019s judiciary had sentenced three protesters to death (here). Meanwhile, as of Nov. 14, more than 15,820 demonstrators had been detained and 344 others had been killed, according to the activist HRANA news agency (here) (here). HRANA has since updated those numbers to 16,033 people detained and 362 protesters killed as of Nov. 17 (here). Hardliners in Iran\u2019s parliament on Nov. 6 had urged the country\u2019s judiciary to \u201cdeal decisively\u201d with those taking part in the unrest (here). \u201cWe ask the judiciary to deal decisively with the perpetrators of these crimes and with all those who assisted in the crimes and provoked rioters,\u201d said 227 lawmakers from Iran\u2019s 290-seat parliament in a statement according to state media (here). A U.N. press release on Nov. 11 expressed concern over what could be meant by these parliamentarians. The statement, citing human rights officials, urged \"Iranian authorities to stop indicting people with charges punishable by death for participation, or alleged participation, in peaceful demonstrations.\" (here). On social media, the picture became blurred. Public officials, celebrities and others shared \u2013 but later removed \u2013 posts incorrectly stating that 15,000 people had been sentenced to death (www.bbc.com/news/63643643). A second letter circulated on social media, purportedly showing a statement by 227 parliamentarians urging the judiciary to consider charging those detained with crimes that can carry the death penalty. Iran\u2019s semi-official state news agency ISNA quoted the parliamentary website as saying that the second letter was fake (bit.ly/3EgO0n4). BBC reporter Kian Sharifi also reported that it was fake (here). Reuters was not able to independently verify the veracity of the letter. Other social media users cited a Nov. 10 Newsweek article titled \u201cIran Protesters Refuse to Back Down as 15,000 Face Execution\u201d as their source (here), (here), (here). The article included the line: \u201cThe country's parliament overwhelmingly voted in favor of the death penalty for protesters.\u201d (here) The magazine issued a correction on Nov. 15, saying the mention of parliament voting for death sentences had been removed and the article now reflected what is known: that \u201ca majority of the parliament supported a letter to the judiciary calling for harsh punishments of protesters, which could include the death penalty.\u201d (here) Newsweek did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Skylar Thompson, the head of advocacy at Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRA), told Reuters: \u201cHRA\u2019s news agency, HRANA, never reported that 15,000 protesters would be sentenced to death. The headline was an irresponsible conflation of several stories.\u201d The fate of those detained, while unknown, has caused concern for many within Iran and beyond. Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, told Reuters via email that while the posts on social media were incorrect, \u201cit does not mean we should not be seriously concerned about the possibility of mass executions in Iran. Execution of even one protester should not be tolerated and it would be unacceptable.\u201d",

In October 2021, the Brooklyn Nets announced that player Kyrie Irving would not be playing for the team this year due to his decision to go against the advice of health officials and a mandate from the state of New York to get vaccinated against COVID-19. When Irving, an NBA player who argued in 2018 that people should do their own research into whether or not the earth was flat, explained his decision in an Instagram video, a few people chimed in, praising his decision and comparing him to late, great boxer, Muhammad Ali. As social media users pushed back against this comparison \u2014 Irving is forfeiting an NBA paycheck by refusing to get a safe and effective vaccine while Ali faced five years in prison for being a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War \u2014 many pointed out that Ali had once encouraged people to get vaccinated. More so, he encouraged people to comply with vaccine mandates. In 1978, Ali filmed a public service announcement with the New York City Department of Health as part of their \u201cNo Shots, No School\u201d campaign that encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated against mumps, measles, and polio so that they can go to school. The PSA ends with Ali saying \u201cNo shot, no school. It\u2019s the law.\u201d This is a genuine PSA featuring Ali that encouraged vaccinations. We reached out to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for more information about how and why this PSA was created and we will update this article if more information becomes available. In 1980, this PSA was referenced during the U.S Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 15th Immunization Conference Proceedings in Colorado as health officials discussed New York\u2019s efforts to increase the immunization rate. Barry Ensminger, counsel to the city council president of New York, noted that while it was required by law for school children to be vaccinated, this law was rarely actually enforced. New York\u2019s law, like that of many other States, requires entering school children to present evidence of adequate immunization status or be excluded from the classroom. School officials, however, had never taken this statute seriously. It was seen as a public health measure \u2013 the responsibility of the Department of Health, not the Board of Education. As a result, no principal had ever been disciplined for admitting unimmunized children, despite provision for fines up to $1,0000 per child. While Ensminger noted the importance of enforcing this law, he also said that another important aspect of raising immunization rates was public education. In order to spread the word about the necessity of vaccines, thousands of posters using the \u201cNo Shots, No School\u201d slogan were placed in New York subways, advertisements were also aired during New York Yankees game and displayed on billboards, McDonald\u2019s franchises offered coupons with proof of vaccination, volunteer skywriters posted pro-vaccine messages above beaches, and, of course, Ali filmed a PSA. Ali\u2019s \u201cNo Shot, No School\u201d PSA was at least the second time that Ali promoted vaccines. In March 2021, the Muhammad Ali Center shared a photograph of Ali receiving a vaccine. While we haven\u2019t been able to find too many details about this photograph, it was likely taken in 1974 when Ali received a Smallpox vaccination before traveling to Zaire, Africa, for the \u201cRumble in the Jungle.\u201d Today is the anniversary of @WHO\u2019s declaration of the #COVID19 pandemic. We honor all of those who have died as a result of the virus, their families & friends, the healthcare and other frontline workers, and the scientists who worked so tirelessly to develop vaccines to help us. pic.twitter.com/d1hAJOSipM \u2014 Muhammad Ali Center (@AliCenter) March 11, 2021 Sources: Deb, Sopan. \u201cKyrie Irving Doesn\u2019t Know If the Earth Is Round or Flat.

Claim: A survey by \u2018The Institute of World Demographics Research\u2019 has predicted that, by 2041, out of India\u2019s total population, Muslims would account for 84%. Fact: No information was found about any international organisation with the name \u2018The Institute of World Demographics Research\u2019. Also, as per a report of \u2018Pew Research Centre\u2019, by 2050, out of India\u2019s total population, Muslims would account for 18.4%. So, the claim made in the post is \u2018FALSE\u2019. When searched on Google for \u2018The Institute of World Demographics Research\u2019, it was found that there is no such international institute with that name. When searched for information regarding the religion-wise demographic pattern of India in the coming years, an article of \u2018Pew Research Centre\u2019 was found. In the article, it was predicted that, by 2050, out of India\u2019s total population, Muslim\u2019s would account for 18.4%. \u2018Pew Research Centre\u2019, is an American \u2018think tank\u2019 that provides information about demographic trends in the world.

Also, in the post, the population of Muslims in India,in 2011, as per the official data was quoted as \u201822.6%\u2019. But as per 2011 Census, Muslims population in the country was only \u201814.2%\u2019.

        "claim": "Since Rick Perry became governor, \"poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% \u2014 which is higher than the national average.\"",
        "doc": "As Rick Perry delivered his last gubernatorial speech to state legislators, the Democratic National Committee suggested the state is worse off thanks to the Republican\u2019s long tenure. Part of a Jan. 15, 2015, email blast from the committee said: \"Since Perry took office, poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% \u2014 which is higher than the national average.\" That so? A committee spokeswoman, Miryam Lipper, told us by email the cited figures come from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2000, Lippert said, 15.1 percent of Texans were living below the federal poverty threshold; in 2013, she said, 17.5 percent of Texans were living in poverty. Perry, initially sworn in as governor in late December 2000, yielded the office to Greg Abbott, previously the Republican state attorney general, on Jan. 20, 2015. And Lipper guided us to a September 2013 bureau report stating that nationally according to the bureau\u2019s 2000 American Community Survey, 12.2 percent of the U.S. population (33.3 million people) had income below the poverty level. A chart in the report says an estimated 15.1 percent of Texans, 3,056,244 residents, lived in poverty in 2000. Lipper also noted a September 2014 bureau report stating 17.5 percent of Texans, 4,530,039, lived below poverty in 2013. Nationally that year, according to the report, 15.8 percent of residents, 48,810,868 people, lived below poverty. So, the Texas poverty rate exceeded the national rate through the second-to-last year of Perry\u2019s governorship \u2014 as it did before he took the state\u2019s helm in 2000. The state\u2019s poverty rate in 2013 was 2.4 percentage points higher than the year Perry became governor. Nationally, the 2013 rate was 3.6 percentage points higher than the U.S. rate in 2000. The government uses measures of poverty called \"poverty thresholds\" to help determine the number of residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty. Those thresholds, adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. In 2013, for instance, the poverty threshold for a family of four was $23,834. With help from a Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, we confirmed the figures cited by the Democratic group. Bernstein said, though, that the way the bureau has checked poverty levels each year changed about a decade ago; so, it\u2019s best only to compare the results from a supplemental survey to the 2000 Census to American Community Survey results for each year since 2005. From 2005 through 2013, Texas had a greater share of residents living in poverty than the nation as a whole, ACS survey results suggest, though in all but one of the years, the gap between Texas and the nation narrowed or stayed steady. In 2013, the latest year of available estimates, 17.5 percent of Texans lived in poverty, according to the ACS, compared with 15.8 percent of U.S. residents. It could be, then, that conditions in Texas were improving as Perry approached the end of his time as governor. People in Poverty (%), U.S. and Texas, 2005 through 2013 Year U.S. Poverty Rate Texas Poverty Rate Difference (Percentage Points) 2005 13.3 % 17.6 % 4.3 2006 13.3 % 16.9 % 3.6 2007 13 % 16.3 % 3.3 2008 13.2 % 15.8 % 2.6 2009 14.3 % 17.2 % 2.9 2010 15.3 % 17.9 % 2.6 2011 15.9 % 18.5 % 2.6 2012 15.9 % 17.9 % 2.0 2013 15.8 % 17.5 % 1.7 Source: American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates, via American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Jan. 16, 2015) We also asked a University of Texas researcher, Daniel Dillon, for his analysis of changes in poverty in Texas and nationally. Dillon, citing another Census Bureau tool, the Current Population Survey, said 16.2 percent of Texans lived in poverty in 2000, the year Perry became governor, though the rate was down to 15.7 percent in his first months in office. In 2013, by that measure, 16.8 percent of Texans lived in poverty. \"So to summarize, the poverty rate has gone up in TX from 15.7 to 16.8 (percent) from 2001 to 2013 (from what I\u2019m seeing from the Census). It is important to note, however, that the overall poverty rate in the U.S. has also gone up during this time\u2014from 11.6 in 2001 to 14.5 to 2013 (cited from the same data tables),\" Dillon wrote. Dillon said the government relies on CPS results to generate official poverty estimates. A bureau web page says the CPS surveys fewer people but asks many additional questions; the ACS reaches more households with just eight income-related questions. \"Neither one is right or wrong, they are just different surveys,\" Dillon wrote, a characterization also made to our inquiry by spokesman Oliver Bernstein of the Texas-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates programs that serve the poor. Governor\u2019s role? We asked Dillon if Perry\u2019s actions as governor drove the poverty rate. Dillon said it\u2019s hard to sift out particular effects from actions by a governor. \"There is decades of debate on these issues so take this with a grain of salt, but in general I think economists would say that poverty is fairly responsive to the larger economy,\" Dillon said. \"This is especially true with downturns in the economy \u2014 economic shocks like recessionary periods have a notable effect on poverty. This happened under Perry\u2019s term, whether he had anything to do with it or not. The same is true for growth. When the economy grows, poverty tends to decline.\" Also, Dillon said, it\u2019s worth stressing that most anti-poverty efforts are undertaken by the federal government. Dillon also passed along a comment by Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, who said that generally Texas\u2019 poverty rates will exceed national rates \"because we have a large number of single parents and of Hispanics, which have high rates of poverty. That said,\" Osborne said, \"we invest very little in our families\" through state government. Our ruling The Democratic group said that since Perry became governor in late 2000, \"poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% \u2014 which is higher than the national average.\" These figures are supported by U.S. Census Bureau surveys, but they don\u2019t tell the full story. Texas\u2019 poverty rate went down and then up again over Perry\u2019s decade-plus as governor, and the gap between the nation and Texas ultimately narrowed. Finally, it\u2019s unreasonable to lay all blame for a state\u2019s poverty rate on its governor; national economic factors dominate.

        "claim": "\"Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent\" turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road \"would be from folks outside Missouri.\"",
        "doc": "The search for money to fund infrastructure improvements has Gov. Jay Nixon open to the idea of turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road. On Aug. 20, Nixon spoke to nearly 1,000 people at the State Fair\u2019s 63rd annual Governor\u2019s Ham Breakfast. After the event, Nixon took questions from reporters and shared his thoughts on turning I-70 into a toll road. Nixon said, \"almost nine out of every 10 pennies\" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. \"Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent there would be from folks outside Missouri, with the federal dollars, and then (with) the folks traveling through here,\" Nixon said. \"So you can get a road built, 90 percent (of) a brand new road, by non-Missourians, (a road) that we use a lot. ... I think that's still is something that should be looked at very carefully.\" The numbers Nixon cited jumped out at us, so we decided to see if he had his facts right. The journey for answers began by reaching out to Scott Holste, the governor\u2019s press secretary. Holste said Nixon\u2019s claim was \"part of an extemporaneous answer to a reporter\u2019s question at the State Fair.\" The numbers cited by Nixon for the construction revenue of I-70 would be based on tolls collected from vehicles, as well as construction funds received from the federal government, Holste said. He also provided a Missouri Department of Transportation report, which lays out tolling options for I-70. The project cost could range between $2 billion and $4 billion. The report analyzed a 200-mile stretch of I-70 from Independence, Mo. to Wentzville, Mo. (Basically, all of I-70 in Missouri outside the St. Louis and Kansas City metro areas.) No data from the report, however, aligned exactly with Nixon\u2019s claim, but there were some interesting details about truck traffic, which Holste pointed out. \"Some 70 percent of the truck traffic on I-70 originates and terminates from outside the 200-mile study limits of Independence to Wentzville \u2013 many of those originate or are destined from locations outside Missouri,\" the report stated. Put another way, trucks passing through this stretch continue on to somewhere else. Holste said this information suggests those trucks come from out-of-state. In addition, trucks would face a toll rate two to three times higher than the 10-15 cents per mile rate for passenger vehicles, according to the report. Add those two facts together, Holste said, and it suggests out-of-state trucks would carry a greater share of the cost a per-vehicle basis. Not 90 percent, but something. In addition to truck traffic bringing in extra dollars, Holste said the federal government will help pave the way. Under The Highway Trust Fund, the federal government is responsible for reimbursing states a certain project types. This means up to 80 percent of construction costs will be paid by funds from the federal level, Holste said. So, in theory, 80 percent of the revenue used to fund an I-70 toll road would come from the federal government. But that by itself is misleading. The transportation trust fund is dependent on fuel taxes paid in each state, which are deposited in the trust fund to pay for transportation projects. In other words, Missourians would be responsible for a portion of the funding for the trust through the gas taxes they\u2019ve paid. We wanted to be thorough in our analysis of Nixon\u2019s claim so we contacted Bob Brendel, the special assignments coordinator for MoDOT and a contributing writer of the original report Nixon\u2019s office cited. When asked about Nixon\u2019s claim, he said the best data for what we are looking for is in the MoDOT report. The data supporting out of state truck traffic comes from a study conducted between 2006 and 2009, Brendel said. The report Holste provided was prepared in 2014 to provide data to support the idea of turning I-70 into a toll road. The data paint an interesting picture for out-of-state truck traffic, but don\u2019t touch on how much toll revenue might be paid by out-of-state or \"non-Missourian\" drivers if I-70 was a toll road. \"To determine the percentage of traffic from out of state would require a detailed origin-and-destination study that has not been conducted,\" Brendel said. Brendel also pointed out another important feature about the Highway Trust Fund. The portion of money from the federal government would only reimburse Missouri for 80 percent of project work. So Missouri would only see federal money after construction is complete. Our ruling Nixon claimed that \"nine out of every 10 pennies\" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. His office later clarified that the remark was \"part of an extemporaneous answer\" to a question from a reporter. In reality, it\u2019s a guess. The report Nixon\u2019s office cited includes many interesting traffic figures, but none of them support his specific claim. And while the federal highway trust fund would cover much of the work, some of that money comes from gas taxes paid by Missourians. Nixon has a point that a toll road would bring in a good chunk of revenue from out-of-state drivers and the federal government. But 90 percent? That\u2019s an unsubstantiated guess. We rate this claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"Kari Lake has been appearing at rallies with neo-Nazis,\" while \"two federal juries have found\" Katie Hobbs \"guilty of racial discrimination.\"",
        "doc": "In the race for governor in Arizona, one candidate went icepick-sharp with an attack that cut competitors on both the right and left. The TV ad from former state representative Aaron Lieberman, a Democrat, hit the two frontrunners, Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs. \"Right now, Arizona\u2019s politics are a dumpster fire,\" Lieberman said into the camera, as flames rose from a trash container behind him. \"Kari Lake has been appearing at rallies with neo-Nazis. And she\u2019s beating Katie Hobbs, who two federal juries have found guilty of racial discrimination.\" The ad ends with Lieberman appearing to spray the dumpster with a fire extinguisher. There is only an element of truth in both parts of Lieberman\u2019s attack. We did not find evidence that Lake, a former anchor for Fox 10 News in Phoenix who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has been sharing a stage generally with neo-Nazis. The ad cited a November CNN report that said Lake \"embraced\" three \"fringe far-right figures in her campaign events,\" including Greyson Arnold. The report said Lake posed for a photo and video with Arnold at one of her rallies in August. CNN reported that after Arnold posted a photo on Twitter, Lake replied, \"It was a pleasure to meet you, too.\" The report called Arnold a Nazi sympathizer with a history of making white nationalist, racist, antisemitic and pro-Nazi statements. A previous CNN report also said Arnold repeatedly shared memes saying the U.S. fought on the wrong side in World War II. Months later, the Arizona Mirror reported that Arnold used his social media pages to post memes lauding Nazis as the \"pure race\" and lamenting the American victory in World War II. Arnold told the Mirror his posts were taken out of context, and he denied being a white nationalist or supporting Nazi ideology. When we asked a Lake campaign spokesperson in emails about the Lieberman ad, the spokesperson did not specifically answer questions about Arnold. Arnold himself told PolitiFact: \"CNN is fake news.\" Hobbs, then the Democratic leader of the Arizona Senate, did have a role in the 2015 firing of Talonya Adams, an Arizona Senate policy adviser who won a racial discrimination lawsuit. But Hobbs was not personally charged in the matter. Adams, who is Black and represented herself, sued the Senate, alleging that she was fired for raising concerns about racial and gender discrimination because she was paid less than white male peers. Adams alleged in the lawsuit that after she emailed a staff supervisor to discuss her job status, Hobbs told Adams that her email was inappropriate, because Adams had already discussed her status with Hobbs, the supervisor and another official. A jury agreed with Adams\u2019 discrimination claims and awarded her $1 million after a trial in 2019. But the Senate was granted a second trial after its attorneys argued that Adams could not claim retaliation because she did not first inform Senate leaders that she believed discrimination was taking place. Adams won the second trial, in November 2021, when a jury found she was the victim of retaliation. The jury awarded her $2.75 million, though a federal cap law is expected to reduce that to $300,000. Hobbs testified at both trials that she participated in the discussion to terminate Adams, saying she had lost trust in Adams over her decision to take emergency leave to care for her son in Seattle, and because of other chain-of-command issues, according to news reports. Hobbs reiterated that point in a November 2021 letter to her campaign supporters, writing: \"I take responsibility for my role in the decision to terminate Ms. Adams, and I stand by what I\u2019ve consistently said, that this decision on my part was not based on gender or race.\" Hobbs issued another statement in December 2021, apologizing to Adams. Unlike in her November letter, Hobbs said discrimination occurred, telling the Arizona Republic: \"I know that in proceeding in her termination, I participated in furthering systemic racism.\" Hobbs issued the apology after Black community leaders and others criticized Hobbs' initial response to the second jury verdict, the Arizona Republic reported. Arizona\u2019s primaries are Aug. 2. Campaign watchers rate the Nov. 8 general election as a toss up. The major Republican candidates in the governor\u2019s race include Lake; Karrin Taylor Robson, of an Arizona political dynasty; and former U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon. The major Democratic candidates are Hobbs, Lieberman and former Nogales Mayor Marco Lopez. Lieberman said that Lake \"has been appearing at rallies with neo-Nazis\" and \"two federal juries have found\" Hobbs \"guilty of racial discrimination.\" Lieberman is exaggerating the facts to cast his opponents in the worst light possible. Lake posed for a photo and video at one of her campaign rallies with one man who is identified in news reports as a Nazi sympathizer, but there\u2019s no evidence that this was anything more than a random interaction at a campaign event. Hobbs, now Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, was the Democratic leader of the Arizona Senate when she participated in the 2015 decision to fire an Arizona Senate employee who later successfully sued the Arizona Senate for racial discrimination. Hobbs herself was not sued, which means no court made a finding specifically against her. Lieberman\u2019s claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

A viral social media post claimed that French Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier said that individuals vaccinated for COVID-19 would die within two years. His purported statement has left many on the internet startled as countries are increasing the vaccination rates. However, the statement has been incorrectly attributed to the Nobel Laureate. Luc Montagnier recently gave an interview to a U.S.-based grassroots and investigative organization named RAIR Foundation. The full transcript of the interview is published on the RAIR website, which clarified that some were attempting to discredit Luc's valid scientific observations about the vaccine and said it's an outright misrepresentation of his words. In the interview, the professor said that the vaccine program for the coronavirus was an \u201cunacceptable mistake\u201d and is creating variants leading to more deaths. He has also expressed concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). He further said that persons who have taken the vaccine jab are creating variants resistant to the vaccine. However, WHO and many other health authorities have claimed that the vaccines are safe against COVID-19, and changes or mutations in the virus should not make vaccines completely ineffective. Despite making some controversial statements during his interview with the RAIR Foundation, Luc Montagnier did not say that individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 will die within two years. Such quotes attributed to him on some social media posts are baseless and not true. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation.

Biden was responding to a moderator\u2019s question about his failure to get an expanded background check bill passed after the Sandy Hook school mass shooting in 2012. The recent polls we found showed that a majority of Americans support banning assault weapons, but by a much smaller margin than Biden cited. A 1994 law barred the \"manufacture, transfer, and possession\" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. The ban expired in 2004. Efforts to renew the ban have been unsuccessful, but Biden has vowed to champion a ban. We looked at the results of five polls taken after the early August mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. We limited our search to that time period because the question by debate moderator David Muir mentioned the El Paso shooting. Overall, polls showed between 56% and 70% of people back a ban on assault rifles. Polls showed higher support among Democrats. Politico/Morning Consult poll: Nearly 70% of all voters would back a ban on assault rifles. (In a New York Times op-ed in August, Biden cited that statistic.) More than 91 percent supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. Fox News poll: 67% supported banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. The poll found 90% support for background checks on all gun buyers including at shows and private sales. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll: 57% said Congress should pass a ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault guns such as the AK-47 or the AR-15. The poll found 83% support for requiring background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales Washington Post/ABC News poll: 56% support a ban on the sale of assault weapons. 89% support requiring background checks for all potential gun buyers. HuffPost/YouGov poll:59% favor an assault weapons ban and 81% favored background checks. We asked the Biden campaign for his evidence and did not hear back immediately. We wondered whether Biden was referring to the percentage of Americans who support expanding background checks, which was in the ballpark of 90% in many polls. Biden said \"over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street \u2060\u2014 period.\" We looked at five polls following the El Paso and Dayton shootings in early August.

        "claim": "California will have the \"highest gas tax in the nation\" once its 12 cent gas tax hike goes into effect.",
        "doc": "Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno recently claimed California would soon have the \"highest gas tax in the nation.\" He made the claim in a press release days after the California Legislature passed a 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax hike, part of a funding package to raise billions of dollars for state road repairs. \"The $52 billion tax will also put Californians in a special, yet unenviable category \u2013 drivers who pay the highest gas tax in the nation,\" Patterson said in the release issued April 10, 2017. With Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s signature the bill will go into effect in November. The Golden State\u2019s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country. Our research Asked for evidence, Patterson\u2019s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation. That map and its numbers, however, are outdated. A map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates.Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees. It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58cents. California\u2019s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation. Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California\u2019s tax will trail Pennsylvania\u2019s by 8cents per gallon. \"You won\u2019t be No. 1, that\u2019s for sure,\" said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. \"Pennsylvania will still be the highest.\" A chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation\u2019s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state. Based on current rates, California\u2019s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii. This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts. We looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California\u2019s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii\u2019s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said. Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline. This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state\u2019s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which \"would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania,\" Henchman said. Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not. Our ruling Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California\u2019s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the \"highest gas tax in the nation.\" Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates. Current figures from the Tax Foundation show California\u2019s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania\u2019s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November. California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation. These figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute. In the end, we rate Patterson\u2019s claim False. UPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline. The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California\u2019s new legislation. It concluded \"Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin.\" This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November. The state\u2019s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California\u2019s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation\u2019s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concludedthis higherCalifornia gas tax, even in 2019, would be \"just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax.\" FALSE\u2013The statement is not accurate.

        "claim": "Because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, \u201cthe Fed will be of little consequence now. They\u2019ve already used what leverage they have.\u201d",
        "doc": "With a coronavirus-driven recession in sight, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden lamented what he said was the Federal Reserve\u2019s waning power to stabilize the nation\u2019s economy. During the March 15 debate with rival Bernie Sanders, Biden was asked by Univision journalist Ilia Calder\u00f3n, \"Just hours ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near 0%, which has not happened since the financial crisis in 2008. Vice President Biden, what would you do?\" Biden called for a major bailout that benefits vulnerable individuals. Then he said, \"We\u2019ve eaten a lot of our seed corn here. The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this god-awful tax cut of $1.9 trillion. \u2026 The Fed will be of little consequence now, they\u2019ve already used what leverage they have, and so we\u2019re going to have to just level with the American people.\" It turns out that Biden\u2019s wrong about the Federal Reserve: It does have other arrows in its quiver. \"What Biden was referring to is what the Fed has done in typical times since the 1970s \u2014 moving around the short-term interest rate,\" said Gary Richardson, a University of California-Irvine economist who specializes in the Federal Reserve. \"But the Fed has many other tools it can use.\" When we asked Biden\u2019s campaign to explain the remark, they noted that the rest of his answer also addressed fiscal policy \u2014 federal spending and taxation \u2014 which has been constrained by large tax cuts and high spending during the Trump era. Specifically on the Fed, the Biden campaign pointed to comments made by former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke in January, which was before a coronavirus-driven recession was widely considered likely. Even in those relatively stable times, Bernanke told an economists\u2019 conference that existing low interest rates reduced the Fed\u2019s flexibility, and Yellen added that \"although monetary policy has a meaningful role to play in future downturns, it's unlikely to be sufficient in the years ahead,\" the Financial Times reported. However, the Financial Times report noted a key caveat that Biden\u2019s remark doesn\u2019t account for. The article said the Fed\u2019s \"alternative tools such as asset purchases and forward guidance were robust.\" First, let\u2019s explain the tool that Biden accurately says the Fed has maxed out. That\u2019s the federal funds rate, the most commonly used, and most direct, lever the Fed can use. The federal funds rate applies to overnight loans between financial institutions. While the fed funds rate doesn\u2019t directly affect consumers, its impact spirals outward as financial institutions set rates that do affect everyday customers, such as those for credit cards, mortgages and other loans. For years after the Great Recession, the Fed set this rate at or near zero in order to promote lending and stimulate the recovery. After a series of step-by-step increases beginning in 2016, the rate was reduced earlier this month to be effectively zero again. So what else can the Fed do to affect interest rates? It can try to shape perceptions about rates over the longer term, and in so doing, help stabilize the economy. One of those tools that has been used regularly since the 2008 recession is known as \"forward guidance.\" It\u2019s basically an effort by the Fed to telegraph its future intentions on rate-setting, communicated through a standardized set of public statements and tables. Communicating this clearly to investors provides a greater sense of certainty about the future. The Fed could make this type of announcement at its next regularly scheduled meeting, which is set for April 28 and 29, although it could call an unscheduled meeting sooner. The next tool has been commonly known in recent years as \"quantitative easing.\" It involves the Fed purchasing assets that have longer time horizons, such as U.S. government securities. Less frequently, it can involve buying \"commercial paper\" \u2014 short-term IOUs that companies take out to cover temporary cash flow shortages. Indeed, just two days after the Biden-Sanders debate, the Fed announced that it was using this tool. This effort by the Fed \"ensures that companies can get the overnight funding they need to meet short-term obligations like payroll,\" Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist at Evercore ISI, told the New York Times. In 2008, after the collapse of the financial firm Lehman Brothers, the Fed \"intervened in commercial paper in a very large way. Asset purchases don\u2019t just provide security for stressed companies; they can also be used to affect longer-term interest rates. The Fed can buy assets, driving their price up until longer-term interest rates show the movement the Fed wants. But sometimes influencing interest rates is not enough, because the economic environment is so bad that institutions are unwilling to make loans no matter what the rate is. \"In times like that, the credit markets can freeze up,\" Richardson said, meaning that credit is unavailable anywhere, and the economy spirals down further. When that happens, there is still more that the Fed can do. One thing the Fed can do to stop that cycle is to get financial institutions to make loans simultaneously, a sign of solidarity that is designed to bolster confidence and spread risk. They can also encourage banks to use the \"discount window\" \u2014 a mechanism for banks to get Fed loans at a favorable rate, with the understanding that they will make the credit available to the public. This week, the Fed reopened one mechanism used during the last recession to make short-term loans to banks. The Fed can also make loan guarantees. For instance, it could guarantee loans to strategic industries, so banks can lend more confidently. In wartime, this might mean loan guarantees for companies that make military goods. In the current crisis, it could be used to back loans for companies to expand ventilator production. Some of these emergency powers were limited by the 2010 Dodd-Frank act, which overhauled aspects of the financial services industry, particularly in ways that increased transparency. But the Fed still has significant levers it can use in a crisis. Biden said that because the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates to near 0%, \"the Fed will be of little consequence now. They\u2019ve already used what leverage they have.\" Dropping the federal funds rate to near 0% does make it hard for the Fed to use that particular piece of leverage. But the Fed has other levers. It can telegraph its intentions about longer-term interest rates, it can purchase assets such as short-term commercial IOUs (something the Fed has already begun doing), and it can work with financial institutions to encourage lending and guarantee loans. We rate the statement False.",

        "claim": "Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s vote helped pass \"Barack Obama\u2019s job-killing health care law, which slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase.\"",
        "doc": "With Congress out for its Easter-Passover break, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown started making the rounds with constituent and factory visits in early April. One of those stops was at the Nucor steel plant in Marion, where the Democratic freshman discussed what he calls the unfair trade practices of China.The National Republican Senatorial Committee meantime had a list of other subjects it thought Brown, who faces reelection in November, should discuss during his local visits. Making suggestions in a pointed news release, NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox said, \"One of the things we expect that Brown will not be discussing is his 60th vote for Barack Obama\u2019s job-killing health care law, which slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase.\"This single statement had several elements that made us say, \"Huh?\" Was Brown the 60th vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act? That\u2019s a point of dispute, because the NRSC had already said that Montana Democrat Jon Tester had that honor (though Tester\u2019s staff debunked it with a videotape showing him as the 52nd \"yes\" vote, Politico reported). The NRSC or its affiliates have also accused Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Claire McCaskill of Missouri of casting that crucial vote. Taking heat for being the 60th senator to actually commit that he would vote \"yes,\" thus assuring passage regardless of the order in which the actual roll call went, was Ben Nelson of Nebraska.But Brown certainly voted for the health care bill, so let\u2019s not get hung up on which senator had the ultimate vote. More intriguing than that was the NRSC\u2019s claim that the bill \"slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase.\"That would be a heck of an increase, were it true.But it is not. Every piece of information the NRSC sent us to back up its $500 billion claim pertained to a national figure, not a figure for a single state. And it applied to all taxes and fees associated with what both parties are now calling Obamacare, not just the portion that would be paid by small businesses.The NRSC\u2019s sources for this included testimony and supporting documents from the Congressional Budget Office, submitted to the House of Representatives\u2019 Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s health subcommittee on March 30, 2011. PolitiFact recently examined another claim based on this figure and its supporting documents, after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce used the number in an ad criticizing Tester. There\u2019s no need to repeat that examination at length, but we\u2019ll note that PolitiFact found that the $500 billion number was \"a fair number for total revenue raised by the 2010 health care law as estimated when Tester voted \u2014 but the number for just taxes is lower, likely between $400 billion and $465 billion.\"The rest was for various other fees and revenue enhancements, which opens a debate as to whether they should be called taxes. But there\u2019s no need for that here.Yes, some businesses will pay higher taxes if the law is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The NRSC sent us plenty of examples from news stories as well as a recent editorial from the Columbus Dispatch. Among the companies already preparing for this are medical device manufacturers like Invacare, based in Elyria, which has estimated a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices could cost it anywhere from $12 million to more than $20 million annually. Backers of the health care law suggest that medical device companies will make up at least some of the revenue because more people will have health insurance and buy medical products. Industry officials are skeptical.Invacare is a global company, however. There are certainly small, Ohio-based companies that will be taxed more under the law. But will these small Ohio businesses be slapped with a $500 billion tax hike, thanks to Brown and others who supported the bill, regardless of their order?No.We are not aware of a good analysis to show the exact share that small Ohio businesses would pay of that $500 billion in new revenue that the government will raise, or whatever the figure will prove to be. We could try to extrapolate, but what\u2019s the point? The NRSC figure is off by a factor of, well, we can\u2019t tell you. We just know that there are 50 states and the CBO figure was for all new revenue nationwide, not just for the share to be paid in taxes by small businesses in Ohio. The NRSC conceded this when we talked it over.Plenty of people dislike the Affordable Care Act. That is a fact. Brown voted for it, and that\u2019s a fact, too. But to pick a national number and apply it to one segment of one state is not accurate and is simply ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, ridiculous claims get a rating of Pants on Fire!",

        "claim": "Says Measures 82 and 83 authorize just one more casino.",
        "doc": "In their campaign ad, \"Different,\" proponents of a new casino in Wood Village assure viewers that their proposal would not lead to a proliferation of gambling complexes in Oregon.\"There are nine casinos in Oregon today,\" the speaker says with words on screen to that effect. Ballot measures \"82 and 83 authorize just one more. The Grange in Wood Village.\"The Grange is a proposed $300 million entertainment complex at the old greyhound racing track in east Multnomah County. We wanted to know if the claim was accurate.First of all, why are there two ballot measures? Let\u2019s work backward, with the simpler measure first. Measure 83 sets the statutory parameters for the casino in Wood Village, including authority for up to 3,500 slot machines. This goes nowhere if Measure 82 is not approved.Why? Because Oregon has a constitutional ban on any casinos not run by tribes. Measure 82 would delete that language to allow the Oregon Lottery to permit \"a taxpaying casino\" -- i.e. a nontribal casino -- only if certain conditions are met: Voters authorize the casino by initiative petition. This is what these casino backers did, paying for circulators to collect enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Now voters statewide get to vote. The casino will be in an incorporated city, with residents in that city voting to approve the casino. Wood Village will vote on a local measure Nov. 6. The casino will be owned and operated by a corporation incorporated in Oregon. PDX Entertainment Company incorporated in March, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. The casino will not be within a 60-mile radius of a tribal casino operating on reservation land in Oregon as of January 2011. The Wood Village casino would be 75 miles away from the Grand Ronde\u2019s Spirit Mountain Casino and 90 miles from the Warm Springs\u2019 Indian Head Casino. And finally, the casino will pay 25 percent of adjusted gross revenue to the state for public schools. This casino proposes to do just that. Those are very specific criteria for a new casino in Oregon. Still, 82 does not put a limit on the number of new private casinos allowed, unlike in 2010 when the same investors tried to change the constitution to allow only their casino. This time, if investors want to open a casino in, say Cascade Locks, they could, provided they go through another round of statewide and local elections.(And just so you know, in 2010, the measure changing the Constitution to allow one casino never made it to the ballot. The companion measure authorizing the Wood Village casino in statute did make it on the ballot and was defeated, two-to-one.)Stacey Dycus, spokeswoman for the Yes on 82 and 83 campaign, said they\u2019re not trying to hide the ball. The ad, she said, was largely in response to remarks by people opposed to the Wood Village casino, including Justin Martin, a lobbyist for the Grand Ronde tribe, which runs the very successful Spirit Mountain Casino.\"Once you knock out the barrier of the Constitution, what's to prevent the Legislature, or the next wealthy executive, from putting one between Salem and Eugene?\" he told The Oregonian last month. (Well, as we spelled out above, lawmakers can\u2019t put one on the ballot, Salem is too close to Spirit Mountain Casino; a spot somewhere south of Salem and north of Eugene may qualify for a casino, if backers go through the steps outlined above.)\"We thought that was creating confusion and that people thought that there might be a misconception,\" Dycus said. \"We\u2019re attempting to run a very fact-driven campaign, to give Oregonians all the information they need to make a choice. And after 83 and 82 pass, there will be just a 10th casino.\"(In response to Dycus\u2019s response, the spokeswoman for the other side said \"the larger issue at stake is whether or not Oregonians want to fundamentally change how gambling is managed in Oregon and allow for multiple private-casinos around the state.\" Fair enough all around.)But PolitiFact Oregon doesn\u2019t care so much about the campaign insiders. We care about the casual viewer who comes across the ad and asks: Would this create just one new casino?To that, we say, yes, it would create one new casino. But we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t tell the viewer that one of the two ballot measures changes the constitution to allow the possibility of more in the future. That detail is important. The Constitution has been amended numerous times, but it\u2019s still the Constitution.We rate the statement Half True -- partially accurate, missing an important detail -- and reserve the right to fact check Martin\u2019s statement in the future.Return to OregonLive to comment on this Politifact/Oregon ruling.",

        "claim": "The Obama administration \"has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem.\"",
        "doc": "Democratic strategist Donna Brazile tried to rebut criticism that President Barack Obama isn't doing enough to control the Gulf of Mexico oil spill response, arguing on ABC's This Week that he has been hamstrung by the actions of Congress 20 years ago.In a back and forth with former labor secretary Robert Reich, Brazile said Congress created a policy that puts BP -- not the federal government -- in charge of the response.\"The present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed up this clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be in charge,\" Reich, a former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton, said. \"The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP's expertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge of all of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines.\"\"Well,\" Brazile said, \"the administration has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem,\" Brazile responded. \"That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BP to come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to mislead people.\"In this fact-check, we wanted to see if Brazile's interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is right -- particularly when it comes to deciding who has the lead role. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound in 1989. The law was designed to better coordinate the government response to a major oil event, and to set penalties for companies responsible. It was approved by Congress and signed into law on Aug. 18, 1990.In general, it gives the president more authority in an oil event, not less.\"When responding to a spill, many considered the lines of responsibility under the pre-OPA regime to be unclear, with too much reliance on spillers to perform proper cleanup,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report. \"OPA strengthened and clarified the federal government's role in oil spill response and cleanup.\"The Oil Pollution Act included amendments to the Clean Water Act to provide the president three options in the wake of an oil event, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The president could: The Environmental Protection Agency describes the OPA this way: \"The OPA improved the nation's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills by establishing provisions that expand the federal government's ability, and provide the money and resources necessary, to respond to oil spills.\"BP ultimately is liable for the cost of cleaning up the spilled oil. The Oil Pollution Act caps additional economic damages at $75 million, but BP has said it will pay all legitimate claims, and some Democrats in Congress want to lift the cap and apply it retroactively. President Obama has said he wants to update the laws to \"make sure that the people in the Gulf, the fishermen, the hotel owners, families who are dependent for their livelihoods in the Gulf, that they are all made whole and that we are in a much better position to respond to any such crisis in the future.\"Still, under the law as it stands today, BP will be paying for the clean-up, and the federal government -- thanks to the OPA -- ultimately has authority over how the clean-up proceeds.We asked Brazile, a native of New Orleans who still has family living there, if there was something we were missing.Brazile said she was trying to point out that the Oil Pollution Act, and the options the president had, may have contributed to the federal government not taking the lead sooner. \"The Administration had every reason to take the lead and not wait,\" Brazile said. \"Perhaps they waited -- and I used the reference to the Act -- as one reason why they did not take the initial lead.\" Brazill also suggested her statement -- which was criticized by the conservative website Newsbusters -- was being used to score political points in the middle of a national crisis. Her first concern, she said, is that people in the Gulf states suffering get help.But in this case, her interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is incorrect. She said the law \"basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem.\" In fact, the Oil Pollution Act specifcially gives the federal government the authority to decide who's in charge of the clean-up -- the polluter or the government. The company, in this case BP, will pay for the clean-up response. But the federal government can give the orders if it chooses. We rate Brazile's statement False.",

        "claim": "Says Romney had the uniforms for the 2002 Winter Olympic games made in Burma.",
        "doc": "With the Olympics about to begin, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC aligned with President Barack Obama, released an ad that used Olympic images to attack Mitt Romney. The ad shows a beaming Romney at the Olympic opening ceremonies. As each national team enters the stadium, an announcer provides a corresponding quip. \"China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney\u2019s companies ... And Burma, where Romney had the uniforms made for the 2002 games.\"Olympic authorities moved swiftly to get Priorities USA Action to withdraw the ad because of unauthorized use of Olympic footage, but the ad got such widespread coverage that we are still fact-checking it.PolitiFact has assessed that claim about jobs in China and and another one about Romney creating jobs in India. Both were rated Half True. In this fact-check, we look at whether Romney had the uniforms for the 2002 winter games made in Burma.The Torch Bearer UniformsBurma, or Myanmar, is a country that until just recently was shunned for being a repressive regime that observed no fair labor practices.Olympic games use many different uniforms -- for staffers, athletes and so forth and not all were made in Burma. But there is no question about the origins of the uniforms for the torch bearers. These were the 11,500 volunteers who relayed the Olympic torch some 13,000 miles to Salt Lake City. That\u2019s a lot of jackets with the Salt Lake Olympic logo.The Huffington Post reported this a couple of weeks ago, but the story received coverage in 2002. The day before the winter games opened, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent a letter of protest to the International Olympic Committee.\"No responsible organization or body should make use of products originating in Burma,\" the letter said. \"Doing business with Burma, in effect, supports human rights abuses.\"The next day, according to an article in the Ottawa Citizen, the company that provided those uniforms, Marker Ltd, confirmed that the uniforms had come from a supplier in Burma. The article quotes Marker\u2019s Olympic program managing director, Ralph Eeson saying the company is \"sensitive to to human rights issues and has no reason to believe the uniforms were made under conditions that violate international law.\"Marker, a Salt Lake City-based sports apparel company, was a co-sponsor of the games. In May of 1999 it had agreed to provide about $20 million worth of clothing. The company was the first new sponsor for the games in about a year because of turmoil over allegations of bribery. The timing of Marker\u2019s sponsorship might be significant. Mitt Romney had just left Bain Capital in February 1999 to takeover the floundering Salt Lake Olympic Committee. Three months after he arrived, Marker signed on.Burma\u2019s ReputationBy 2000, Burma was a pariah. In 1997, the United States barred new investments in Burma by American corporations. The military dictatorship had been sanctioned by many international bodies for using forced labor on large irrigation construction projects and violating child labor standards.\"It was well-known that it was a hell hole,\" said Scott Nova with the Worker Rights Consortium, an agency that helps colleges and universities avoid buying from factories that abuse their workers. Nova\u2019s group traces the roots of all those sweatshirts, T-shirts and hats that carry the college name.The Worker Rights Consortium tracks more than 1,000 companies and each of the dozens of separate items they supply. \"On that entire list,\" Nova said, \"virtually nothing came from Burma in 2000. Maybe three items out of thousands. Every responsible manufacturer was long gone from the country.\"That may have been true for the companies Nova\u2019s group watched, but many American firms continued to buy from Burma. A consortium of 15 European labor and human rights groups, the Clean Clothes Campaign, reported in 2000 that U.S. clothing imports from the country nearly tripled between 1995 and 1999. Companies cited in that report included Jordache, Nautica and Adidas. In 2001, a declassified State Department memo later corroborated that report. Marker was not alone in buying from contractors in Burma.The Winter Olympics BudgetThe ad suggests that Romney played a direct role in ordering the uniforms from Burma, but the only source provided by Priorities USA Action was the Huffington Post article which did not make that direct connection.In assessing his possible role, it's important to note it was a large organization. The SLOC had about 2,000 paid staff. The total budget for the Salt Lake Games was about $1.3 billion. There were about 10 other sponsors like Marker, plus about another 15 firms with marketing contracts. The list included companies such as Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and Gateway Computers. Marker\u2019s sponsorship represented less than 1 percent of the total budget.We have asked the US Olympic Committee if the SLOC used any procurement guidelines and did not hear back. A recent Salt Lake Tribune article about the SLOC archives suggests that detailed information might no longer exist. Many internal memos were destroyed after the games ended.Our RulingThe ad from Priorities USA Action says Romney had the Olympic uniforms made in Burma.The torch bearer uniforms, perhaps more than 11,000 of them, were made in Burma, but that\u2019s not all the uniforms used in the games, particularly for the athletes, as the visuals in the ad suggest. And we've seen insufficient evidence to directly link the torch bearer uniforms to Romney.We rate the statement Mostly False.",

Candidate Obama faced criticism for saying he would talk to Iranian leaders as president. And after he took office, his administration pursued back-channel communications \u2014 meaning secret dialogue outside normal diplomatic processes \u2014 with Iran as part of achieving the nuclear deal. Journalists reported on those processes extensively. We were intrigued by the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before he even won the 2008 election. When we started to dig into it, we were surprised to find that the evidence supporting that narrative is slim and ultimately insufficient. As far as we can tell, this allegation stems solely from the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Ledeen was also a national security consultant to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. He recently co-authored a book with Trump\u2019s ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. Strassel hasn\u2019t replied to our requests for comment, but she defended her comment on Twitter by citing Ledeen\u2019s work. By Ledeen\u2019s account, Miller told him that Obama sent him to Tehran in 2008. Ledeen has made this claim a number of times since at least 2013, in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter in prepared remarks, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact June 1. \"During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies,\" Ledeen wrote in 2014 for conservative website PJ Media. \"The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah's rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign.\" We called up Miller. He said Ledeen\u2019s claims are \"totally untrue.\" Miller told us that he supported Obama\u2019s 2008 candidacy and knew some of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy staff from his decades-long public service career, but he had no role in the campaign or the subsequent administration. Miller does have extensive experience with Iran, starting out as a diplomat there in the 1950s and 1960s. President Jimmy Carter chose Miller to be a lead negotiator during the 1979 hostage crisis, while Miller was serving as staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And as a private citizen, he played a role in the release of American hikers who were imprisoned in Iran from 2009-11. But \"the assertion that Obama sent me as an envoy is totally false,\" he said, adding that he\u2019s met Ledeen a few times but doesn\u2019t really know him. Miller said he travels frequently to Iran but didn\u2019t in 2008. When we told Ledeen that Miller was telling a different story, Ledeen stood by his account. \"(Miller has) changed his mind,\" Ledeen said. \"He\u2019s decided he didn\u2019t go to Tehran.\" So either Ledeen or Miller isn\u2019t telling the truth. We\u2019re sensitive to the idea that someone who was involved in secret communications might not be forthcoming with us about those communications. But it\u2019s also telling that there have been no independent news reports to corroborate Ledeen\u2019s claims, given the extensive reporting on the Obama administration\u2019s relations with Iran and negotiations over the nuclear deal. Marie Harf, who headed the State Department\u2019s Iran nuclear negotiations communications strategy during Obama\u2019s second term, said she hadn\u2019t heard of these allegations until we called her. \"Never in my time at the State Department or working on Iran negotiations did any back channel prior to when we were in office come up,\" she said. Wall Street Journal foreign affairs reporter Jay Solomon, author of The Iran Wars, said he \"could never prove\" that Obama sought a back channel to Iran as a presidential candidate, but he can\u2019t definitively say it didn\u2019t happen. Like Solomon, National Iranian American Council President Trita Parsi never came across any evidence for the alleged back channel while researching either of his two booksabout the Obama administration\u2019s relationship with Iran, including the upcomingLosing an Enemy:Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi questioned Ledeen\u2019s credibility and said, \"At this point, I'm completely convinced this is all B.S.\" Strassel said that in 2008, Obama\u2019s presidential campaign secretly sent former Ambassador William Miller to Iran to talk with Iranian leaders. This is a case of he-said-she-said. A single conservative scholar says Miller told him about his secret \u201808 campaign mission to Iran. Independent journalists who have covered U.S.-Iran relations extensively haven\u2019t been able to confirm the account. There is no corroborating evidence, and Miller says it\u2019s not true; he says he never worked on behalf of the Obama campaign, and he didn\u2019t travel to Iran in 2008. At PolitiFact, we believe the burden is on the speaker to back up their claim with evidence. The evidence here is insufficient, so we rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "\"Twenty-five or 24 million people\" are \"out of work or stopped looking for work.\"",
        "doc": "Super Tuesday is only one month away, which means the GOP presidential hopefuls are descending on Georgia to convince voters they deserve Barack Obama\u2019s job.And speaking of jobs, they\u2019re hammering Obama on unemployment.When Republican front-runner Mitt Romney stumped at an Atlanta custom countertop showroom Wednesday afternoon, he said that \"25 or 24 million\" people are \"out of work or stopped looking for work.\"A PolitiFact Georgia team member stood among the crowd of 300, Truth-O-Meter in hand. It lit up and told us that Romney was doing a new take on an old talking point.Last month, during the Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Romney said that \"we have 25 million Americans out of work\" during the Republican presidential debate. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National ruled his statement Half True.Does Romney\u2019s revised statement earn him higher marks on the Truth-O-Meter?First, let\u2019s look at his statement from January.Officially, there were about 13.1 million unemployed Americans in December 2011, which put the unemployment rate at 8.5 percent. This is according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s source of employment statistics. Romney\u2019s count was some 12 million higher.Here\u2019s why: When PolitiFact National analyzed Romney\u2019s statement, they pointed out that certain critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting. It doesn\u2019t count people who have stopped looking for work or are working part time, even though they\u2019d prefer a full-time job.To address this concern, BLS offers an alternative measure (known to economists as \"U-6\") that includes these other groups.By this metric, an additional 2.6 million people in the U.S. were \"marginally attached\" to the labor force in December 2011, meaning they\u2019d be ready to work if a job became available. Another 8.1 million were working part time but would prefer a full-time job.Together, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in December 2011, for a total \"U-6\" rate of 15.2 percent -- well above the official unemployment rate. Romney\u2019s data was a little high, but in the ballpark.Romney earned a Half True. His use of the term \"out of work\" was a stretch when about one-third of the \"25 million Americans out of work\" are actually working part time, PolitiFact National ruled in January.Now on to Romney\u2019s statement in Atlanta.Romney described those \"25 or 24 million\" people as being \"out of work\" or having \"stopped looking for work.\"The newest jobs data shows Romney\u2019s calculation for the total number of unemployed, looking for work or are working part time, even though they\u2019d prefer a full-time job, remains more or less accurate.In January, some 12.8 million people were unemployed and 2.8 million people were marginally attached to the labor force, according to BLS figures. An additional 8.2 million were working part time even though they wanted a full-time position. Once again, that totals 23.8 million.But Romney\u2019s latest description of these workers was a little off the mark.The BLS describes \"marginally attached workers\" as people not in the labor force who want to work and are available to do it, and who have looked for a job in the past 12 months, but had not done so in the past four weeks.These people want work, but have recently given up because they have family obligations, think they can\u2019t get a job, or other reasons.The BLS calls people who are working part time even though they\u2019d prefer a full-time job as working \"part time for economic reasons.\" This is defined as those who worked one to 34 hours a week because they can\u2019t find full-time work or business has slowed down.The BLS does not ask whether they stopped looking for work.Of the 24 or 25 million workers mentioned by Romney, only 15.6 million clearly match his description as being \"out of work\" or having \"stopped looking for work.\"The remaining one-third may or may not be angling for more hours or a full-time slot at their current employer. They could have stopped looking for full-time work altogether. We don\u2019t know.Romney\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but he gets important details wrong. He therefore earns a Half True.",

        "doc": "Since Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, numerous false claims have continued to circulate claiming vote counts in battleground states were fraudulent.An Aug. 3 post asks people to act on these claims and send postcards to five battleground states where Biden won in 2020. The post claims doing so will lead state officials to \"decertify\" the election results.\u201cSend your postcards to 5 key states to decertify fraud TODAY,\u201d the post reads. It also includes a graphic urging people to stop states from destroying ballots, a common practice for practical reasons, state officials say.The post, which garnered more than 450 shares in three weeks, was shared by Janet Porter, who recently lost a Republican congressional primary in Ohio. The post references attempts to decertify results in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.But decertifying election results is not possible, experts agree. Election results from the five states were certified shortly after the 2020 election and have been repeatedly confirmed as legitimate.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksUSA TODAY reached out to Porter and the website linked in the post for comment.According to experts and state officials, there is no legal basis for decertifying election results.\u201cDe-certification is not a legitimate process,\u201d said Sophia Solis, deputy communications director for the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s office. \u201cUnder state law, the Arizona Secretary of State has a non-discretionary duty to canvass the statewide election returns as provided by the counties and has no authority to change vote totals or reject the election results. The same applies to the Board of Supervisors who canvass and certify the county election results. Second, sending postcards to state officials does not decertify election results. Decertification is not a thing.\u201dRepresentatives from other states said likewise.\u201cSending postcards will not decertify the election,\u201d said Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office, in an email to USA TODAY.Riley Vetterkind, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said there is no statutory provision for decertifying a Wisconsin election. And Amy Gulli, director of communications for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said there is no validity to the claim.The Michigan Secretary of State's office did not respond to requests for comment.Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency before then-President Donald Trump fired him, explained this in a 2021 tweet.\u201cWhen you see someone say 'decertify,' ignore them. There is no mechanism for such a thing under the law,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: you\u2019re the mark. They want your money, they want your rage, they want you turning out, protesting, & threatening officials. You\u2019re a pawn. Nothing more.\u201dThe Facebook post links to a website from the America Project, which is run by Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of Overstock who donated millions to help fund the independent audit in Arizona.Fact check: How we know the 2020 election results were legitimate, not 'rigged' as Donald Trump claimsThe website tells people to send mail to Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan.2020 election results have been certified in all those states, according to news reports. Biden won in each state, and these results have been affirmed through several processes.In Arizona, an audit performed by Maricopa County and an independent audit by a firm hired by the state Senate confirmed the state's election results. In Georgia, three audits found no evidence of wrongdoing that affected the state's election outcome. In Michigan, state officials audited ballots and voting machines and corroborated Biden's win. An audit in Pennsylvania found \"strong evidence of the accuracy of the count of votes,\" according to a press release from the state. In Wisconsin, recounts in two of the state's largest counties found no evidence of widespread fraud, and an audit authorized by the state's lawmakers of voting machines and an investigation by a conservative law firm found the same.The website urges people to send postcards because the \u201cballots in the 2020 presidential election are scheduled to be destroyed on September 4.\u201d It references the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which requires election officials to retain ballots for 22 months.This law was originally intended to maintain ballots in case they needed to be investigated for allegations of voting discrimination, according to PolitiFact, which also debunked the claim. Once the 22 months is up, states are no longer obligated to keep ballots. Officials in Milwaukee County, for example, discard ballots due to lack of space.\"Imagine trying to store all those pieces of paper for an extended period of time \u2013 we would run out of room,\" Michelle Hawley, director of Milwaukee County Election Commission, told PolitiFact.Arizona\u2019s state law requires state officials to keep the ballots unopened and unaltered for 24 months unless a court orders them to be opened, according to Solis.Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that sending postcards to key states will lead to decertifying ballots. Once election results are certified, it is not legally possible for them to be decertified, according to experts. Decertification is not a real process. All 2020 election results have been certified in the five key states mentioned on the website linked to the post, and an array of audits and reviews have found them to be legitimate.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

        "claim": "Says Donald Trump will be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021.",
        "doc": "After President Joe Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, defying the predictions of QAnon supporters, some adherents of the conspiracy theory began to claim that his predecessor, Donald Trump, would actually be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021. In recent weeks, social media posts have echoed this theory in posts. \"The Constitution of the United States had established March 4 as Inauguration Day. Trump will be our 19th president soon,\" reads one from Feb. 23 on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The advent of that date and mounting concerns about potential violence have led Washington, D.C. law enforcement to beef up security around the Capitol. During a hearing with defense officials, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., announced that 5,000 National Guard officers would remain in D.C. through March 12 out of fear that the online chatter around the date would translate into real-world violence. \"Some of these people have figured out that apparently 75 years ago, the president used to be inaugurated on March 4. Okay, now why that's relevant, God knows,\" Smith said. Why does this date have relevance for some QAnon supporters? And how do their claims stack up against the evidence? U.S. presidential inaugurations were originally held on March 4. Although not specified in the original text of the Constitution, the precursor body to the U.S. Congress picked March 4 as the date that it handed off power to the new government. The 12th Amendment officially set the date as March 4. And in 1933, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution changed the inauguration date to Jan. 20 in order to shorten the presidential transition. But some QAnon adherents maintain that the 20th Amendment was never adopted and that any president sworn in on Jan. 20 is not a legitimate president, said Travis View, a disinformation researcher and host of the QAnonAnonymous podcast. Their reasons for believing this are complex, but the general idea rests on a misreading of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, also titled \"An act to provide a government for the District of Columbia.\" According to Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University, the act consolidated the different neighborhoods of Washington into a single governing entity called a municipal corporation. However, some QAnon adherents believe that the statute effectively dissolved the U.S. government and turned the entire country into a business. Adherents of this theory believe all laws passed after 1871 are illegitimate, including the 20th Amendment, and all presidents since Ulysses S. Grant have held office illegally. As a result, some adherents maintain that Trump will return on March 4, the original inauguration date, and be sworn in as the 19th president of the restored United States. There\u2019s no validity to the theory. The Organic Act of 1871 didn\u2019t incorporate the entire United States. \"None of (the Organic Act) has anything to do with the rest of the United States, or the validity of any constitutional amendments or laws enacted after 1871,\" said Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University. The belief that Trump will be re-inaugurated on March 4 is controversial within the broader QAnon community, View noted, saying that all of the high-profile QAnon influencers he is aware of have pushed back on the March 4 date. \"They\u2019re calling it a false flag operation,\" View said. A Facebook post says Donald Trump will be re-inaugurated as president on March 4, 2021. This conspiracy theory rests on a flawed interpretation of an 1871 bill that consolidated the different neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., into a single entity. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution changed the inauguration date from March 4 to Jan. 20. And on Jan. 20, 2021, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president for a term of four years. This claim is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire! \u200b",

        "claim": "In late March 2021, Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith expressed the opinion that voting on Sunday is wrong because it\u2019s the Sabbath and dedicated to God.",
        "doc": "As Senate Democrats forged forward on a voting rights bill, titled \u201cFor the People Act 2021,\u201d in late March, they faced fierce opposition from Republicans. On March 24, 2021, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer criticized state legislatures for working on laws that he argued would disenfranchise Black voters, specifically by limiting voting on Sunday, a day when churches with majority Black congregations host events like Souls to the Polls. He received a rebuke from Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, which soon went viral. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Georgia says voting on Sunday is wrong because it\u2019s the Sabbath, dedicated to God. Better cancel football and baseball, then. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 24, 2021 In the above tweet, author Stephen King incorrectly said Hyde-Smith is a Georgia senator, when in fact, she represents Mississippi. But on March 24, 2021, Hyde-Smith did express the sentiment in so many words that states should not hold voter events on Sunday because it is the Sabbath. She was responding to Schumer, who had criticized Georgia lawmakers for attempting to suppress early voting on Sundays, which would specifically affect Black communities whose churches have a history of using Sundays to encourage voters to cast their ballots. Schumer said: \u201cWhy did the Georgia legislature only pick Sundays to say there should be no early voting on Sunday? We know why. It\u2019s because that\u2019s the day African Americans vote in the \u2018Souls to the Poll\u2019 operation where they go from church to vote. It\u2019s despicable.\u201d Later, during a Senate Committee hearing, Hyde-Smith said she wanted to address Schumer\u2019s comments. Her full remarks: Senator Schumer\u2019s question was, he was wondering why on Sundays, Georgia would not participate in an electoral process of gathering signatures of registration and things on Sunday and I would just like to respond to that. Georgia is a southern state just like Mississippi. I cannot speak for Georgia, but I can speak for Mississippi on why we would never do that on a Sunday or hold an election on a Sunday. [Holds up a dollar bill] You know this is our currency, this is a dollar bill. This says, \u2018The United States of America In God We Trust.\u2019 Etched in stone in the U.S. Senate chamber is \u2018In God We Trust.\u2019 When you swore in all of these witnesses, the last thing you said to them in your instructions was, \u2018so help you God.\u2019 In God\u2019s word in Exodus 20:18. it says remember the Sabbath, and keep it holy. So that is my response to Senator Schumer. Schumer responded that observing the Sabbath on Sundays is not, strictly speaking, biblical, if one is citing the Old Testament as one\u2019s source. \u201cI\u2019ll start by reminding my colleague of the separation between church and state,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor, \u201cand frankly, the Bible passage she talked about comes from the Old Testament when the Sabbath was on Saturday.\u201d Indeed, Jews still observe the Sabbath on Saturdays, as do Seventh-Day Adventists and several other Christian denominations. Hyde-Smith made her remarks around 25 seconds into the video below: She clearly stated that Mississippi would not hold election events on Sundays because of the Sabbath, and that the day should be devoted to God. Since this debate, legislators in Georgia backed down on restricting early voting on Sundays. The current version of legislation now requires that during the three-week early voting period in the state, counties would be required to offer early voting on the two Saturdays in that period, and makes it optional on Sundays. While Hyde-Smith did not explicitly say the words paraphrased in Stephen King\u2019s tweet, she expressed the same sentiment. We rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d",

        "claim": "In the stimulus, \"$15 million dollars went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, population 165.\"",
        "doc": "In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent. \"I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there\u2019s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money,\" Obama said. \"And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked.\" On the same day Obama made his speech, House Republican Leader John Boehner issued a press release saying the stimulus is \"chock-full of wasteful government spending.\" And he attached a list of 19 \"real world\" examples. We looked at several of the items on this list to see if they were as billed. Here, we will examine the claim that \"$15 million (in stimulus) dollars went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, population 165.\"This project landed in the national spotlight when it was singled out in a CBS Evening News report on July 13, 2009. \"That's roughly $90,000 dollars per resident,\" the report said.\"Consider that Los Angeles International doesn't have the money to install critical taxiway warning lights,\" the CBS report states. \"And a third of the nation's largest airports -- 11 of the 30 biggest, handling over one-fourth of the nation's passenger traffic -- have substandard safety areas for when planes veer off the runway.\"A lengthier story three days later in the Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror included some defense of the project. To put the project in perspective, some locals said, you have to understand Ouzinkie, and the importance of air travel. Ouzinkie is a small, island village peopled predominantly by Native Alaskans called Alutiiq.Or as ProPublica.org put it in an article titled Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus: \"The village of Ouzinkie is one of the remotest outposts in the United States \u2014 home to a mere 165 people on an island off another island off the coast of Alaska. There are no stores, no gas stations and no stoplights.\"Because of its remoteness, villagers depend on its airport as a lifeline for mail, medical evacuations and supplies. The location of the existing airport, local officials told the Kodiak Daily Mirror, is exposed to fierce crosswinds that often make it impossible for planes to take off and land, and the site does not meet FAA-mandated runway length. The new project includes a runway, taxiway, airport lights, a snow removal equipment building and 2 miles of access road. \"I\u2019m sorry the airport has to cost so much, but essential services are essential air services,\" Ouzinkie Vice Mayor Tom Quick told the Kodiak Daily Mirror. \"They are essential, whether you\u2019re talking about five people or 5,000.\"Quick also said planes have been much more convenient in transporting the dead, who otherwise were transported via skiff. \"I feel this is very necessary in case somebody needs to get a medevac out,\" added Jill Boskofsky, vice president of the Ouzinkie Tribal Council and environmental director. \"I feel it's for the safety of our community.\"In an opinion piece for the Anchorage Press, Krestia DeGeorge called the CBS report \"sensationalizing\" and told people to \"quit picking on Ouzinkie.\" Airports in Alaska are a more important part of the basic transportation system than they are elsewhere, she wrote, and, \"The point is that we should think carefully about what\u2019s really involved before criticizing something. ... Otherwise (things) such as Ouzinkie\u2019s lifeline will continue to be someone else\u2019s taxpayer waste.\" On this one, Boehner has his facts straight. It's worth noting that the one-sentence synopsis of the project leaves out important contextual information, such as how important a lifeline an airport is to this small island community. But Boehner is right. And so we rule his statement True.",

        "claim": "\"In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations.\"",
        "doc": "This year\u2019s primary elections are getting so nasty that Lithonia Congressman Hank Johnson has taken to calling them \"slimary\" elections.In an op-ed on liberal website \"The Huffington Post,\" Johnson, a Democrat, blamed the viciousness on super PACs, political fundraising organizations that can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions alike. \"In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations,\" Johnson wrote in the Feb. 24 article.Those are some big bucks, wealthy people, and generous businesses. We wondered if Johnson got his numbers right.Super PACs became legal after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision. They are an object of ire for those who think they can be used to buy elections and help donors obscure their identities. A Johnson spokesman said the congressman got his data from articles in Politico and Roll Call. The stories, which ran Feb. 8, lay out the findings of \"Auctioning Democracy: The Rise of Super PACs & the 2012 Election.\"The report was authored by left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. It argued that super PACs skew American politics by giving outsize influence to wealthy donors who hold views that do not represent those held by the broader public.Johnson\u2019s account matched both news accounts\u2019 descriptions of the \"Auctioning Democracy\" report. One of these descriptions could have been more precise, but they were not unreasonable.From the advent of super PACs to the end of 2011, donors have contributed a total of $181 million in what are called \"itemized individual contributions\" to super PACs, the report states. These are contributions from donors who give more than $200. Super PACs must report donor names once their contributions pass this threshold.The report did not tally contributions by small donors, said Adam Lioz, a Demos official and an author of the report.Demos and U.S. PIRG found that 196 people donated $100,000 or more to super PACs, which is just shy of 200 individuals. Calling them \"super-rich\" is polarizing, but it\u2019s reasonable to assume that people who can afford to make a $100,000 donation have unusually high incomes.We used the report\u2019s findings to calculate that donations of the \"super-rich\" amounted to about 43 percent of total contributions. This is some 7 percentage points lower than the \"roughly half\" figure that Johnson used.For-profit businesses contributed 17 percent of itemized donations, the report states. This is just shy of the 20 percent Johnson cited.We checked with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for more transparency in government. It is the source of much of the data used in the report, so we wanted to get the organization\u2019s take on the numbers. A spokesman said they found no problems with the conclusions of \"Auctioning Democracy.\"But for the sake of due diligence, we compared the report\u2019s numbers to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics, which keeps a rolling tally of super PAC contributions on its website OpenSecrets.org.The data from the CRP and the \"Auctioning Democracy\" report are not easy to compare. They track contributions over different time periods, and the CRP tallies a broader pool of contributions.However, we felt an analysis of the CRP data would give us a rough sense of whether Demos and U.S. PIRG overstated their results to make their case.First, we looked at the CRP\u2019s count of total super PAC donations.From 2010 to late February, about $215 million had been donated to super PACs, according to the CRP data. This is about $35 million -- or 20 percent -- more than the data published in \"Auctioning Democracy,\" but this difference did not signal major flaws.The CRP\u2019s number should be significantly higher than the figures in \"Auctioning Democracy.\" The report excludes donations of $200 or less as well as contributions for the 2012 calendar year. The CRP includes them.Next, we looked at whether \"roughly half\" of super PAC donations came from 200 \"super-rich\" people. The CRP publishes a list of the top 100 super PAC donors for the 2012 election cycle on its website. We found they donated about $74 million so far, or 57 percent of the cycle\u2019s $130 million total.The count in \"Auctioning Democracy\" was lower, which suggests that Demos and U.S. PIRG did not overstate the significance of donations from the \"super-rich.\"We had difficulty using the CRP\u2019s data to check corporate or business donations. The CRP\u2019s Web page lists too few organizations, and does not distinguish between for-profit businesses and groups such as labor unions or advocacy organizations.Our rulingJohnson wrote that \"[i]n the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations.\"On balance, Johnson\u2019s claim reflects the findings of a report by two advocacy groups that are critical of super PACs. The statistics Johnson uses also make sense in light of data published by a separate group.We give Johnson a True.",

Whipped cream will be gone in South Korea from January 1 2021. It makes me so sad. Every time I go to cafes, I always have my coffee with whipped cream, but now I won't be able to do that!\" A similar claim was also shared on Naver here and here and on Facebook here, here, here, here and here. The claim is false. South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced on September 21, 2020, a new regulation that requires cafes to use high-pressure gas cylinders, instead of nitrous oxide cartridges, in order to charge whipped cream dispensers. The cylinders must contain more than 2.5 litres of nitrous oxide, the ministry said in a statement. The new rule, which came into effect on January 1, 2021, is designed to prevent abuse of nitrous oxide cartridges, it said. \u201cSince 2017, there have been cases that people consume nitrous oxide as hallucinogenic through carbon monoxide-inflated balloons, locally known as \u2018Happy Balloons\u2019, and it has become a social issue,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cIt turned out many people got hold of nitrous oxide through a nitrous oxide cartridge, which is easy to purchase online and carry around. So that we have decided to ban the use and distribution of it. \u201cFrom January 1, 2021, coffee shops and cafes are not allowed to use or stockpile nitrous oxide cartridges.\u201d The ministry emphasised that the change would not affect the quality of the whipped cream. Ahn Sang-hyun, a Seoul-based cafe owner, told AFP the impact of the government\u2019s new rule would be insignificant. \u201cProviding whipped cream to customers is one of the essential services, but there are many alternative ways to do so apart from using a nitrous oxide cartridge and whipped cream dispenser, such as using store-bought whip cream products,\u201d he said during a phone interview on December 31, 2020. \u201cAs far as I understand, not many individual and small-sized coffee shops rely on a nitrous oxide cartridge to produce whipped cream due to its cost and need for a frequent refill.\u201d",

        "doc": "A graphic circulating on Facebook (FB) falsely claims Vice President Leni Robredo has spent half a billion pesos in campaign ad expenses. The erroneous image first appeared last December on FB page Tamaraw News, which neither cited its source nor substantiated the claim. The text in the graphic reads: \u201cGUMASTOS NG KALAHATING BILYONG PISO SA ADVERTISEMENT PERO PAMBILI NG SARDINAS AT BIGAS PARA SA BIKTIMA NG BAGYO HUMIHINGI NG DONASYON ([Robredo] spent half a billion pesos on advertisements but begs for donations to buy sardines and rice for the victims of the typhoon).\u201d The graphic made the rounds during the time Robredo visited the regions devastated by Typhoon Odette to check the situation on the ground and asked netizens for donations. There are no official documents, statements or news reports saying the vice president has spent P500 million in campaign ads for this election where she is running for president. Campaign spending of election candidates is reported in their Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) that is submitted in full 30 days after the elections as required by the Section 107 of the Omnibus Election Code. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) published a report more than a month ago detailing the campaign expenses of electoral aspirants on traditional media. The article mentioned that Robredo aired ads worth P120 million from January to September 2021, most of which were spent on radio. News5, on the other hand, reported last November that Robredo aired ads worth almost P4 million on her FB page from August 2020 to November 2021 based on the data from the FB Ad Library. As of Jan. 3, Robredo\u2019s official FB page has spent more than P11 million on ads related to social issues, elections or politics, according to the FB Ad Library. In the 2016 presidential election, several news articles, citing Robredo\u2019s SOCE, stated that she spent P418.66 million for her vice presidential campaign bid. Out of the total amount, P387 million was spent on political ads, according to another PCIJ investigative report. Apart from FB page Tamaraw News (created on March 18, 2016), the false post was also carried by The Bobomilyas (created on Feb. 22, 2018) and The Good Humans Club (November 2, 2012). It has collectively garnered more than 31,600 reactions, 10,400 comments and 11,000 shares. Have you seen any dubious claims, photos, memes, or online posts that you want us to verify?

        "claim": "Says the late Lady Bird Johnson sicced the CIA on actress and singer Eartha Kitt after Kitt spoke out against the Vietnam War during a White House luncheon in January 1968.",
        "doc": "During an episode of Comedy Central\u2019s \"Drunk History,\" comedian Nicole Byer described a conflict between the late Lady Bird Johnson and actress and singer Eartha Kitt when Johnson was first lady. During a July 2 episode, Byer said: \"Lady Bird calls the CIA and she goes, 'Yo listen, this b----? I don't like this b----. You better find everything you can about her so I can send it to other people so she doesn't work. Lady Bird is just like, \u2018Destroy her,\u2019 \" Byer said. We had to know whether Byer\u2019s description of Texas icon Lady Bird Johnson was accurate. Comedy Central did not return a request for more information, so we consulted archival news coverage and spoke with historians to check this claim. Kitt was one of 50 women invited to the White House on Jan. 18, 1968, for a \"Women Doer's Luncheon\" to discuss crime among young people, according to a Jan. 19, 1968, New York Times story. Johnson frequently recorded her thoughts and reflections throughout her husband Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency, according to the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum. A transcript from a Jan. 18, 1968, recording details the day of the luncheon. Other women in attendance included governors\u2019 wives, senators\u2019 wives, journalists, and members of the National Emergency Committee on the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, according to Johnson\u2019s audio diary. Both President Lyndon Johnson and the first lady were at the luncheon. When Kitt rose to speak, she offered a sharp condemnation of the Vietnam War, according to the New York Times story. In her audio diary, Lady Bird Johnson said that Kitt took a step toward her, \"looking with intense directness at me,\" when she offered her critique. \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed,\" Kitt said during the luncheon, according to the Times. \"They rebel in the street. They will take pot and they will get high. They don\u2019t want to go to school because they\u2019re going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.\" Johnson said Kitt\u2019s speech stunned the room into silence. Kitt wasn't the only entertainment icon to criticize the Johnson administration over the Vietnam War. Michael Gillette, a former historian at the LBJ Presidential Library, said journalist Walter Cronkite and actress Jane Fonda were among the public figures who spoke out against the war. Kitt\u2019s comments were well documented in the press, as they caused quite a commotion. An anonymous letter to the first lady on Jan. 22, 1968, included racist language about Kitt and said she \"defiled the White House and made us all ashamed.\" A woman named Clarence Nowack left a message for Johnson on Jan. 20, 1968, to say she was proud of her son for volunteering to serve in the war, where he was killed. Warren E. Burger, then a federal appellate judge who would be named a year later to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a Jan. 19, 1968, letter to Johnson that he and his wife were proud of how she composed herself during the luncheon. \"The unhappy episode at your recent luncheon impells me to write you to say that Mrs. Burger and I took a deep pride in the courage and composure you exhibited in the face of a gross breach of your hospitality and of good elementary manners,\" Burger said. A letter to the editor published on Jan. 27, 1968, in the Times said in part: \"There are even a few of us who believe that it is not really decent, or fair, to attack a man by insulting and humiliating his wife in the presence of other guests and the press.\" Kitt told the Times, according to a Jan. 23, 1968, article, that she had received telegrams, phone calls and mail from supporters who agreed with what she had said. Kitt later said in a June 7, 2006, video interview that she had not realized that the debacle at the White House affected her career until investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called her about the CIA\u2019s file on her. \"I didn\u2019t realize I was being rejected in the United States and I couldn\u2019t find work. I thought maybe my popularity is waning, my records sales are not up,\" Kitt said. Byer said Johnson asked the CIA to find damaging information on Kitt after the luncheon. We couldn\u2019t find evidence of this direct request. But the Secret Service did request information about Kitt from the CIA the day after the women\u2019s luncheon, according to Hersh's Jan. 3, 1975, story in the Times. Historians say it is unclear who directed the Secret Service to make the request. Secret Service officials said they asked the CIA for information on Kitt to see if she was a threat to President Johnson or others under their protection, according to the Times. The CIA gave a three-page report on Kitt to the Secret Service, a file the agency had maintained since at least 1956, because Kitt had done work overseas, the Times reported. The report stated that Kitt had a \"very nasty disposition\" and described her as \"being a spoiled child, very crude and having a vile tongue.\" We submitted an open records request to the CIA seeking the information in the report. The CIA responded: \"we did not locate any responsive records that would reveal a publicly acknowledged CIA affiliation with the subject.\" John Wilson, an archivist at the LBJ Presidential Library, said he doubts Lady Bird Johnson would have asked the CIA to investigate the star, and if she did, she would not have put it in writing. \"As far as actual power, first ladies don\u2019t have very much, but people would tend to listen, I would think,\" Wilson said. \"Whether or not she should or could ask is one thing, but if she did ask them informally, they would be a lot more likely to pay attention.\" Gillette said that Johnson would not have wanted to fan the flames around the Kitt incident. \"I knew her a long time and I knew a lot of people who knew her better than I did, and that\u2019s so out of character for her that it\u2019s almost laughable,\" Gillette said. \"Drunk History\" claimed former first lady Lady Bird Johnson demanded the CIA find damning information on singer Eartha Kitt. While the Secret Service did request information from the CIA following the luncheon, there is no evidence to support the idea that Lady Bird Johnson asked for the information. The Secret Service said the request was made for security purposes, not to \"destroy her.\" We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",

Choose your plan ArrowRight Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) is facing a tough challenge from Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley (R) to retain her seat in a Republican-leaning state. The ad above is part of an effort to suggest to voters that she has enriched herself at taxpayer expense, perhaps as part of the \u201cswamp\u201d culture decried by President Trump. This ad is slightly less blunt than a previous one that referred to \u201ca corrupt Washington subsidy\u201d (and was fact-checked by our colleagues at FactCheck.org). But it is equally misleading, throwing big numbers around without the necessary context. The Facts The key source for the ad is a July 24 article that appeared in the Kansas City Star headlined: \u201cBusinesses linked to McCaskill\u2019s husband get $131 million in federal dollars.\u201d The article said that the income from these investments by Joseph Shepard had \u201cgrown exponentially during his wife\u2019s two terms in the Senate,\u201d from between $1,608 and $16,731 in 2006 to $365,374 and $1,118,158 in 2017, according to federal disclosure forms, which show only ranges of income. Advertisement The \u201cup to $22 million\u201d figure is drawn from those disclosure reports, which indicate that Shepard\u2019s investments had earned between $5 million and $22 million over her time in office. Obviously, the NRSC emphasized the high-end figure. A casual viewer of this ad might come away thinking that McCaskill\u2019s husband personally got $131 million in federal subsidies and then kept (pocketed) $22 million. But that\u2019s not the case. Shepard is a founder of Sugar Creek Capital, which invests in low-income housing that receives subsidies or credits from federal and state governments. The federal subsidies are intended to cover the gap between the rent paid by the tenant and the market value determined by the federal government. The company received primarily rural rental assistance through the Agriculture Department, according to the newspaper. Advertisement As the Kansas City Star article made clear: \u201cThe federal payments don\u2019t go directly into Shepard\u2019s pocket. Most of the money goes toward operating costs for government-subsidized housing projects Shepard is invested in. Those companies then distribute the profits to Shepard and other investors.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that McCaskill played any part in directing federal funds to businesses affiliated with her husband.\u201d \u201cMcCaskill\u2019s husband is a limited partner in the vast majority of the housing projects that receive federal funds, meaning that he isn\u2019t responsible for day-to-day operations and has no say in the distribution of profits, which is limited by law.\u201d The Star article is essentially an update of an Associated Press article that appeared during McCaskill\u2019s last campaign, in 2012. That article said Shepard \u201creceived almost $40 million in federal subsidies for low-income housing developments during her first five years in office, though it appears only [a ] fraction of that has made it to the family\u2019s bank accounts.\u201d Her opponent in that campaign also tried to make an issue of the subsidies, but the attack fell flat as she cruised to victory. Now the line of attack has been revived in a tougher campaign year for her. The Star article noted that McCaskill and her husband had a net worth of $13 million and $29 million in 2006 and reported a net worth of between $31 million and $37.5 million in 2017. An NRSC official defended the ad, noting that the income Shepard earned from these types of investments skyrocketed during his wife\u2019s Senate career and that the subsidy money goes directly to the companies he owns, not to the tenants. \u201cThe ad doesn\u2019t take a stance one way or the other about whether McCaskill personally directed money his way, just that during her time in office this is what came his way,\u201d he added. The Pinocchio Test Regular readers know we often warn that the best thing to do when an attack ad airs on television is to mute the sound. But, of course, that doesn\u2019t necessarily stop the images from seeping into your mind. Advertisement Unlike the first version of this attack, with its blunt use of the word \u201ccorrupt,\u201d this ad skates a little more closely to the edge. The numbers that flash by are real, but the implication that McCaskill is getting rich at voters\u2019 expense is false. The ad says McCaskill\u2019s husband \u201creceived\u201d $131 million, when, in fact, the subsidies, intended to help low-income people afford housing, did not go directly to him. Because this attack did not move voters in 2012, Republicans should retire this smear campaign and move on toward a debate on the issues. The NRSC earns Three Pinocchios.

        "claim": "Says \"566,000 crimes\" were \"made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years.\"",
        "doc": "Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, seeking re-election,entered 2018 by warning on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page that \"criminal aliens\" committed more than 500,000 Texas crimes in recent years. We wondered about Patrick\u2019s declaration in part because we\u2019d just found scant data about Texas crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States. Also, research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data suggests that nationally, unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes. For that other fact-check, we calculated from annual state-posted crime reports that the 170,000 arrests of \"criminal immigrants\" proclaimed by a Texas House member at a 2015 hearing represented about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish that percentage as a fact. Here\u2019s Patrick\u2019s statement on Facebook, which he presented against the backdrop of a wire fence: \"566,000 crimes made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years.\" We took that to mean that \"criminal aliens\" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes over six years. Then again, text in smaller print to the right of Patrick\u2019s fence-backdropped statement offers a different interpretation. That text says: \"In the past six years, criminal aliens have been charged with more than 566,000 crimes in Texas including kidnapping, homicide, burglary, and much more. There is no excuse for endangering our communities by allowing criminal aliens who have committed a crime to go free.\" Some perspective: We estimate, starting from Texas Department of Public Safety annual crime reports for 2011 through 2016, that there were 5,513,663 adult criminal arrests in the state in the six-plus years referenced by Patrick. If the 566,000 figure offered by Patrick solely reflects arrests, he was referring to about 10 percent of adult arrests in the state. Patrick points to state-posted figures We asked Patrick, a Houston Republican who touts his support for a secure U.S.-Mexico border in a fresh video ad, about the basis of his 566,000 \"crimes made\" statement. A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, replied by email: \"We have answered this question many times.\" Garcia provided a link to a familiar DPS web page, \"Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens:\" SOURCE: Web page, \"Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens,\" Texas Department of Public Safety, undated (accessed Jan. 23, 2018) Adding up the chart\u2019s tallied arrests, covering 11 crime categories, gets you to 638,411 arrests \"associated with criminal aliens.\" And did all those arrests occur in the six-plus years noted by Patrick on Facebook? Not so. A related DPS web page noted by Garcia, \"Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,\" says that according to Department of Homeland Security \"status indicators, over 240,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017. During their criminal careers,\" it says, \"these criminal aliens were charged with more than 638,000 criminal offenses.\" We read \"criminal careers\" to refer to the booked individuals\u2019 lifetime rap sheets. More from the DPS page about those \"career\" arrests: \"Those arrests include 1,300 homicide charges; 76,044 assault charges; 18,126 burglary charges; 76,660 drug charges; 774 kidnapping charges; 43,591 theft charges; 49,154 obstructing police charges; 4,180 robbery charges; 6,878 sexual assault charges; and 9,561 weapon charges.\" Unmentioned in that text: 352,143 of all the tallied arrests, 55 percent, were for \"all other offenses,\" according to the DPS. According to DPS criminal history records, the agency says, those 638,000-plus criminal charges \"have thus far resulted in over 286,000 convictions.\" The conviction count presented on the chart offered as Patrick\u2019s backup indicates 286,101 convictions. The DPS page says the convictions break out to 547 homicide convictions; 28,592 assault convictions; 8,915 burglary convictions; 37,581 drug convictions; 268 kidnapping convictions; 19,803 theft convictions; 24,084 obstructing police convictions; 2,153 robbery convictions; 3,164 sexual assault convictions; and 3,973 weapon convictions.\" Its text on the web page doesn\u2019t mention the 157,021 included convictions for other offenses accounting for 55 percent of the total convictions. We spotted a couple other wrinkles. DPS\u2019s web page indirectly reminds that a \"criminal alien\" isn\u2019t necessarily someone living in the country without documentation. \"Of the total criminal aliens arrested in that timeframe,\" the page says, \"over 160,000 or 66% were identified by DHS status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their last arrest.\" We noticed too that the DPS doesn\u2019t specify how many of the noted arrests or convictions through criminal careers tie to the 160,000-plus people believed to be living here illegally at the time of their latest arrest. Our requests to the DPS to corroborate Patrick\u2019s 566,000 figure didn\u2019t yield additional information. Our ruling Patrick said that \"566,000 crimes\" were \"made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years.\" We didn't finda factual path to this figure and, in fact, spotted no state-posted information specifying a relevant count of criminal arrests or convictions for the six-plus years singled out by Patrick. The DPS has said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions were accumulated through their \"criminal careers\" by more than 240,000 \"criminal aliens\" booked into Texas jails in the six-plus years. Unsaid: Some of those people were living in the U.S. with legal authorization. We find Patrick\u2019s statement inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",

The headline read, \"Bill Gates is Buying Hundreds of Burned Up Lots in Maui for 'Pennies on the Dollar.'\" The story said that Gates was purportedly targeting affected areas in Lahaina to execute his plans: First, there was Oprah and The Rock and their obvious ploy to shoulder the general public with the burden of helping people while they head off to find new prime land with nothing but what used to be a home or business on it. According to reports, Bill Gates is in on the action, buying \"hundreds of burnt-out houses at pennies on the dollar.\" Gates says he's hoping to grab enough parcels to have the southern end of Lahaina rezoned commercial so he can put a \"global facility\" in Hawaii that will \"spread Microsoft and Gates Foundation services to the far east.\" In other words\u2026China. However, this item about Gates and the Maui fires was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The Dunning-Kruger Times is under the umbrella ofAmerica's Last Line of Defense, a network of content that'sdescribedon the Times' website as containing \"parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\" Any users who continued to read the article to the end would have found that it poked fun at readers who believed the story was true. For further reading, the article's mention of entertainment icon Oprah Winfrey and actor The Rock creating their People's Fund of Maui was a subject we previously reported about as being rife with misinformation.

        "claim": "Several brands of baby wipes available in the U.S. were recalled in 2017 because they pose a risk of serious infection.",
        "doc": "On 11 February 2017, a web site operating under the names \u201cHealth and DIY Tips\u201d or \u201cDaily Tips\u201d falselyclaimed that several brands of baby wipes were recalled in January 2017, and that the products posed a serious risk: Ten brands of baby wipes produced by the Pennsylvania-based Nutek Disposables, Inc., were recalled on January 25, 2017, following complaints of foul odor and discoloration. Upon further testing, the baby wipe and adult washcloth manufacturer discovered that some of their products contained Burkholderia cepacia, a species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria frequently found in soil and water, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Known for its vinegar-like odor, B. cepacia has emerged as a human respiratory pathogen in people with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease, especially cystic fibrosis patients. Pulmonary infections involving these bacteria are capable of causing accelerated decline in lung functions and can induce \u201ccepacia syndrome,\u201d a progressive form of pneumonia that can be fatal and untreatable, according to MicrobeWiki. The site specifically saidthat the wipes were recalled on 25 January 2017, but itscontentclosely matched an October 2014 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) press releaseabout to an obsolete butnearly identical recall: Nutek Disposables, Inc. of McElhattan, PA has initiated a nationwide voluntary product recall at the retail level of all lots of baby wipes that it manufactured under the brand names Cuties, Diapers.com, Femtex, Fred\u2019s, Kidgets, Member\u2019s Mark, Simply Right, Sunny Smiles, Tender Touch, and Well Beginnings, because some packages may contain bacteria. These wipes were distributed by Nutek prior to October 21, 2014 to the following retail stores: Walgreens, Sam\u2019s Club, Family Dollar, Fred\u2019s, and Diapers.com. After receiving a small number of complaints of odor and discoloration, Nutek conducted microbial testing that showed the presence of a bacteria, called Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia), in some of these products. Soon after, on October 3, 2014 the company initiated a voluntary withdrawal of lots that had tested positive for the bacteria, as well as other baby wipes in the surrounding time frame. After some additional lots were tested, as a precautionary measure, Nutek believed it was a prudent decision to withdraw all its baby wipe products. On Twitter, Sam\u2019s Club (a retailer mentioned prominently in the claim) repeatedly promoted baby wipes in February 2017. No mention of any sort of recall was made in 2017 or 2016 by the account; in 2015, the brand advised a customer that there was no baby wipes recall: @SarahRaphael At this moment there is no active recall for Member\u2019s Mark baby wipes. Thank you for asking and have a great day! \u2014 Sam\u2019s Club (@SamsClub) July 10, 2015 The Consumer Product Safety Commission did nothave any January 2017 wipes recall notices on its site. A wipe warmer was recalled in August 2016, but the notices were clearly unrelated to the claim of a January 2017 baby wipes recall. We contacted Nutek on 1 March 2017, and a company representative described the circulating baby wipes recall rumor as simply a scam. No recall notice was distributed by Nutek about several brands of baby wipes in January 2017, and the wording for the viral rumor appears to have been stolenfrom an October 2014 Food and Drug Administration press release and updated just enough to ensure clicks and shares on social media.",

        "claim": "Indian football team had to play the 1948 Olympics match with France on barefoot as the Nehru Government couldn\u2019t provide shoes for the team",
        "doc": "Following the FIFA\u2019s recent ban on All India Foodball Federation, a Facebook post is being widely shared claiming that Nehru Government was responsible for the Indian Football\u2019s present situation as he was unable to provide even shoes for the team at 1948 London Olympics. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Indian football team had to play the 1948 Olympics match with France on barefoot as the Nehru Government couldn\u2019t provide shoes for the team. Fact: Majority of the Indian football team members played the 1948 Olympic match barefoot as they were not used to playing with shoes. The shoes given by the AIFF were not usually used by the members of the Indian team except in wet and slippery conditions. This is the reason because of which in the 1948 London Olympics match, only a few played in shoes. Also, France won against India in that match 2-1. The captain of the team was Talimeran Aao, not Shailendra Nath Manna. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE. We performed reverse image search of the viral photo, and found it on \u2018Sportskeeda\u2019 website and \u2018Getty Images\u2019 Website. According to them, the photo was taken when Indian Players were walking out at Ilford for their match against France in 1948 London Olympics and majority of them were bootless. Taking cue from this, we searched further and found a relevant article on The Hindu\u2019s \u2018Sport star\u2019 website. According to this article, \u201cBeing largely unused to playing in them, the (Indian) players kept the boots supplied by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for occasions when the wet and slippery English conditions left them with no alternative but to wear them\u201d. Also, as claimed in the post, we found a photo of Nehru coming out of plane with his dog on \u2018Times content\u2019 website. The description of the photo says, \u201cPrime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru with his Pet Dog \u2018Pepi\u2019 at the Palam airport in New Delhi destined for Kulu-Manali on January 1, 1961\u201d Did the Indian football team have shoes at the 1948 Olympics? BBC\u2019s 1948 Olympics handbook shows that football matches in the 1948 Olympics were held in a knockout manner. In the official 1948 Olympics report, it can be seen that the Indian football team was out of the Olympics after losing to France in the very first match they played. In the 1948 Olympics report, it can be read that nine members of the Indian team played in the India-France match without wearing shoes. It can be read on the \u2018Sportstar\u2019 website that the Indian team was not in the habit of playing in shoes and that the shoes given by the AIFF are not usually used by the Members of the Indian team except in wet and slippery conditions. The photos of a few Indian players wearing shoes at the India-France match can be seen here, here, and here In the book \u2018Nation at Play: A History of Sport in India\u2019, it can be read that Indian players had a habit of playing without shoes, and that playing so contributed to their skill, and until about 1952, players played in international tournaments without shoes. It can be seen on the AIFF website that shoes were made mandatory in domestic competitions in 1954. Here, here, and here, one can see Indian players playing without shoes even in practice during 1948. On playing without shoes, 1948 Indian football captain Talimeren told the media, \u201cIn India, we play football, whereas you play bootball!\u201d, the Olympic channel website reported. Also, as claimed in the post, Shailendra Nath Manna was not the captain in this match. Talimeran Aao was the captain. Was India banned in 1950 FIFA world cup because they were playing barefoot? We searched the internet with relevant keywords and found related articles Los Angeles Times and Scroll. According to these articles, AIFF just did not take the World Cup seriously, considering the Olympics to be the ultimate goal, is backed up by Sailen Manna, who would have been the captain of the team. As he told Sports Illustrated, \u2018We had no idea about the World Cup then. [H]ad we been better informed, we would have taken the initiative ourselves. For us, the Olympics was everything. There was nothing bigger.\u2019 The All India Football Federation (AIFF) announced that the team would not attend the World Cup, citing \u2018disagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time.\u2019 To sum it up, Indian football team was provided shoes during 1948 London Olympics, but out of habit, majority of players played barefoot. Also, India was not banned in 1950 FIFA world cup for playing barefoot.",

        "doc": "\"BREAKING: Nuclear plant explode due to #earthquake in #Turkey,\" says a February 6, 2023 tweet sharing the video, which received more than 370,000 views. The same visual appeared alongside similar captions on Twitter, TikTok and other platforms. A 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southeast Turkey at approximately 04:17 am (0117 GMT), the biggest disaster to hit the country since 1939. More than 5,000 people have died in Turkey and neighboring Syria, and tens of thousands more are estimated to have been injured. But the video circulating online does not show the disaster, as one user who shared it later acknowledged. \"Update : This footage is from Beirut 4th august 2020 explosion,\" said \"CBKNEWS,\" the Twitter account that shared the February 6 post, in a follow-up tweet. The account is verified because it pays for Twitter's subscription service, according to its profile. A reverse image search confirms the clip matches footage of the blast that rocked Beirut, Lebanon's capital and largest city, on August 4, 2020. News organizations such as Sky News, CBS News and The Guardian published the same footage. The explosion destroyed Beirut's port and wiped out neighborhoods, killing more than 200 people and wounding 6,500 others. The blast was not nuclear, however. It was triggered by a fire in a warehouse that detonated hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, a material in fertilizers, that had been stored for years. AFP has previously debunked other examples of footage from Beirut being misrepresented, as well as posts sharing images unrelated to the recent earthquake in Turkey.",

        "claim": "\"Nearly 20 million Americans ... have gained health insurance since (the Affordable Care Act) passed in 2010.\"",
        "doc": "With the battle over the Affordable Care Act continuing in the courts, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., took to Twitter to argue that millions of Americans have benefited from the law. Manchin wrote, \"Let\u2019s be clear: throwing out the #AffordableCareAct without a plan in place would be horrific for West Virginians and Americans with preexisting conditions, and the nearly 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance since the law passed in 2010.\" Let\u2019s be clear: throwing out the #AffordableCareAct without a plan in place would be horrific for West Virginians and Americans with preexisting conditions, and the nearly 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance since the law passed in 2010. pic.twitter.com/vCO7BgBPqQ Have nearly 20 million Americans gained health insurance since the law\u2019s passing? We took a closer look. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-rofit that focuses on health care policy, has published data through 2017 that sheds light on Manchin\u2019s statement. The foundation\u2019s data shows that since 2010, the number of Americans with health insurance has increased by about 35 million, an even higher number than Manchin cited. However, while the law passed in 2010, it didn\u2019t fully take effect until 2014, so the more accurate year to use as the baseline is 2013. However, the data still supports Manchin\u2019s claim. In fact, he undershot the actual number. Since 2013, about 26.6 million people have gained health insurance. It\u2019s worth noting that the Affordable Care Act, while a major factor in this increase, is not the only one. As the Baby Boom generation ages, more and more Americans transition into guaranteed health care under Medicare -- about 10,000 a day. Because of this, some previously uninsured people would suddenly be counted as being insured upon turning 65. For this, they have Medicare to thank, rather than the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the continuing economic recovery played a role in expanding the pool of insured people, by increasing the number of Americans who were employed and who, as a result, were able to secure health insurance through their employment. That said, there\u2019s little question that the Affordable Care Act played a role. Between 2008 and 2012 -- an equivalent five-year period before the ACA took effect -- just under 10 million people gained health insurance, a much smaller number than the 26 million between 2013 and 2017. Manchin tweeted, \"Nearly 20 million Americans ... have gained health insurance since (the Affordable Care Act) passed in 2010.\" From 2013, the year before the law took effect, to 2017, the number of Americans with health insurance rose by 26.6 million, meaning that Manchin actually understated the gains. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that gains in Medicare and from employer-sponsored health care account for a portion of that increase, so the increase can\u2019t be credited entirely to the Affordable Care Act.

To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Blue Cross Blue Shield is an association of 35 independent U.S. health insurance companies. The association does not provide bonuses for vaccinating a set number of child patients. \"Every (Blue Cross Blue Shield) company sets its own value-based contracts with local providers,\" said a Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson. \"The purpose of any performance-based incentives, where they exist, is to reward implementation of well-established evidence-based best practices in the care of our members. While vaccinations may fall into that category, they would not be the sole performance measure. Any incentives cover a broad collection of best practices.\" \"As always, decisions around whether to vaccinate ultimately rest with the provider and the patient (and) parent,\" said the spokesperson. Childhood vaccines are considered standard medical practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics \"strongly recommends immunizations as the safest and most cost-effective way of preventing disease, disability, and death.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also encourages parents to immunize their children against preventable and potentially life-threatening disease, providing a schedule of standard vaccinations given to children starting at birth and going up to age 18. Blue Cross Blue Shield chief medical officer Vincent Nelson told Lead Stories, \"Physicians (and) providers can be incentivized through their work with independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, but the implication in this post that physicians (and) providers pursue childhood vaccinations solely for financial reasons is false.\" We rate this claim False.",

The news clip identifies the person as Deepak Goyal, who works for the same news organisation and even published the image of the person. Through this article let's fact-check the claim made in the post.Claim: Newspaper clipping about a man not passing stool for 25 years. Fact: The viral clipping was first released by the local newspaper 'Kashi Vaarta' in Varanasi. This news article was originally published in 2017, specifically for entertainment purposes on the occasion of Holi, and it does not depict any real incident. Further, according to experts it is not possible to live without having a bowel movement for so many years. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.There is no such disease called Luteo Cristo Diphallia:The widely circulated newspaper clipping claims that a man did not pass stool for 25 years due to a condition called Luteo Cristo Diphallia. However, internet search did not yield any results or information regarding such a disease.Diphallia is a rare genetic condition that occurs when a male baby is born with a duplication of the penis. According to the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), Diphallia or penile duplication is a rare congenital variant with an estimated frequency of 1 per 5 to 6 million live births. Further, Diphallia has nothing to do with digestive health (passage of stool), as mentioned in the viral clipping.Moreover, according to experts, it is probably not possible to live without having bowel movements for so many days. Thus, the lack of supporting evidence suggests that the viral story may not be based facts.The viral clip is a satirical piece:Further search led us to a news report that debunked the viral clip. As per this report, this viral clip originated from a local news agency in Varanasi known as 'Kashi Vaarta'. The editor of this news agency has provided clarification, stating that the viral clip was initially published in 2017, on Holi and explicitly mentioned that the news was not factual, but rather intended for entertainment purposes.In addition, the report includes an interview with Jaya Prakash, the individual featured in the viral news clip, who is employed at 'Kashi Vaarta'. During the interview, he clarified that he does not suffer from any such ailment and emphasised that his image was used solely for entertainment purposes.To sum it up, an old satirical newspaper clipping that was originally published for entertainment purposes is now being shared as a genuine one.",

White House pool reporters were not allowed to cover the visits. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said that the administration didn\u2019t want to turn the visit into \u201ca photo op.\u201d Instead, White House photographers covered the events in a series of photos and a video later shared by Trump\u2019s social media team: We love you Dayton, Ohio! pic.twitter.com/IaCZAdyuzL \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019 Websites and viral social media posts began running with a rumor that the nurses and other hospital staffers pictured in photographs with the president during his visit to Dayton were not actual hospital employees. The DC Tribune ran a story with the headline \u201cDayton Hospital Insider Says Many Of The People Who Posed With Trump During Photo-Op Were Not Actually Hospital Employees.\u201d That article, like nearly every viral social media post making the same claim, cites as the sole source of that information a Georgia man who, in a series of tweets, claimed that a \u201cfriend who knows a nurse\u201d at the hospital in Dayton (Miami Valley Hospital) told him that the photos showed non-employees, strongly suggesting \u201cfake nurses\u201d were used for the shots. Though he was directing his comments in response to a specific photo shared by another Twitter user, his claim broadly concerned the general existence of non-employee nurses during the visit in general: We reached out to Ghalili, the Georgia man, to ask if he could provide any corroborating evidence for this rumor. In a lengthy email reply, he told us \u201cI personally can not corroborate [my friend\u2019s] nurse friend\u2019s comments\u201d: As I stated I got a text from a friend actually a former employee who indicated that a nurse friend of his told him that many of the people including those in nurses uniforms did not work at that hospital and she did not know where they came from. After I tweeted this and received tweets back as to the claim I reached back to my friend, he did not know I had tweeted his remarks but was ok with it. I asked him if he or his nurse friend would be willing to go public. He said no way and for obvious reasons and requested i don\u2019t disclose his name. I don\u2019t know the identity of the nurse and was not about to ask him. The only thing he said that knowing her she has no reason to make up something like this. He added his personal view that \u201cI don\u2019t put [it past] Trump\u2019s aides to have staged this. As his visit to both hospitals were controversial.\u201d He told us that a reporter should be able to get to the bottom of it. We reached out to officials at the Miami Valley Hospital, sending them the video of Trump\u2019s Dayton visit and asking if any unknown non-employee nurses appeared in any that video. In response, Ben Sutherly, a spokesman for Premier Health and Miami Valley Hospital, told us that \u201cI can confirm that those were Miami Valley Hospital employees.\u201d That video, at 0:18 seconds, captures the same group of people in the photo that inspired Ghalili\u2019s tweet. Further, Snopes has identified several Miami Valley employees whose photographs appear in unrelated press reports about the hospital who also appear to have been shown in photographs during Trump\u2019s visit. We have reached out to one of those individuals, but have received no response. All told, this claim has its origins in one man with no direct connection to the hospital. Based on the lack of corroborating evidence, the apparent presence of previously documented Miami Valley Hospital nurses in some of the photos, and confirmation from the hospital that everyone in the video produced by Trump\u2019s team was, in fact, an employee, we rank the claim \u201cFalse.\u201d",

        "doc": "West Bengal was gripped with violence soon after the ruling TMC won the third term in the assembly elections. The violence allegedly took the lives of at least 12 people, five claimed to be BJP supporters and five others said to be from the TMC. While the State is gripped with post-poll attacks across political parties, a disinformation war has been waged on social media. Photographs of a woman allegedly raped and murdered in Pingla, West Medinipur district has been widely shared online with the claim that she was a BJP worker. Prashant Patel Umrao, a vocal supporter of the Bharatiya Janata Party, shared her pictures. It is noteworthy that Indian law prohibits disclosing the identity of victims of sexual violence. BJP MP Saumitra Khan wrote in Bengali, \u201cHathras had political juice. Not Medinipur? Where is the elite class of Kolkata and where are your candles?\u201d Khan also shared a picture of people protesting the woman\u2019s rape and murder. Former ABVP state organising secretary for Central India Vijay Athwal alleged that the woman was a BJP Mahila Morcha worker.

Rathaur wrote that the incident hasn\u2019t been highlighted because the victim doesn\u2019t hail from the minority community. This slideshow requires JavaScript. It has also been shared with a message in Tamil. Fact-check The incident has been reported in regional media and none of the articles states that the woman\u2019s rape and murder was linked to the post-poll violence in West Bengal. According to TV9 Bangla, the woman was found in a half-naked state in an under-construction house behind her residence. Her undergarment was tied around her neck. Three masons, including a woman, working on the under-construction house have been arrested by the police. The incident took place in Pingla\u2019s Jamna village. Bangla News Live reported that the woman\u2019s father and cousin found her body. It quotes the woman\u2019s aunt accusing the masons of the crime. The police arrested three people \u2013 Belda (Medinipur) resident Bikas Murmu (27), Jharkhand resident, Chotu Munda (35) and Tapasi. The men allegedly gang-raped and murdered the woman while Tapasi guarded the door. West Medinipur SI Sankha Chatterjee told Alt News that the social media claim linking the incident to post-poll violence is false. \u201cThree people have been arrested, including a woman who helped in the construction work of a house behind the deceased\u2019s kaccha house. They were appointed by the family. The accused have confessed to the crime,\u201d he said. The uncle of the victim told Boomlive that she wasn\u2019t a BJP worker. Hindustan Times Bangla reported that the woman was 21 years old and a student in Debra College. Her body has been sent for autopsy, the report added. The incident was also reported by Sangbad Pratidin and The Kharagpur Post. The rape and murder of a woman in West Medinipur has been linked to post-poll violence in West Bengal, despite local reports, the woman\u2019s family and the police denying that the crime was politically or communally motivated.

The heated exchange drew the attention of social media users, one of whom posted what they described as a \"fact check\" of Biden. \"Joe said 14,000 people died from H1N1. Fact checking it is 574,000,\" the post reads. This post, which has been shared over 3,500 times, misleadingly implies that Biden drastically understated the number of H1N1 deaths. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the U.S. in the spring of 2009, and eventually spread around the world. It was initially called \"swine flu,\" because it carried genes similar to influenza viruses in North American pigs. The post cites an estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of how many people H1N1 killed worldwide. During the debate, Biden was clearly citing the number of people who died from H1N1 in the United States, comparing it with the number of Americans who have died from the coronavirus under Trump\u2019s watch, which now stands at nearly 211,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. What\u2019s more, in his debate remarks Biden actually overstated the number of swine flu deaths in the U.S. while he was vice president. The CDC estimates that 12,500 Americans died from H1N1 between April 2009 and April 2010. A Facebook post reads, \"Joe said 14,000 people died from H1N1. Fact checking it is 574,000.\" The post cites the number of H1N1 deaths worldwide. The context makes clear that Biden was citing the number of H1N1 deaths in the U.S. We rate this Pants on Fire!",

        "doc": "The U.S. Constitution established the Electoral College system to select the nation's president and vice president, involving 538 electors who cast the critical ballots.The system has always generated debate, particularly among those wanting a more straightforward popular vote. But some social media users say abolishing the Electoral College would give Los Angeles an outsized impact on the race for the White House.\"This should scare you,\" reads a Facebook post shared July 18. \"Abolishing the Electorial (sic) College makes Los Angeles stronger than 43 states.\"The post was shared more than 800 times in less than two weeks. Similar posts have amassed hundreds of interactions on Facebook.But the implied claim here is false.Election experts told USA TODAY that if the Electoral College were abolished, it would likely be replaced with a nationwide popular vote, in which one person gets one vote. The amount of influence accorded to Los Angeles in that system depends on how one defines the geographic area, but no definition of the relevant area would make the claim true.USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.Kristine Bezdecny, a geography professor at California State University, Los Angeles, told USA TODAY that people tend to be vague about which \"Los Angeles\" they are referring to, as was the case with the Facebook post.However, there are generally three main regions \"Los Angeles\" could refer to: the City of Los Angeles; Los Angeles County; and the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, which typically refers to Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to Bezdecny.If the Electoral College was abolished, the population of any particular region, whether a state or a city, would be irrelevant, assuming a system of nationwide popular election was substituted, James Gardner, an election law expert at the University of Buffalo School of Law, told USA TODAY in an email. In such a system, the president is directly elected by the people and each person gets one vote.Fact check: No, sending postcards to state officials won't decertify 2020 election resultsSo really the claim is just that \"Los Angeles\" is larger than 43 states. Let's check the numbers on that.The City of Los Angeles' population was about 3.9 million in the 2020 Census, which exceeds the population of 22 individual states, said Robert Speel, a political scientist at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College.Fact check: No evidence Trump said anyone under FBI investigation is not qualified to be presidentLos Angeles County, the largest county in the U.S., was home to about 10 million people, according to the 2020 Census. It exceeds the population of 40 states, Speel said.And the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area had a population of 18.6 million in the 2020 Census. That exceeds the population of 46 states, Bezdecny said. Only California as a whole, Texas, Florida and New York are larger. (This ranking would be unchanged if we considered the Census-defined Los Angeles Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a 2020 population of 13.2 million.)Based on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the implication that abolishing the Electoral College makes Los Angeles \"stronger\" than 43 states. The post doesn't spell out which Los Angeles area it is referring to, but the 43 states stat is wrong in any case. The city and county of Los Angeles have too few people for this to be true, and the metropolitan area is larger than that, outranked by only four states \u2013 one of which is California as a whole.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

The video in question doesn\u2019t appear to be an actual campaign advertisement, but rather an unofficial fan video. Facebook did previously remove campaign ads by Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in June 2020 for violating the platform\u2019s policy against organized hate. The ad contained a symbol used by the Nazis to identify political prisoners in concentration camps. We sent questions to both YouTube and Facebook asking whether any actions have been taken against the video. A spokeswoman for YouTube said she was \u201cunaware of any forthcoming action.\u201d We didn\u2019t hear back from Facebook before publication.

        "claim": "Germany has not reduced emissions in the past decade despite spending $580 billion on renewables.",
        "doc": "Germany has set ambitious targets for reducing fossil fuel emissions, but energy shortages and rising power prices have led some to question the success of the country\u2019s efforts. A Facebook post (screenshot here ) on June 20 claims Germany spent $US580 billion on renewables over the past decade but achieved \u201czero emissions reductions\u201d. The claim is false. The $US580 billion figure is a projection for a longer-term transition away from fossil fuels and does not accurately reflect the country\u2019s spending on renewables. Data shows German greenhouse gas emissions dropped about 17 per cent over the past decade. The Facebook post used a screenshot of a February 2019 tweet by American author and environmental commentator Michael Shellenberger , founder and president of Environmental Progress , a pro-nuclear group. His 2019 tweet states: \u201cGermany spent $580 billion on renewables over the last decade and got: zero emissions reductions; 50% increase in cost of electricity; electricity supply 2x more carbon-intensive as France\u2019s; electricity nearly 2x expensive as France\u2019s.\u201d Mr Shellenberger removed the tweet after being contacted by AAP FactCheck earlier in the year. However, screenshots of the tweet have been widely shared on Facebook, as seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . The claim was wrong when Mr Shellenberger originally published the tweet and remains false. Data from the German environment agency shows that from 2009 to 2018, the decade prior to Mr Shellenberger\u2019s tweet, German greenhouse gas emissions fell from 903 million tonnes to 851 million tonnes , a drop of 5.8 per cent (sheet \u2018THG\u2019, row six). Using June 2022 as the end point for the decade in question, the same data shows emissions fell from 917 million tonnes in 2012 to 762 million tonnes in 2021, a fall of 17 per cent. Jorn Gierds, a scientific advisor at the German National Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech), confirmed Germany\u2019s emissions decreased in the decade prior to Mr Shellenberger\u2019s tweet. \u201cGermany\u2019s emissions (measured in CO2 equivalents) decreased between 2009 and 2019 from about 902.7 m tonnes to 799.7 m tonnes,\u201d Mr Gierds told AAP FactCheck in an email. \u201cIn 2020, we saw an even sharper decline of emissions in Germany. This led to Germany achieving its climate targets set for 2020 (reduction of emissions by 40 per cent compared to 1990). However, the emission-reducing effects of COVID-19 need to be taken into account for this particular year.\u201d Katharina Hartz, a project officer at think tank Agora Energiewende , told AAP FactCheck the claim is wrong and Germany\u2019s trend towards reducing emissions has been clear over many years. \u201cGermany reduced its greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2021 by around 40 per cent,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn the last decade (between 2010 and 2021), it reduced emissions by about 20 per cent.\u201d Mr Shellenberger\u2019s claim Germany has spent $US580 billion on renewables over the last decade is also incorrect. In his tweet, Mr Shellenberger links to a 2018 Bloomberg News article about Germany\u2019s climate targets, which reported that Germany was spending 500 billion euros or $US580 billion to \u201coverhaul its energy system\u201d. The Bloomberg article does not provide a source for the figure. However, other articles (such as here , here and here ) link to a 2016 German study that said the total cost of Germany\u2019s energy transition in the electricity sector \u201cwill amount to over 520 billion euros by 2025\u201d. Ms Hartz said if Mr Shellenberger\u2019s claim was based on the Bloomberg article, \u201cit is wrong in the sense that overhauling the energy system is not equal to subsidies for renewables\u201d. Miriam Borgmann from acatech told AAP FactCheck the Bloomberg article was \u201ctalking about the costs for the whole energy transition, not only renewables\u201d. Germany\u2019s transition away from fossil fuel would also include costs for refurbishing houses to make them more energy-efficient and charging stations for electric vehicles, Ms Borgmann said in an email. According to the environment agency\u2019s \u2018 Renewable energies in Germany \u2013 Data on development in 2021 \u2018 report, 149 billion euros was invested renewable energy plants between 2012 and 2021 (page 22, table 5). The Verdict The claim Germany has not achieved any reduction in emissions despite spending $580 billion on renewables over the last decade is false. The $US580 billion figure is a projected estimate for the cost of the country\u2019s entire energy transition by 2025. It is also incorrect to claim German greenhouse gas emissions have not fallen. Emissions decreased 5.8 per cent in the decade up to the end of 2018 and by 17 per cent in the decade up to June 2022. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network .

        "claim": "\"When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits.\"",
        "doc": "On a number of occasions, Rick Santorum has used speeches to tout the theme of self-reliance and limited government, including one claim about government programs at the time his grandfather immigrated to the United States. Here\u2019s an excerpt from his Feb. 29, 2012, speech near Knoxville, Tenn.: \"Eight or nine months ago, President (Barack) Obama, responding to Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, gave a lecture on all these wonderful programs that Ryan was going to cut or change. Programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps and housing programs and Medicaid and Medicare. He listed them all. He said America is a better country because of these commitments. And then he read off his teleprompter, he said, \u2018I will go one step further. America was not a great country until these commitments.\u2019 \"So the president of the United States did not believe America was great until people came into power in Washington who raised your taxes, took your freedom and then redistributed your hard-earned dollars to someone that Washington believed deserved it more than you did. In his mind, that\u2019s the greatness of America. \"That\u2019s what makes America not different or great -- it makes it like every other country in the world. And by the way, all of us came from those countries because we didn\u2019t want those countries to take care of us. When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits.\" There\u2019s a lot to digest here, but we\u2019ll focus in this item on whether it\u2019s true that when Santorum\u2019s grandfather arrived in the United States in 1925, \"there were no government benefits.\" We contacted the Santorum campaign about this statement but received no response. But did hear from a dozen historians and economists and read a number of scholarly papers on the subject and found that the pre-1925 history of social welfare spending in the United States was complicated and nuanced. There were two major sources of payments to individuals prior to 1925 -- veterans benefits and workers' compensation. We\u2019ll take a closer look here: Veterans benefits: The federal government began funding benefits for Civil War veterans in 1862, initially based on a physical examination to determine the severity of a wartime injury. In time, however, the threshold for receiving a benefit was lowered -- first to less obvious wartime ailments, then to retroactive wartime claims that had never been previously been reported and then, in 1890, to servicemembers who had a disability not related to their military service. \"Pensioners and federal expenditures swelled after 1890, and the amount the government spent on pensions that year alone was $106 million,\" Peter Blanck and Chen Song wrote in a 2003 paper in the William and Mary Law Review. The 1890 Disability Pension Act, they wrote, was called the most expensive and liberal pension measure \"ever passed by any legislative body in the world\" at the time. The law was expanded further in 1904 through an executive order by President Theodore Roosevelt, defining \"disability\" to include old age, as long as the beneficiary had at least 90 days of service and an honorable discharge. Three years later, the 1890 law was replaced by a new one that granted pensions to veterans over 62, with increases in payments as they aged. \"In 1907, it was estimated that the 1890 Act had cost more than $1 billion,\" Blanck and Song wrote. \"Between 1870 and 1910, the proportion of veterans receiving pensions rose from 5 percent to 93 percent.\" A veterans\u2019 health system also began in the aftermath of World War I. This was not a trivial portion of the population. In a different paper, University of Arizona economist Price V. Fishback wrote that \"roughly 40 to 48 percent of the elderly in the North and Midwest in the early 1900s were receiving pensions\" through the system. This was such a significant group, Fishback wrote, that \"it likely altered the political calculus in ways that delayed the adoption of old-age assistance and pensions in the United States for a decade or two.\" The presence of federal benefits created, and reinforced, a broad interest group. \"At its height in the 1890s, the (Union veteran) pension scheme consumed almost half of the federal budget and was intimately linked to the Republican Party's strategy to maintain the soldier vote and hold the White House,\" Blanck and Song wrote, adding that \"it galvanized interests of the constituency of disabled (Union) veterans, who were increasingly important to the Republican and Democratic parties in the upcoming national elections.\" Worker compensation: A federal worker-compensation law to help civilian government workers injured or made sick on the job was adopted in 1908, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. Starting in 1911, states began passing such laws, and by 1929, laws were in effect in all but four states. Some states ran the compensation systems themselves, others required employers to pay into private plans, and some gave employers a choice between the two. While these are the clearest examples that run counter to Santorum\u2019s claim, there are a few other efforts worth noting. Local government aid to the poor: During the period Santorum is talking about, local governments were responsible for providing benefits to the poor, Fishback told PolitiFact. These payments tended to be modest. Fischback cited a study by Brendan Livingston of Rowan University that looked at welfare policies in Massachusetts -- generally considered the most generous state in the first decades of the 20th century -- and found that local governments were spending an amount equivalent to about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all income earned by state residents on relief for the poor. Private charities were spending at about twice that rate. By 1925, most states also had \"mothers' pensions\" on the books, which allowed widows to raise their children without having to put them in orphanages, according to Fishback\u2019s paper. By then, a handful of states also had means-tested pensions for the elderly, and a sizable number had pensions for the blind. And states or municipalities often operated mental hospitals, old-age homes, orphanages and general hospitals, all for the public benefit. \"The 1920s were years when state and municipal expenditures expanded rapidly and public and social services continued the professionalization that had started mainly after World War I,\" said Michael B. Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. Schools and universities: While education isn\u2019t a direct payment to individuals, it\u2019s worth pointing out that they represented a government-provided benefit in kind. \"Primary and secondary education were already overwhelmingly paid for by taxes from the late 1800s on,\" said Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis. Meanwhile, higher education had land-grant subsidies -- federally backed institutions dating back to the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. \"Because they were public institutions, tuition was cheaper on account of public subsidies,\" said Gary Gerstle, a historian and political scientist at Vanderbilt University. \"This was clearly a government benefit.\" Health funding for mothers and newborns. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act, which gave states matching federal funds to build and operate prenatal and child health care centers. The bill grew out of an investigation begun under President William Howard Taft, which found that \"nearly 80 percent of U.S. women did not receive proper prenatal care -- a fact starkly illustrated during World War I when thousands of men failed to pass their physicals due to afflictions stemming from inadequate medical care as children.\" Adding it up How much did such expenditures add up to? Researchers from the Urban Institute pointed us to old editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. One table shows a compilation for expenses for federal, state and local governments for selected years between 1902 and 1970. We chose 1922, the year closest to 1925, and found that the \"public assistance\" category amounted to $57 million, the \"other public welfare\" category totaled $71 million and \"veterans services otherwise not classified\" was $505 million. Combined, these three categories were 6.8 percent of expenditures at the three levels of government combined. Even if this overstates the amount, it\u2019s clear that the amount of government benefits was not zero. Santorum does have a point that social welfare spending by 1925 was relatively small compared to what it would ultimately become, because two major programs, Social Security and Medicare, didn't start until later. \"The most obvious feature of social expenditures at the turn of the 20th century was how much smaller they were in comparisons with the levels at the turn of the 21st century,\" Fishback wrote. As we noted in a previous fact-check of Santorum, federal entitlement programs have grown significantly, particularly after the establishment of Social Security in the 1930s and Medicare in the 1960s. In 1958, such payments accounted for 25.4 percent of the federal budget and grew to 65.1 percent in fiscal year 2011. This is not purely a result of policy decisions; it\u2019s also a result of technological advances and demographic trends. The cost of medical care has risen significantly over the years due to technology and advances in treatments (a topic we earlier discussed here), and the percentage of the population that is elderly has grown from 4.1 percent in 1900 to 12.2 percent in 2000. It\u2019s also worth noting that the specific individual Santorum cited -- his newly arrived immigrant grandfather -- wouldn\u2019t have benefited from military pensions or a land-grant college upon his arrival on these shores, and his ability to collect worker compensation would have depended on what state he lived in upon his arrival. Similarly, the local aid to the poor he would have qualified for would have varied significantly depending on what city or county he lived in, and it would have been small by the standards of later decades. \"I\u2019d go easy on Santorum for this one,\" said Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron. \"There wasn\u2019t much back then.\" \"Santorum is not alone in making these mistakes,\" Fishback told PolitiFact. \"I would bet that the vast majority of people including many social scientists do not know what our social welfare system looked like in 1925.\" Still, Aaron and Fishback are among many economists we contacted who were skeptical about the underlying message of Santorum\u2019s claim -- that life was better before the New Deal programs of the 1930s and the Great Society programs of the 1960s. Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, notes that inflation-adjusted per capita disposable income grew from $6,537 in 1929 to $32,659 in 2011 -- a fivefold increase. \"Life is unquestionably better, unless you think two-earner households, busy spouses, and dirtier homes are not worth SUVs, air conditioning, and weekend in Paris,\" said Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland. Our ruling Contrary to what Santorum said, millions of Americans in 1925 would have either qualified for benefits directly, such as payments to veterans, or have been protected by workers' compensation laws that provided benefits to those who became disabled by their jobs. And state and local governments had the longstanding role of paying support to people who were disabled or indigent. This provides a much more complex picture than Santorum is painting.

These missions involve overflight clearances from countries that are en route to the destination. The clearances for this HADR mission were sought for the standard routing which the IAF operators fly on a regular basis.\u201d An overflight clearance is an authorizations from the civil aviation authorities of a country to overfly or use that country\u2019s airspace. Alt News asked its source if any permission was sought from Pakistan. They said, \u201cNo permission was sought because Pakistan was not on the route. Thus, there is no question of Pakistan denying airspace to the IAF. It\u2019s worth noting that the IAF did not use Pakistani airspace during the 2021 Afghanistan evacuations as well.\u201d To sum it up, several media outlets reported that Pakistan had denied airspace to India\u2019s C-17 plane carrying relief aid. The IAF debunked this claim by stating that as per standard operating procedure, the route doesn\u2019t entail flying over Pakistan.

        "doc": " The Bharatiya Janata Party put out a misleading graphic on its social media channels quoting the International Monetary Fund. The IMF had released its World Economic Outlook Update, estimating that the real GDP growth for India in 2020 is -8%. However, the party's social media posts dropped the negative sign and projected India's growth for last year as 8%, higher than China's 2.3%, which was, in fact, the only country in the world to have shown positive growth in 2020, according to the IMF. Below is the graphic in question and here is an archived version of their Facebook post. The tweet has now been deleted and a fresh table reflecting the change has been put out. However, the party has not issued any regret for misinforming its followers earlier. The table created by the BJP, titled 'Indian Economy Rebounds', shows India leading the world in GDP growth in 2020 estimates and 2021 projections. The graphic also says that the IMF projects India as the only country to register double-digit growth in 2021. This part is true. The next highest real GDP project for 2021 is that of China at 8.1%. For India, the data and forecasts are presented on a fiscal year basis, with FY 2020/2021 starting in April 2020. India's growth projections are -7.6% in 2020 and 11% in 2021 based on the calendar year. IMF has said that India's forecast for 2021, which was made in October 2020, had to be revised from 2.7% to 11.5%, reflecting carryover from a stronger-than-expected recovery in 2020 after lockdowns were eased. The strength of the recovery is projected depending on access to medical interventions, the effectiveness of policy support, exposure to cross-country spillovers, and structural characteristics entering the crisis. While India's GDP projection for 2022 falls to 6.8%, it is still the highest that year among all the countries listed. GDP from 2011 onwards is based on GDP at market prices with the fiscal year 2011/12 as a base year. ",

        "claim": "U.S. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden does not support the set of climate change proposals set forth by other members of his party known as the \"Green New Deal.\"",
        "doc": "During the first 2020 U.S. presidential debate held in Cleveland on Sept. 29, Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he does not support the Green New Deal, a resolution introduced in Congress by members of his own party proposing strategies for dealing with climate change, but instead backs the \u201cBiden Plan\u201d for doing so, which is laid out on his campaign website. Biden\u2019s disavowal came on the heels of an attempt by his opponent, U.S. President Donald Trump, to tie him to the Green New Deal, claiming it would cost $100 trillion if implemented. Biden\u2019s responses (which begin one hour and 20 minutes into the below video clip) were as follows: \u201cThat is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cThe Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We\u2019re not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plants.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cNo, I don\u2019t support the Green New Deal. I support the Biden Plan that I put forward. The Biden Plan, which is different than what [Trump] calls the \u2018radical Green New Deal.\u2019\u201d These statements sparked criticism from Republicans like Omar Navarro, who ran three unsuccessful bids for California\u2019s 43d Congressional District in 2016, 2018, and again in 2020. On Sept. 30, Navarro shared a screenshot from Biden\u2019s website that described the Green New Deal as a \u201ccrucial framework for meeting the climate challenges\u2026\u201d The language in the tweeted screenshot above was indeed found on Biden\u2019s website as of Sept. 30, but was taken out of context and doesn\u2019t reflect the differences between the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal, which we will discuss below. The Green New Deal resolution was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Feb. 7, 2019, in response to Trump\u2019s 2017 announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. The 14-page proposal sets forth a number of policies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions produced by American companies, creating high-wage jobs for Americans, and to set an overall framework for environmental justice and resiliency against climate change-related disasters. It is important to note that the Green New Deal is nonbinding, and if it were to pass, nothing outlined within its pages would become law. Biden made climate change a cornerstone of his 2020 bid for the presidency, in turn criticizing Trump\u2019s handling of environmental affairs. It is true that the Biden Plan (archived here for reference) includes elements of the Green New Deal and is similar to it in that both plans agree that the U.S. needs to act urgently and epically to meet the scope of the climate change challenge, and that the environment and the economy are \u201ccompletely and totally connected.\u201d The Biden Plan addresses many of the issues outlined in the Green New Deal, with the addition of specific actions that a Biden administration would take should he be elected in November 2020. We dug through both proposals to understand the nuances between the two, where they differ, and where they are the same. Generally speaking, both policies establish a similar framework but differ in the specifics of how policymakers should go about enforcing and reaching defined goals. For example, both plans highlight the importance of clean, safe drinking water and community-driven projects that promote social and environmental justice in areas disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The greatest difference between the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal lies in their stances on the Paris Agreement, an international agreement established in 2015 with the central aim of coordinating and strengthening the global response to climate change and keeping the global temperature rise in this century below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Whereas the Biden Plan promises a recommitment to the Paris Agreement, the Green New Deal does not mention it at all. When it comes to clean energy, the Green New Deal and the Biden Plan are similar in that they aim to achieve 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions, but the former sets forth a 10-year mobilization deadline, whereas the Biden Plan sets a goal of no later than 2050. Both plans establish priorities for investment in clean energy innovation and research; however, the Biden Plan is far vaguer. The Green New Deal goes into greater detail, specifying that those investments should include infrastructure and industry, sustainable farming and land-use practices, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure, manufacturing public transit, removing greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and industry, and the research and development of new clean and renewable energy technologies. Other key areas of overlap between the two plans include creating resiliency across the nation and committing to international policy and trade that employ strong labor and environmental protections. According to his website, the Biden plan will be paid for by rolling back Trump tax incentives and will require a federal investment of $1.7 trillion over the next decade, leveraging the additional private sector and state and local investments to total more than $5 trillion. This estimated cost is significantly lower than the $100 trillion bill that Trump claimed the U.S. would foot during the debate. However, serious disagreement exists over how much implementation of the Green New Deal might actually cost. After its 2019 introduction by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Republican leaders and some media publications cited research by the right-wing think tank American Action Forum that speculated the Green New Deal could cost up to $93 trillion, or an estimated $600,000 per household, in its first 10 years. (A supplementary brief from the organization outlining the projected costs can be found here.) But a number of financial experts have countered that research, suggesting that it is more likely that the Green New Deal would cost significantly less, and in some estimates half as much. In fact, a September 2020 study published in the journal Energy Research & Social Science suggested a total overall cost of just over $16 trillion over 15 years. Though both the Biden Plan and the Green New Deal provide similar general frameworks for moving towards a cleaner economy and combating the effects of climate change at a national level, subtle differences exist between the two. Although Biden stated outright that he does not support the Green New Deal, it is apparent from his own policy statements that he supports elements of it that have been incorporated into his own plan. As such, we rate this claim as a \u201cMixture.\u201d",

        "claim": "If a lawsuit backed by Josh Hawley succeeds, \"nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage.\"",
        "doc": "In the closely watched U.S. Senate race in Missouri, Democrats have been going on offense over health care coverage. In a July 17 tweet, the Missouri Democratic Party trumpeted a lawsuit that was co-signed by Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, who\u2019s challenging the Democratic incumbent, Claire McCaskill. The Missouri Democratic Party tweeted, \"Instead of defending vulnerable Missourians, @HawleyMO is putting them at risk. If his lawsuit succeeds, nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage\u2014raising premiums for families across the state. #MOSen.\" Instead of defending vulnerable Missourians, @HawleyMO is putting them at risk. If his lawsuit succeeds, nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their healthcare coverage\u2014raising premiums for families across the state. #MOSen https://t.co/S6cTqrxzOV The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Texas on Feb. 26, 2018, was signed by 18 attorneys general and two governors, all of them Republicans. The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that \"the ACA is unlawful\" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation. If the plaintiffs\u2019 wishes are granted by the courts, then insurance companies would be able to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. So the tweet raises a genuine issue. However, we wondered whether the state party\u2019s estimate of \"nearly 2.5 million Missourians\" was accurate. Could that many Missouri residents really \"lose their health care coverage\" if the lawsuit succeeds? Not really. The tweet relied on one estimate. However, it\u2019s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower. Buckle up for a wonky ride! When we checked with the Missouri Democratic Party, they pointed to a report published in April 2017 by the liberal Center for American Progress. The group found that 2,495,800 Missourians are living with a pre-existing condition. This estimate leveraged the data in a broader study released by the Department of Health and Human Services in the waning days of the Obama administration. That study found that nationally up to 51 percent of non-elderly Americans have a pre-existing condition. (Americans age 65 and over are covered by Medicare, so they were excluded from the count.) Using Census data, the Center for American Progress took the HHS numbers and devised estimates for every state and congressional district. So the tweet used a real number, and one that experts said was legitimate. However, it\u2019s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower. For starters, the HHS study itself offered two definitions for \"pre-existing condition,\" and of those, the Center for American Progress chose the broader estimate. HHS\u2019s broader estimate tallied \"common health conditions \u2026 that could have resulted in denial of coverage, exclusion of the condition, or higher premiums for individuals seeking individual market coverage\" before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. By contrast, the narrower definition used by HHS only included conditions that would cause an applicant to be \"outright rejected for coverage by private insurers.\" The difference between the two estimates is not trivial. Under the narrow definition, HHS found, 23 percent of non-elderly Americans nationally have a pre-existing condition, while under the broad definition, 51 percent of non-elderly Americans do. That\u2019s more than double. Meanwhile, another independent estimate, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, mirrored HHS\u2019 narrower definition. The Kaiser estimate produced a figure for Missouri of about 1.1 million people. Emily Gee, the Center for American Progress health economist who worked on the report, said her group chose to highlight the broad definition \"because without the ACA\u2019s protections, people with pre-existing conditions may not be able to obtain comprehensive coverage if they ever needed to turn to the individual market because they could be rejected, be offered plans that exclude essential benefits, or be priced out of the market.\" Outside experts we contacted said that the Center for American Progress estimate has value. But they added that the tweet is a bit misleading in how it describes the group\u2019s numbers. First, while the tweet said that 2.5 million Missourians \"could lose their health care coverage,\" it would be more accurate to say that 2.5 million Missourians could either lose their health care coverage, or be forced into an exclusion (which would eliminate coverage for that condition, but not all coverage entirely), or see a rise in premiums. Each of these is a problematic outcome for patients, but they are not all identical to losing health care entirely, as the tweet framed it. Second, a large fraction of people with pre-existing conditions are insured through an employer or through Medicaid, meaning that they could not be denied coverage immediately after the lawsuit became successful and changed the law, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist specializing in health policy with the Rand Corp. Someone who currently has employer coverage or Medicaid would have to lose their existing coverage first even to be considered at risk for losing out due to the lawsuit. If they lost their current coverage and couldn\u2019t find other employer or government coverage, they would have to turn to the individual market. Only then could the lawsuit potentially have an impact on their insurance options. And that could play out over years, not immediately. The percentage of Missourians facing a more immediate risk to their coverage -- those who are already in the individual market for health insurance -- is about one-fifth as large as the figure cited in the tweet. According to the most recent figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 467,500 people in Missouri were insured on the non-group market -- the market that the Affordable Care Act opened access to, and, where the possibility of being denied or facing higher premiums for pre-existing conditions is the most acute. That\u2019s only 8 percent of Missouri\u2019s population. \"It\u2019s not right to say that the change leads to an immediate loss of coverage for 2.5 million people,\" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow with the Urban Institute. \"As with all these sound bites, they are a little loose with their wording for a wonk\u2019s taste.\" The Missouri Democratic Party said that if a lawsuit backed by Hawley succeeds, \"nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage.\" That figure represents the larger of two credible estimates.The alternative estimate is sizable -- 1.1 million people -- but it\u2019s less than half as large as the figure cited in the tweet. In addition, the tweet\u2019s description is incomplete. In reality, the 2.5 million figure includes people who would face premium increases and coverage exclusions, not just those who would lose coverage outright. It also encompasses many people who currently have employer-based coverage or Medicaid -- people who would not be at immediate risk of fallout from a successful lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.

Tammy Baldwin tried to poke holes in it. The Wisconsin Democrat is running for re-election in November 2018. Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson are seeking the Republican nomination to run against her. Baldwin, interviewed on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" claimed Trump\u2019s order \"doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families.\" In some respects, this is a fluid situation.

Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The order Families attempting to enter the United States without permission had been separated in the past, but immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. That changed in April 2018, when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings. Government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities. According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12. After an international outcry, Trump reversed himself and signed the executive order to end the practice of separating families. (Vukmir also shifted her position on separating families at the border, earning a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter.) The Trump order reiterates that the administration\u2019s policy is to \"rigorously enforce our immigration laws.\" It says in part: It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources \u2026 The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law \u2026.Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 (\"Flores settlement\"), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. So, to the second part of Baldwin\u2019s statement, the order does call for continuing to detain families -- though together, rather than separating parents from their children. But her use of the word \"jailing\" goes too far. The families, while kept in custody in some type of facility, would not be incarcerated in jails. The children already separated As for the 2,300 children already separated, PolitiFact National said it was not clear how or if the policy change might ultimately affect them. Initially, on the day of order, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said there would be no special effort from the Trump administration to reunite migrant families separated at the border. But later the same day, the department said the spokesperson had misspoken about the order. In a statement, the department said \"it is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter,\" but that \"reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of\" unaccompanied alien children \"and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody.\" In any case, the order itself does not address the 2,300 children. Moreover, Reyna Torres Mendivil, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, told National Public Radio that reunification would be hampered by the U.S. separation process, which keeps parents in federal custody while moving children into facilities controlled by the Department of Health and Human Services. \"The U.S. authorities create different files for the children than for the parents, and it's very difficult to follow up on those cases,\" Torres said. And CNN noted that separated children are in facilities or foster homes spread across states far from the U.S.-Mexico border, including Michigan, New York, South Carolina and more. The White House referred us to a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services, but we didn\u2019t get a reply. Our rating Baldwin says Trump's executive order \"doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families.\" The thrust of Baldwin\u2019s statement is correct. Federal officials in charge of reunification said after the order they \"are awaiting further guidance\" on how to proceed. But in fact the order does not address reunifying the 2,300 children with their parents, which is seen as a complicated process. The order also says, as Baldwin claims, that families entering the country without permission will continue to be detained \u2014 together, rather than parents and children being separated. But while the families would be in custody, at various facilities, Baldwin overreaches in saying the families would be put in jails. Baldwin\u2019s statement is accurate, but needs clarification \u2014 our definition of Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\"(Environmentalists) said \u2018We\u2019re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.\u2019 ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet.\"",
        "doc": "For years now, state legislators have been arguing over whether to prohibit \"mountaintop coal mining\" in Tennessee and the debate is likely to continue next year since the bill failed again in the 2012 session. In the Legislature's off season, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey spoke at a rally for coal mining supporters and criticized a central provision of the bill.\"(Environmentalists) said \u2018We\u2019re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.\u2019 ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet,\" said Ramsey, as quoted by the Kingsport Times-News at the Abingdon, Va., rally in early June.The Senate speaker has made similar comments in other discussions of the bill (SB577), which prohibits that state Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) from issuing any surface coal mining permits on a site above 2,000 feet in elevation.Where did that figure come from?Dawn Coppick, an attorney, who as legislative director of the Lindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship (LEAF), helped draft the bill and lobby for passage, says the 2,000-foot level is based on the U.S. Forest Service's classification of \"ecological subregions.\" That amounts to a distinct area, in effect counting as a mountain in Tennessee.Basically, everything above 2,000 feet on the Cumberland Plateau is deemed within such a subregion by the Forest Service and, thus, provides a \"scientifically sound rational basis\" for drawing a line, said Coppick. If the law were passed and challenged in court, judges would look to whether there is a \"rational basis\" for distinguishing one coal-bearing area from another, she said, and the \"ecological subregion\" would meet the legal criteria.The Ramsey remark suggests that the legislation, if passed, would effectively block coal mining in Tennessee because all coal is above 2,000 feet in elevation. Is that accurate?Well, no.Supporters of the bill, opponents of the bill and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation uniformly say there is lots of coal in Tennessee below the 2,000-foot elevation level. And there are maps that show it..A TDEC map of the state's coal-mining areas with the 2,000-foot elevation marked shows relatively small portions of the overall coal reserves would be included in the proposed ban. LEAF has a map on its website that is more generalized while making the point more clearly to the viewer.But Chuck Laine, president of the Tennessee Mining Association, says there's an underlying basis for Ramsey's comment in that the only marketable coal that can be gathered by surface mining is above 2,000 feet. A ban on mining above 2,000 feet, he contends, would have the practical effect of prohibiting surface mining in Tennessee.Coal is classified in different grades based on BTUs generated when it is burned, sulfur content, PH balance and moisture content.Currently, Laine said, the only marketable coal is that in the higher grades, known as \"thermal coal,\" which meets Environmental Protection Agency specifications for generating electricity in steam plants such as those operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\"We couldn't sell our lower-grade coal,\" he said. \"It's just not usable... For higher-grade coal, you have to go above 2,000 feet in Tennessee.\"Coppick, on the other hand, says she knows of no evidence to back up that assertion.Without getting into the merits of the legislation, it still may be appropriate to note the regulatory environment for coal mining in Tennessee. TDEC spokeswoman Meg Lockhart gave this explanation in an email:\"TDEC\u2019s authority at mine sites is limited to regulation of discharges and other impacts to waters, which the department controls through the use of permits issued under Tennessee\u2019s water quality law.The United States Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM) issues the permits for the actual coal mining operation. The federal SMCRA permit authorizes the mining of coal as well as the method or type of mining used.\"While OSM does allow mining companies to remove earth to reach coal seams, Tennessee does not allow mine spoil to be deposited in Tennessee streams as some other states do -- regardless of the ridge line elevation. Therefore, mountaintop removal mining is not permitted or practiced in Tennessee as it is in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia.\"Again, Tennessee water quality laws do not allow mining companies to fill valleys with the spoil as it would impair streams. Instead, this waste rock must be stored and returned to its approximate original contour. This mining method is called cross-ridge mining and the correct term for the activity allowed in Tennessee. Additionally, the spoil must be stored while the coal is removed, then replaced and re-vegetated once mining is complete. During this process, ponds must be engineered to capture runoff and control sedimentation.\"At present, TDEC has issued 30 permits for coal mining in the state but about half of them are apparently not in use with coal prices down from levels a few years back. The Knoxville office of OSM, in its annual report last year, listed 15 active Tennessee coal mines \u2013 five underground and 10 surface.While no breakdown of mine locations by elevation was available from TDEC, Laine says that all of the surface operations are above 2,000 feet.We invited Ramsey and his staff to defend or elaborate on his statement after explaining that it appears to be mistaken. There was no response.It appears the lieutenant governor has erroneously extrapolated from the coal industry's assertion that there is no marketable coal below the 2,000-foot elevation to declare there is no coal, marketable or otherwise, below that level in our state. We rate the statement False.",

        "claim": "\"Livestock today [accounts for] 4% of our agricultural GDP. It employs a few 100,000 people.\"",
        "doc": "In a TV interview, billionaire businessman Jimi Wanjigi quoted statistics that cast the economic management of current president Uhuru Kenyatta in a poor light. Wanjigi was right to say that debt repayments took 18% of revenue when former president Mwai Kibaki left office, and that GDP growth in 2007 was 7%. He was also correct that Kenyatta won the 2013 election by just 800,000 or so votes. But his claims about current debt repayments and growth under the Daniel arap Moi administration were exaggerated. Claims about the poverty rate were incorrect, and a claim about agriculture misleading. With less than a year to Kenya's elections, controversial businessman Jimmy Wanjigi discussed his presidential ambitions at length for the first time, on national TV . In the 29 August 2021 interview on Citizen TV , Wanjigi answered questions about his businesses, political history , subsequent fallout with the current government, and more. Kenya's general elections are set for 9 August 2022 . To make his case, Wanjigi cited statistics as evidence of the government's economic mismanagement.  We checked seven of his claims. We asked Wanjigi's office for the source of his figures. Spokesperson Isaac Njuguna said the claims were accurate and the data from the official Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . He also sent us the bureau's 2020 poverty report . In the interview, Wanjigi said debt repayments had drastically increased and were choking the country's business environment. He said the sharp increase had been in the last nine years of president Uhuru Kenyatta's government, a trend not seen under his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki . \"When Kibaki left power, of every KSh100 of Kenyan revenue collections, KSh18 went to [repaying] debt,\" Wanjigi said . Kibaki left office on 9 April 2013. Kenya's total public debt was then KSh1.8 trillion, according to data from the Central Bank of Kenya and the national treasury . The most recent data shows that by June 2021, this debt had grown to KSh7.7 trillion. To verify the level of debt at the end of Kibaki's term, John Kinuthia , a senior programmes officer at the Kenyan office of budget transparency think tank International Budget Partnership , advised us to check the treasury's annual debt management reports . The 2013 debt report says 18.7% of revenue went to repaying debt in the last financial year of Kibaki's term, ending in June 2013. \"Wanjigi's KSh18 figure out of every KSh100 for 2013 was not that far off,\" Kinuthia said. We therefore rate the claim as correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma We asked Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at Kenya's statistics bureau, where to look. He directed us to the treasury's public debt register . The most recent publicly available version is for the 2019/2020 financial year. This shows that at the end of the financial year, in June 2020, 41.4% of revenue was used to repay debt. The International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia said the data varied from year to year. For example, in June 2019 debt repayment took 58.8% of revenue. Even projections for debt payment in a financial year were different to what was actually spent, Kinuthia added. The Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that debt service for the 2020/21 financial year would be 66% of revenue, or KSh66 out of every KSh100. In 2020 the International Monetary Fund had a similar figure of 68% , but this year revised it to 47.6%. We have not seen any data that supports Wanjigi's claim that 75% of revenue currently goes to debt repayment, even if it is clear that since 2013, debt servicing has risen sharply. \u2014 Makinia Juma Mwai Kibaki took over from Kenya's second president, Daniel arap Moi, on 30 December 2002. For historical growth data, senior Kenya National Bureau of Statistics manager Benjamin Muchiri directed us to the bureau's annual economic surveys and to central bank data. The World Bank's data portal was also a good source, he said, as it is compiled from the national accounts of member countries. According to the bureau's economic surveys, Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.4% in 2002. The central bank had this at 0.5% , the same as the World Bank. GDP is a widely used measure of the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a specific period, usually a year. We found no evidence that Kenya had a negative growth rate in 2002. The data shows that while Moi's 24-year rule was marked by low growth , only 1992 saw economic contraction, at -7%. Wanjigi's claim is inflated, but the economy did grow consistently under Kibaki. \u2013 Dancan Bwire The economic survey data for 2010 shows growth in 2007 was at 7%. Kenya's central bank recorded 6.9%, as did the World Bank. The data shows consistent growth from 2002 to 2007. We therefore rate Wanjigi's claim as correct. In 2008 growth tanked to 0.2% following the global financial crisis and the effects of a disputed election , before rebounding to 8.4% in 2010. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Wanjigi's team attributed this claim to a 2020 report by the national data agency, which they shared with us. It was co-authored by UN Women and Unicef . But the agency does not compile annual poverty rate statistics, the International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia told Africa Check. Its most recent statistics were released in 2018 and have data for 2015/16. This data defines \"overall poverty\" as households and individuals whose monthly expenditure \"is less than KSh3,252 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh5,995 in core-urban areas\". It gives the national poverty headcount rate as 36.1%, a fall from the 2005/06 rate of 46.6%. When Kenyatta took office in 2013, the available data puts the poverty rate at 46.6%, 10 percentage points higher than the 36% Wanjigi claimed. Multidimensional index looks beyond income But is the current poverty rate 52%? We asked Paul Samoei, a senior manager for research and development at the Kenya statistics bureau who works on poverty data. He said t he index in the 2020 report was not a measure of the overall poverty rate. \"The multidimensional index looks beyond income to include access to safe water, education, electricity, food, and six other indicators,\" he said. A closer look at the 2020 report shows that it uses data from the 2015/16 survey. The statistics bureau also warns that the findings should be interpreted with caution, due to survey design limitations. Given these facts, we rate Wanjigi's claim as misleading. \u2013 Makinia Juma We asked Dr Timothy Njagi , a development economist and research fellow at the Tegemeo Institute , an agriculture policy think tank hosted at Egerton University , where we could find data to verify this claim. He directed us to the statistics bureau's economic survey. This shows that in 2020, animal production made up 3.6% of national GDP, not 4% of \"agricultural GDP\". Wanjigi seemed to have mangled his numbers, Njagi said. Does livestock employ around 100,000 people? There is no official data on the number of people employed in the agricultural sector because Kenya has never done an agricultural census, Njagi said. And most smallholder farmers practise mixed farming, engaged both in livestock and crop production. Double counting would therefore be a concern with any estimate, he said. \u2013 Dancan Bwire In 2013, Kenyatta narrowly beat Raila Odinga, an outcome the opposition leader unsuccessfully challenged in court . Wanjigi said he ran a tallying centre that confirmed Kenyatta's victory. He said : \"Kenyatta won that election. Didn't you see the difference in votes? The difference was 800,000 votes. I believe the competitors went to court and what happened? They lost.\" Chris Kerkering is litigation manager at the Katiba Institute , a nonprofit organisation that promotes knowledge of the constitution and its use in society. For a candidate to be declared winner of a presidential election in Kenya, they must have 50% plus one vote in their basket. \"The candidate also has to have 25% of the votes in each of more than half of the counties cast in their favour,\" said Kerkering. He pointed us to the electoral commission 's data for the 2013 elections, which shows that Kenyatta narrowly pipped Odinga by a slim margin, winning 50.07% of the vote. The data shows Kenyatta got 6,173,433 votes, and Odinga 5,340,546 \u2013 a difference of 832,887 votes. The claim is therefore correct. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi",

        "doc": "In an infographic published by the government on the 48-months portal, there are three claims relating to education in the country. This article is a fact check of the claims. In an infographic published by the government on the 48-months portal, there are three claims relating to education in the country. This article is a fact check of the claims. How many new educational institutions have been established? The first claim of the government is that numerous universities, 7 IITs, 7 IIMs, 14 IIITs, 1 NIT, 103 KVs and 62 Navodaya Vidyalayas have been established and have started functioning. The annual report of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (2016-17) states that there were only 20 universities and 500 colleges at the time of independence. These numbers have increased to 799 (as of 31st March 2016) in the case of the universities and 39,071 in the case of colleges. In the case of IITs, establishment of 5 new IITs, one each at Jammu, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala was announced in the budget speech of 2014-15. Establishment of an IIT in Karnataka and conversion of ISM Dhanbad into an IIT was announced in the budget speech of 2015-16. As far as IIMs is concerned, according to the MHRD website, there are 19 IIMs as on October 2018. Of the 19 institutes, 5 have been announced in the budget speech of 2014-15 and two have been announced in 2015-16. The seven new IIMS are set up in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, Jammu and Andhra Pradesh. The annual report of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (2016-17) also points out that a scheme to establish twenty new Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), on a non-for-profit Public Private Partnership (N-PPP) basis has been approved by the cabinet in December 2016. The ministry had already approved 19 out of 20 IIITs. The website of the National Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh states that it is the 31st institution among the chain of NITs started by the Government of India. NIT Andhra Pradesh is established in the state of Andhra Pradesh recently in the academic year 2015 \u2013 2016. An answer is Lok Sabha states that Kendriya Vidyalayas are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence personnel on receipt of a proposal from a Ministry/Department of Government of India or State Governments or Union Territory Administration and committing availability of requisite resources for setting up a new KV. As per the annual reports of the KV Sanghatan, 11 new KVs were opened in 2014-15, 25 in 2015-16, 14 in 2016-17. Data for 2017-18 is not yet available. Hence in the 3-year period between 2014-15 and 2016-17, 50 new KVs were opened. The annual reports also mention that many of these KVs were sanctioned during the UPA. The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. 62 new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas have been sanctioned in the districts uncovered so far. Claim: Numerous universities, 7 IITs, 7 IIMs, 14 IIITs, 1 NIT, 103 KVs and 62 Navodaya Vidyalayas established and have started functioning. Fact: There has been an increase in the number of universities in India since Independence. The claim is not specific on the number of new universities setup. As far as the other institutions are concerned, it is true that 7 IITs, 7 IIMs, 19 IIITs, 1 NIT have been established in the last 4 years. Only 50 new KVs were opened in the first 3 years while 62 JNVs have been established in the last four years. Hence, the claim is PARTLY TRUE. What is the IIM bill? The second claim of the government is that major reform in education was ensured by granting autonomy to quality institutes by passing IIM bill. The Indian Institutes of Management Bill 2017 was aimed at \u2018declaring certain Institutes of management to be institutions of national importance with a view to empower these institutions to attain standards of global excellence in management, management research and allied areas of knowledge and to provide for certain other matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\u2019 The Rajya Sabha passed the bill in December 2017 and the act was notified in the gazette in December 2017. This bill declared 20 of the existing IIMs as institutes of national importance and gave them the power to grant degrees as opposed to post graduate diplomas being granted till now. The bill provides a greater level of autonomy for the board of governors and reduces the role of the government. The autonomy granted to IIMs under the bill allows the institutes to have the director appointed by the governing board instead of the central government (as is the case with IITs and AIIMS). Whether this bill leads to reform in education as claimed by the government remains to be seen. Claim: Major reform in education ensured by granting autonomy to quality institutes by passing IIM bill. Fact: The IIM bill was passed by the parliament and was notified in December 2017. The bill grants autonomy to IIMs. The claim is hence TRUE. However, whether this bill leads to reform in education as claimed by the government remains to be seen. Hence this part of the claim is UNVERIFIED. What about the PM Research Fellowship? The last claim is that talent has been recognized with the PM research fellowship that provides scholarship worth Rs. 70,000 to 80,000 per month for 5 years and Rs. 2 lakh annual grant for PhD and research. The cabinet approved the Prime Minister\u2019s Research Fellows (PMRF) scheme with a total outlay of Rs. 1650 crores for a seven-year period starting 2018-19. Under the PMRF scheme, a maximum of 3000 meritorious students from IITs, IISs, IIITs, NITs and IISERs shall be selected in three batches starting from 2018-19 through a rigorous process and provided direct admission into Ph. D programmes in IITs and IISc to pursue research in frontier areas of science and technology. These fellows will be entitled to a monthly scholarship of Rs. 70,000 for the first two years, Rs. 75,000 for the third year and Rs. 80,000 for the final two years. In addition to the monthly scholarship, each fellow will be eligible for a research grant of Rs. 2 lakh per year for 5 years towards foreign travel for presenting research papers. This has been stated in the government order issued in February 2018. It has to be noted that only Rs. 75 crores has been allocated for this purpose in the 2018-19 budget. The government also stated in Lok Sabha that a total of 135 students have been selected in the PMRF Scheme in 2018-19, including 37 from IITs, 84 from NITs, 5 from IIITs, 4 from IISERs, 3 from IIEST Shibpur and 2 from IISc Bangalore. Similar schemes existed during the UPA where doctoral students were provided fellowships through a scheme in the PPP mode and other schemes of the Ministry of Science & Technology. Claim: Talent is being recognized with PM research fellowship with scholarship worth 70-80,000 rupees per month for 5 years and Rs. 2 lakh rupees annual grant for PhD and research. Fact: A new scholarship scheme that pays students doctoral students Rs.70-80,000 rupees per month for 5 years and gives a Rs. 2 lakh grant every year for foreign travel has been announced. 135 students have received this scholarship in its first year. Hence, the claim is TRUE. It also has to be noted that similar schemes existed during the UPA as well. This story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government. This series has been made possible with the flash grant of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN). Read the rest of the stories in this series here",

        "claim": "A phone call, text message, or email says that you have won the Mega Millions lottery jackpot and asks for a fee to claim the prize.",
        "doc": "Advertisment: About this rating In November 2022, we received an email from a reader who reported being targeted by a scam. Scammers said the person had won the Mega Millions lottery jackpot. The scammers provided a \"claim check number\" and told the victim to go to a local Dollar General store. The victim was asked to wire $475, perhaps through Western Union, in order to claim the fake prize. Thankfully, the person did not appear to have sent any money to the scammers. To be clear, Mega Millions published on its own official website that \"there is never a fee to claim a real lottery prize.\" If someone is claiming to be with Mega Millions and asks for money in order to receive winnings, then it's a scam. We found several examples of this scam being documented by consumers on Facebook. One user postedabout being asked by scammers for an \"insurance deposit.\" It finally happened today. The phone rang. Caller ID said it was from a Richard Griswold. Not knowing who that is, I let it go to the answering machine. The voice said I was the grand prize winner in the combined Mega Millions and Publishers Clearing House Fall Sweepstakes of hundreds of millions plus a bonus prize of a new Mercedes. All I had to do was call their manger at a phone number in NYC (Area code 347) - which was surprising that it was not India, Belarus or Nigeria. Here's the kicker. I (of course) would need to make an \"insurance deposit\" with them in order to make sure the funds were being released to the proper winner. Many of the posts we reviewed indicated that scammers were referring to their scam as the \"Mega Millions Sweepstakes.\" Good Afternoon Facebook Family and Friends. Well the scammers are at it again. This time it is about winning the Mega Millions Sweepstakes. The call back number is 218-277-1559. Please forward. Caller provides you with what appears to be legit info. But nothing but a SCAM. Seniors particularly be aware. We strongly advise that readers do not click on suspicious links or call suspicious phone numbers. Scammers are known for creating websites that might look like an official company page. They might also impersonate customer service departments over the phone for whatever company they're claiming to be affiliated with. However, it's all simply part of the scam. Regarding these kinds of sweepstakes scams, the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) advised the following on itswebsite: According to BBB Scam Tracker data, sweepstakes scammers reach out through a variety of channels: phone calls, email, social media, notices in the mail, and text messages. They may impersonate well-known sweepstakes such asPublishers Clearing Houseor a state or provincial lottery. The \"winner\" is told to pay taxes or fees before the prize can be awarded. The FTC notes that people increasingly are asked to buy gift cards to pay these fees -- its use is documented further in BBB's 2021 in-depth investigativestudy on gift card fraud-- but they also may be asked to pay via wire transfer or bank deposit into a specified account, or even cash sent by mail. The prize does not exist, something the people may not realize before paying thousands of dollars that cannot be recouped. However, the harm suffered by lottery fraud victims can far exceed the loss of that money. The losses can put severe strains on family trust, and victims have even committed suicide. In addition, repeat victims may have difficulty ending their involvement in a lottery scam, and they may become money mules who receive and forward money from other lottery fraud victims. Shortly after his wife died in 2020, a Michigan man in his 80s was contacted by scammers who told him he had won second place in a popular sweepstakes, winning $2.5 million, a brand-new luxury car, and gold medallions. He subsequently began talking to the scammers daily on the phone, reaching out to them even after his daughter changed his phone number. He withdrew money from his retirement account and opened a separate account, sending a total of $72,000 in cash to an address in Mississippi before his daughter cut off contact between him and the scammers. The BBB also published tips on how to tell fake sweepstakes and lottery offers from real ones: Additionally, the BBB website provided information for people to report the scammers. We previously reported about a similar scam on the subject of the Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes.

        "doc": "\"This invasion of the US is authorized by @JoeBiden's @WhiteHouse and being supported by @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi and the @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems,\" said former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik in May 7, 2023 Twitter and Instagram posts sharing the image. \"Who is going to financially support these people? The American taxpayer!\" Similar posts warning of an \"invasion\" rocketed across Twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms, amplified by prominent conservatives such as US Senator Mike Lee, former acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. \"These invaders will be entering our country this week,\" tweeted former Republican Senate candidate Lauren Witzke, a far-right activist who has promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. \"We no longer have a nation. Prepare accordingly.\" The posts spread as the United States prepares to lift Title 42, a pandemic-era program former president Donald Trump introduced to swiftly expel people trying to enter the United States. The Pentagon has sent troops to the border in anticipation of a potential surge of migrants after the protocol ends May 11. But the image is not recent or related to the Biden administration's rule change. AFP photojournalist Guillermo Arias took the picture October 27, 2018. It shows migrants leaving Arriaga, Mexico for San Pedro Tapanatepec in a trek toward the United States. AFP and other media reported the caravan began with a group fleeing violence in Honduras and grew to several thousand people seeking to reach the US border, generating headlines and political controversy. Writing for AFP Correspondent in 2019, Arias said he captured the shot using a drone. \"The police had blocked the road for a few hours, so the group had gathered together in one spot,\" Arias said. \"The image really shows the scale and it was the last time that we have been able to make a picture like that. I think that was the moment that US President Donald Trump began to talk about 'an invasion.' When I made the photo, these people had already crossed three borders.\" Other AFP photos from the time show the same scene. Some social media users who misrepresented the picture -- including Lee, the US lawmaker from the state of Utah -- later clarified it was out of date. \"Update: apparently this is an old photo. My bad,\" Lee said in an edited version of his tweet. AFP has debunked other misinformation about the end of Title 42 here.",

        "doc": "On 12 March 2016, the unreliable web site American News published article claiming that recently passed resolution required residents of a Texas county to pay slavery reparations to African-Americans: Last week, a group of Dallas County commissioners decided to pass a Juneteenth resolution, in commemoration of the day that slaves in Texas earned their freedom. What many didn\u2019t realize, however, was that the resolution was also a declaration that African Americans should receive reparations for slavery. According to the Daily Morning News, Commissioner John Wiley Price authored the resolution, which \u201cincluded a long list of injustices endured by blacks, from slavery to Jim Crow to predatory lending practices.\u201d Then, in its final paragraph, it declared that the suffering of African-Americans should be \u2018satisfied with monetary and substantial reparations.\u2019 The article was also picked up a few days later by verbatim by the web site Defund.com, which claimed that the measure in question has passed \u201clast week.\u201d The only truth to either article was that, as noted in an item published by The Dallas Morning News back in June 2014, Dallas County has passed a non-binding \u201cJuneteenth Resolution\u201d (largely voted for by country commissioners who hadn\u2019t bothered reading it first) that did not result in any tax money changing hands or the mandatory payment of reparations: The issue arose in a resolution written by John Wiley Price, the county\u2019s only black commissioner. Described only as a \u201cJuneteenth Resolution,\u201d it was approved unanimously. Other commissioners admitted after their meeting that they hadn\u2019t read the document before voting for it. Commissioner Mike Cantrell, the court\u2019s lone Republican, later changed his vote to an abstention. \u201cThe reason why I didn\u2019t abstain this morning is that I had not received a copy of the resolution,\u201d he said. None of the other commissioners changed their votes, meaning the resolution remains the county\u2019s official position.It is, however, a nonbinding resolution, and no tax money will change hands as a result of its passage. While American News isn\u2019t a standard fake news site, it primarily trafficks in recycling misleading, satire-based, or years-old information under clickbait headlines. Among the many less-than-credible items published by that site are claims about after-birth abortions, America opening its \u201cfirst\u201d FEMA camp, Sadie Robertson\u2018s being gravely injured in a car wreck, Beyonce\u2019s being was banned from Canada over her Super Bowl 2016 performance, President Obama\u2019s personally banning an admiral from distributing Bibles, and new evidence casting doubt on the veracity of President Obama\u2019s birth certificate. In June 2015, American News attracted traffic by falsely claiming that the President had announced he was forcing all Americans to pay reparations.",

That\u2019s the grim and unimaginative premise of a fake, January 2018 post on the \u201csatirical\u201d Huzlers web site, which falsely reported that technology companies had been leaking their plans to produce and sell just such a machine by 2019. According to reports, tech companies that are producing realistic sex robots are trying to reach the next level in creating sex robots that can cook and clean. Company spokesperson\u2019s say the cooking and cleaning sex robots can be available for purchase as soon as next year. Despite citing \u201creports,\u201d the article does not include any specific sources, and we could find no corroboration for a specific plan to market an automaton that cooks and cleans as well as providing sexual gratification, by 2019. The article goes on to quote \u201cJan Kunchai,\u201d an engineer at RealBotix. RealBotix is an actual company, known for creating the sex robot \u201cHarmony,\u201d but we couldn\u2019t find any evidence of a \u201cJan Kunchai\u201d working there. Inventors and designers have been working on developing sex robots for years, and companies like RealBotix have produced prototypes that could actualize what had previously been only theoretical plans or non-functioning prototypes. At the same time, British company Moley Robotics has come up with a prototype for a robotic kitchen, which consists of two robotic arms that can carry out a recipe stored in its memory based on 3-D videos of the movements made by a human. According to the company, the kitchen is scheduled to go on sale to the public in 2018. Robot vacuum cleaners (like the Roomba) and mopping robots are already available on the market, although they are limited to fairly basic functions and can\u2019t navigate any surface other than a floor. A fully-functioning, human-like robot that can cook, clean and provide sexual gratification is a theoretical possibility, but the technological sophistication required to produce one is not even close to being in place, and certainly won\u2019t be by 2019. That\u2019s not to mention the many ethical dilemmas presented by the prospect of such an invention. The article is no more than a hoax based on a bad joke. In case there were any doubt, Huzlers describes itself as \u201cthe most infamous fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world.\u201d Based on its 10,600 Facebook followers, not even that is true.",

Identical images, alongside a similar claim, were also shared tens of thousands of times on Twitter here, here and here, and Facebook here and here, including these posts here and here in Africa. The claim, however, is misleading. A reverse image search on Yandex of the image in the misleading tweet found the same image in this video published on YouTube channel of Indonesian news outlet TribunnewsWIKI, on January 23, 2020. The video\u2019s Indonesian headline translates to English as: \u201cBell's Palsy - A condition where facial muscles are weakened or paralyzed\u201d. The description reads, in part: \u201cMost people think Bell's Palsy is a stroke because of the similarity in the symptoms, namely paralysis. However, it\u2019s not the reality, the two diseases are different. Bell's palsy is limited to the facial muscles and most sufferers recover completely within six months... This disease occurs when the nerves that control the facial muscles are inflamed, swollen, or compressed. Bell's palsy is caused by trauma to the seventh cranial nerve.\u201d The image in the misleading tweet matches the YouTube video from its three-second mark to its 51-second mark. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading tweet (L) and TribunnewsWIKI\u2019s YouTube video at its three (C) and 51-second mark (R) : The image was also shared here in an article about Bell's palsy on BMJ Best Practice, a UK based healthcare site. The article was last updated on November 20, 2019, according to the dateline. Pfizer and BioNTech SE announced the start of their clinical trials in Germany on April 29, 2020. The statement reads, in part: \u201cBioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, \u201cBioNTech\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) have announced that the first cohort of BioNTech\u2019s Phase 1/2 clinical trial has been dosed. Twelve study participants were dosed with vaccine candidate BNT162 in Germany since dosing began on April 23, 2020. The trial is the first clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate in Germany. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to initiate trials for BNT162 in the United States upon regulatory approval, which is expected shortly.\u201d According to this December 10, 2020 FDA report, there were \u201cfour cases of Bell\u2019s palsy in the vaccine group compared with no cases in the placebo group\u201d, but not as a direct result of receiving the vaccine. The report states, in part: \"Among non-serious unsolicited adverse events, there was a numerical imbalance of four cases of Bell\u2019s palsy in the vaccine group compared with no cases in the placebo group, though the four cases in the vaccine group do not represent a frequency above that expected in the general population.\" It goes on to state: \u201cThe observed frequency of reported Bell\u2019s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time, but FDA will recommend surveillance for cases of Bell\u2019s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.\"",

        "claim": "Says $500 billion in Medicare cuts are coming.",
        "doc": "Defending her own health care measure, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst answered a colleague\u2019s query about preserving insurance for the elderly of Texas by warning that national cuts loom.The Brenham Republican, who chairs the House Public Health Committee, said during June 15 floor debate: \"We know they are reducing the entitlement to Medicare.\" She added: \"We know that we have these cuts coming our way of over half a trillion to Medicare.\"We do?Some background: PolitiFact teams in Washington and other states have pointed out that it\u2019s incorrect to deem reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, written into the federal health care overhaul signed into law last year by President Barack Obama, as cuts. These reductions are being counted as projected savings compared to what would have happened without the change in law. The program\u2019s overall costs are projected to increase to $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in 2009, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Also, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, tagged Obamacare by critics, doesn\u2019t eliminate benefits. Indeed, portions of the law improve benefits and coverage, according to Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health care research organization. Medicare will cover more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and recipients won't face the \"doughnut hole\" gap in prescription coverage imposed under an existing Medicare program. Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund other coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, Neuman has said.To back up Kolkhorst's claim, which was brought to our attention by Democratic activist Phillip Martin, her office passed along a September 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece quoting Richard S. Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, outlining intended cuts in payments to medical providers and hospitals as well as reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients.It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare.The 2010 health care law will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The law also calls for slowing increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. Also, the law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, though the board \u2014 the Independent Payment Advisory Board \u2014 is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.Kolkhorst\u2019s office pointed us to the Medicare actuary\u2019s April 2010 analysis, which includes a chart suggesting that through 2019, the new law will net Medicare \"savings\" of $575.1 billion. It also says that 60.5 million Americans will be covered by Medicare in 2019, the same number that would have been covered without a change in law.Foster\u2019s memo says the Medicare savings are to be achieved largely through reduced payments to medical providers including hospitals, tied to raised productivity expectations. It warns, though, that those gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis and would also probably prove unworkable and less than projected in some health-care sectors during the law\u2019s roll-out.Moreover, his memo says, health care providers \"for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries).\" It says its own simulations suggest that about 15 percent of providers in the Medicare program specific to inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as hospice care and home health services would become unprofitable by 2019 due to the productivity provisions.Kolkhorst\u2019s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, suggested the projected reductions in rates are tantamount to cuts in Medicare. He said by email: \"If there is an entitlement for everyone eligible to receive a pizza, and we are cutting the rate paid to pizza kitchens by x percent, then there will be less of that entitlement for pizza.\"Similarly, Kolkhorst told us the changes built into the 2010 law will reduce access to Medicare. \"You\u2019re splitting hairs to say those are savings; they\u2019re cuts,\" she said, adding: \"Things are going to change ... To say that everything is going to remain as it is today, that\u2019s erroneous.\"That last point seems reasonable, but it\u2019s not exactly what she told her House colleagues.The referenced $500 billion figure depends on a slowing in the pace of Medicare cost increases. That\u2019s not the same as cutting back. Medicare spending will still grow; benefits will expand.Still, there remains the prospect of some providers quitting Medicare, possibly making it harder for patients to get care. Kolkhorst\u2019s statement has an element of truth, making it Barely True.",

In the image, Boebert is standing with members of the \"Bikers for Trump\" group, as well as \"American Patriots II%,\" which is listed as an anti-government extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Some people in the photograph appear to be displaying a white supremacist symbol.

And while members of Congress have, indeed, gotten raises over the years, it hasn\u2019t happened since 2009. As well, the salary increases that have been approved in the last 30 years appear to add up to less than half of the 231% figure the post employs. Required by Article I, Section 6, the Framers of the Constitution decided that Congress would determine its own salary. In 1789, members earned $6 a day when they attended sessions. The per diem was increased to $7 for senators that same year, marking the first official congressional pay raise. After that, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay \u2013 until 30 years ago with the passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. The bill established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is fixed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) that measures changes in wages \u2013 meaning that the raises must be equal to increases in the ECI. Under this system, congressional pay increases are automatic each year unless Congress votes it down \u2013 which it has done since 2009 \u2013 the last year senators and representatives received a salary adjustment. According to a Congressional Research Service report, rank-and-file members of Congress were making $89,500 30 years ago in 1989. Today, they receive the same salary they have since 2009: $174,000. That comes to a 30-year increase of 94 percent. (Note that Congressional leadership receives higher salaries: $223,500 annually for the Speaker of the House today, and $193,400 for the Senate President pro tempore. The majority and minority leaders in both chambers also receive $193,400.) Bill Ryan, spokesperson for the Library of Congress, confirmed to PolitiFact that, per the Congressional Research Service report we consulted, the salaries have seen a 94% increase since 1989. The post is even more incorrect when you consider inflation. The $89,500 lawmakers were earning in 1989 today would be worth nearly $182,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics's inflation calculator. When it comes to the upcoming adjustment in January 2020, if the potential increase of $4,500 is approved, the projected percentage increase for the year would be 2.6%, bringing the total 30-year increase to 84 percent over the $96,000 salary members received in 1990. A post on social media says that over the last 30 years, congressional salaries have gone up \"231% while 80% of Americans haven\u2019t even been able to keep up with Cost of Living!\" While three-quarters of full-time U.S. workers did say they live paycheck-to-paycheck, congressional salaries haven\u2019t increased since 2009, and in the last 30 years have gone up about 94%.

        "doc": "U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, made a pitch for free-trade agreements early on election night, a few hours before Republican Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race put those pacts in jeopardy. Beyer was interviewed by PJ Media, a conservative online news outlet and blog. If Democrat Hillary Clinton won the presidency, he was asked, what would Democrats do to gain the support of those who voted for Trump \"specifically on the trade issue?\" \"First, I don\u2019t think we can abandon our trade agenda,\" Beyer said. \"We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20.\" Beyer offered a far rosier view of free-trade agreements than Trump, whose unrelenting criticism of them is credited with helping him to attract critical blue-collar votes. Trump says the agreements have encouraged U.S. manufacturers to move plants and jobs to countries that offer cheaper labor. He\u2019s vowed to renegotiate - and possibly pull out of - the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And he promised not to enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim nations. So we wondered whether Beyer has it right when he says the U.S. has a surplus with all of its partners in existing trade deals. Uncle Sam, indeed, has trade agreements with 20 nations, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico and Canada, as we mentioned, are part of NAFTA, which became effective in 1994. Six nations joined the U.S. in 2004 in the Central American Free Trade Agreement: Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. has independent trade agreements with 12 nations: Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru and Singapore. Census Bureau records show that during the first nine months of 2016, the U.S. was running overall trade deficits with seven of its agreement partners. Here are those nations and the U.S. negative trade balance with them: \u2022Canada, $5.8 billion; \u2022Colombia, $642 million; \u2022Israel, $7 billion; \u2022Jordan, $197 million; \u2022South Korea, $22.8 billion; \u2022Mexico, $46.8 billion; and \u2022Nicaragua, $1.4 billion. When you add up the balances of all 20 nations with pacts, the U.S. was running a $54.5 billion trade deficit for the first nine months of this year. We examined the numbers for 2015 and found a similar result. The U.S. had trade deficits with six of the countries; only Colombia fell off the list. The U.S. had a composite $64 billion trade deficit with its 20 trade-agreement nations. All told, the U.S. ran up a $546 billion global trade deficit during the first nine months of this year and a $746 billion deficit in 2015. About half of the U.S. deficit both years came from its trade with China. We finally should note that we made two efforts to contact Beyer\u2019s office for this article and did not get a reply. Our ruling Beyer said, \"We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20.\" Data show the U.S. is running trade deficits with seven of those trade-agreement nations through the first nine months of this year and ran deficits with six of those countries in 2015.

        "claim": "\"In this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote.\"",
        "doc": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and is considering running for president, recently decried the lack of Americans participating in the electoral process during a town hall at a union hall in Austin, Texas. During an appearance at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers-sponsored town hall on March 31, 2015, Sanders told the audience: \"I beg of you do not enter that world of despair. We can win this fight. In order to win this struggle we are going to need nothing less than a political revolution, and let me tell you what I mean by \u2018a political revolution.\u2019 When, as was the case in this last election in November, when 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, when 80 percent of young people, when 75 percent of low-income workers, chose not to vote, what we need to do is create a momentum so that 70, 80, 90 percent of the people vote. And when that happens, we win hands down.\" It's a longstanding concern for Sanders, who has introduced a bill to make Election Day a national holiday so more people can vote. We wondered: Was Sanders right about the low level of voter participation? First, let\u2019s look at the numbers. \u2022 \"63 percent of the American people chose not to vote.\" Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist, has assembled the United States Election Project, an extensive and widely used archive of voter participation data. He found that in the November 2014 general election, 33.2 percent of the voting-age population cast a ballot and 35.9 percent of the voting-eligible population voted. The difference between those two figures is that the voting-age population includes non-citizens and felons, neither of which are able to vote, whereas the voting-eligible population excludes these groups. If you flip the numbers so they are expressed as Sanders used them, 66.8 percent of the voting-age population didn\u2019t vote, and 64.1 percent of the voting-eligible population didn\u2019t vote. Using the latter figure -- which political scientists consider a better measurement -- Sanders is quite close. Incidentally, according to McDonald\u2019s data, the overall turnout rate in 2014 was the lowest since World War II. \u2022 \"80 percent of young people\" did not vote. We found a study conducted by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University that had some relevant data for voters age 18-29. It estimated a turnout rate for that age group of 21.5 percent. That works out to a 78.5 percent non-participation rate -- close to the 80 percent Sanders cited. \u2022 \"75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote.\" This is the claim for which Sanders has the weakest support. After each election cycle is over, the Census Bureau looks back at how many Americans of different demographic groups voted. The data isn\u2019t yet compiled for the 2014 election, so we looked instead at the 2010 election -- the most recent midterm election prior to 2014. (In general, presidential-year elections see higher turnout across the board than midterms do, so using 2010 offers the best apples-to-apples comparison for 2014.) According to the 2010 data, those earning less than $30,000 a year -- the cutoff Sanders\u2019 office told us he was using -- had a turnout rate of either 28.9 percent (if you use total population) or 34.6 percent (if you use citizens only). Flip those and you get 65 percent of citizens in that income category not voting, or 71 percent of everyone in that income category not voting. Those are both lower than Sanders\u2019 claim of 75 percent, and for the more salient statistic -- citizens alone -- it\u2019s off by a full 10 percentage points. (Jeff Frank, a Sanders spokesman, acknowledged that the statement was an estimate.) We should note that political scientists say that the census data may overstate actual voting rates, since it\u2019s based on what respondents tell researchers, and there\u2019s a widespread assumption that people over-report socially admired actions like voting. So it\u2019s possible that Sanders\u2019 75 percent figure is closer to accurate. However, saying so requires speculating beyond the hard figures. To sum up, then: On the numbers, Sanders is quite close for turnout rates among Americans overall and among young people, but he\u2019s a bit off for turnout rates for lower-income Americans. Did all of these people 'choose not to vote'? However, there\u2019s another wrinkle to what Sanders said. Sanders twice used the phrasing \"chose not to vote.\" In the same Census Bureau survey we mentioned earlier, researchers asked for the reason why people didn\u2019t vote. It\u2019s broken down by age and income, so we can check all three of Sanders\u2019 claims against the data for 2010. We divided the stated reasons for not voting into two categories -- reasons of circumstance and reasons of choice. Under reasons of circumstance, we included \"illness or disability,\" \"out of town,\" \"too busy/conflicting schedule,\" \"transportation problems,\" \"registration problems,\" \"bad weather conditions,\" and \"inconvenient polling places.\" Under reasons of choice, we included \"forgot to vote,\" \"not interested,\" and \"did not like candidates or campaign issues.\" (We ignored \"other\" and \"didn\u2019t know.\") Our division is not infallible -- others can combine the reasons into their own categories -- but we think our calculation offers a useful starting point for comparison. All three demographic groups Sanders mentioned turn out to have pretty similar breakdowns. For Americans overall, 55 percent didn\u2019t vote for reasons of circumstance. For young Americans, it was 56 percent, and for low-income Americans, it was 52 percent. By contrast, the percentages of people not voting by choice were lower across the board. For Americans overall, it was 33 percent. For young Americans, it was 30 percent and for lower-income Americans it was 34 percent. This means that Sanders went too far when he said that large majorities chose not to vote. \"It would be true to say that roughly an estimated 80 percent of youth did not vote in the 2014 midterm,\" said Abby Kiesa, youth coordinator and researcher at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. \"However, the existing research about youth voting does not suggest that all of those youth actively chose not to vote. In fact, young people in particular face barriers such as navigating a new system, that may prevent them from registering and voting, even if they do want to vote.\" This may have been an unintentional word choice on Sanders\u2019 part, but at PolitiFact we pay close attention to speakers\u2019 precise wording. Class differences in voting A final note: Sanders may have gotten some of his numbers wrong, but he does have a point that poorer Americans vote at lower rates than rich Americans do, as do younger Americans. \"There is a class bias in voting,\" said Sean McElwee, a research associate with the think tank Demos. In 2010, for instance, the Census Bureau found that as 34.6 percent of citizens making below $30,000 were voting, a much higher percentage of those earning at least $150,000 voted -- 59 percent. Even taking into account the caveats in the data, McElwee said, \"this is a disturbing gap.\" Our ruling Sanders said that \"in this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote.\" Sanders was too loose with some of his numbers and his wording, but he has a point that rates of non-voting among Americans, and especially among younger and poorer Americans, are high.

        "claim": "The BBC has confirmed that monkeypox is an airborne form of herpes that is capable of infecting anyone within 15 feet.",
        "doc": "A graphic claiming to be from the BBC makes numerous false claims about the virus. The broadcaster has confirmed that the image is fabricated. Context: A graphic doing the rounds on numerous Facebook and Tiktok accounts includes a series of claims relating to monkeypox. The graphic has been designed to emulate the BBC\u2019s formatting and includes the organization\u2019s branding. It claims that the disease has been classified as a variant of herpes and that airborne infection can occur over a distance of 15 feet. It further states that the disease routinely persists for two to four months and that infection carries the risk of paralysis. In Fact: The graphic that purports to have been produced by the BBC contains several claims about monkeypox that are factually inaccurate. The infectious agent responsible for the disease is from a family of viruses known as \"Poxviridae,\" which contains viruses such as smallpox but not that which is responsible for herpes. The two viruses are not closely related, and neither is a form or variant of the other. The claim that monkeypox is airborne and transmissible over 15 feet is also misleading. Diseases are typically classified as airborne if the infectious material remains in the air for a prolonged period and is capable of infecting others at a significant distance. While monkeypox may be transmitted via respiratory secretions, there is no evidence that the virus may infect others via this means outside of close contact, nor that it persists in the air for a significant length of time. While the effects of monkeypox can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, there is no evidence to suggest that infected individuals are particularly susceptible to paralysis. There are no publicly recorded cases of monkeypox causing paralysis since the beginning of this outbreak and neither the NHS nor CDC lists it as a common symptom of the disease. Responding to the circulation of this graphic, a spokesperson for the BBC told USA Today: \u201cWe can confirm that this is not a real BBC graphic and we urge people to check the veracity of stories on the BBC News website.\u201d Verdict: The image that has been circulating on social media contains verifiably false information concerning monkeypox. The BBC has confirmed that it is not a graphic produced by their organization. ",

        "claim": "A recent invasion of New Guinea Flatworms in Florida poses a significant risk to human health and a sighting of this non-native animal should be reported to authorities by calling 911.",
        "doc": "On 21 March 2017, a viral post from aweb site called Goodfullness.com (titled \u201cIf You See One of These Slugs Inside Your House, Dial 911 Immediately!\u201d), argued that the invasion of the New Guinea Flatworm in Florida posesa acute risk to human health that necessitates calling 911. While this post (and many others like it) frames their invasion as a new event, it is not. This non-native species, also called Platydemus manokwari, was first spotted in August 2012 and confirmed by a team of researchers in 2015 in a scientific report that made significant news at the time: In the USA, the accidental introduction of P. manokwari through human agency to Florida is probably recent, with our first specimens found in August 2012. The species is apparently now well established, with several different locations found in 2014 in Miami Dade County. While viral posts implied that the discovery of a New Guinea Flatworm in one\u2019s home necessitates a police response, authorities suggest otherwise. We reached out to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to ask if their department recommended reporting sightings of the New Guinea Flatworm to 911. They told us, via e-mail, that it is not necessary: The FWC is aware that New Guinea flatworms have spread to many parts of Florida, and people do not need to report sightings. Indeed, the primary danger of the New Guinea Flatworm is to theecosystem rather than tohuman health. The pest has an infamous track record of damaging the ecosystems to which they have been introduced, as discussed in a 2014 study on their occurrence in France: Examined from an environmental perspective, P. manokwari has demonstrably had a serious negative impact on the biodiversity of native snail populations in the Pacific region [\u2026] and wherever it is deliberately or accidentally introduced it will continue to pose a threat not only to native molluscs, but possibly to other slow-moving soil invertebrates [\u2026] It may also indirectly have a negative impact on vertebrate species dependent upon these soil invertebrates. From a human health standpoint, the Goodfullness.com post makes a number of assertions about the risks P. manokwari presents to humans and other, larger creatures: These worms have the ability to consume rats and mice and when they dine on these animals, they pass on lungworm infections. From there, the infections are then transmitted to humans who are exposed to any air particles that have been contaminated by the rodent droppings. According to Florida International University professor of biology Timothy Collins, who actively studies their occurrence in Florida, the New Guinea Flatworm does not prey on rats, and typically eats \u201csnails, earthworms, [and] slow-moving arthropods\u201d. The New Guinea Flatworm is, however, a possible carrier of a parasite that passes through the feces of rats \u2014 the rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). This parasite generally causes mild symptoms that generally resolve without treatment, but is capable of a more serious infection called eosinophilic meningitis, according tothe CDC: Some infected people don\u2019t have any symptoms \u2014 or have only mild symptoms that don\u2019t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. The rat lungworm, as it turns out, utilizes a complex life cycle which requires three hosts, one of which can be a flatworm or snail, as described in a 2012 review of the parasite: When rats eat infected slugs or snails, they ingest third stage larvae which eventually grow to sexual maturity and reproduce in the heart. Single-celled eggs hatch in the lung, and first stage larvae migrate up the bronchial tree, are swallowed, and 6\u20138 weeks after infection are excreted with feces. Slugs or snails then eat rat feces and acquire the first stage larvae. Slugs and snails are obligatory intermediate hosts which support parasite development from the first to the third larval stage. If one\u2019s food were to accidentally come in contact with the mucus of an infected flatworm, or if one were to directly consume the animal itself, you could potentially contract a rat lungworm infection, Collins told us via email: Angiostrongylus cantonensis, or rat lungworm, is carried by many animals, including Platydemus. For example, it has been reported in the Giant African Land Snail in Florida. There are published medical cases of people becoming infected with Angiostrongylus after eating lettuce over which snails infected with Angiostrongylyus have crawled. He tempered this analysis, however, with the caveat that there have yet to be any confirmed cases of the New Guinea Flatworm carrying the rat ringworm in Florida, and provided us with this simple advice: The average person can avoid risk by not handling the flatworms, or if they do, by not putting their hands near their eyes or nose before cleaning them carefully. In addition to the health risk, Platydemus have been reported by some brave soul to taste terrible, so eating them is a bad idea all around. This advice is in line with the CDC\u2019s position as well: Don\u2019t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables. This invasive creatureis a big problem for local ecosystems, and it is an issue that Collins and other scientists are actively researching. However, whilethere are indirect potential risks to humans from the New Guinea Flatworm in Florida, these risks in no way necessitate calling 911.",

        "claim": "\"To curb water wastage, the Department of Water and Sanitation has begun its programme of training 15,000 young people as artisans.\"",
        "doc": "We re-examined eight claims from four state of the nation addresses. Sona 2016 and 2017 were by president Jacob Zuma, and Sona 2018 and 2019 by president Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma's claims about training for water conservation, and the number of men and women in senior management positions, were correct. Claims on load shedding and housing delivery were incorrect. Ramaphosa's claims about higher education enrolment and social grants were correct. A claim about early childhood education was incorrect, and another on safe toilets in schools unproven. On 13 February 2020, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his fourth state of the nation address. The theme for this year's speech is \"Following up on our commitments: making your future work better.\" The president is expected to update South Africans on the government's progress and outline plans for the next financial year. Africa Check has been fact-checking state of the nation addresses for over six years. If Ramaphosa's track record is anything to go by, we can expect mainly accurate statements on Thursday evening. (He didn't get much factually incorrect in his 2019 address .) Ramaphosa's predecessor, Jacob Zuma, had a harder time staying on the right side of the facts. When he was president of South Africa from 2009 to 2018, he was no stranger to our \"incorrect\" verdict . In this report we review key claims made in the last four state of the nation addresses and give updates on each, according to the most recent statistics. 'Let us work together to turn the situation around. It can be done.' \u2013 Jacob Zuma, Sona 2016 In February 2016 Zuma delivered his ninth state of the nation address . Africa Check looked at seven claims made on the night. One was correct, four mostly correct, and two were incorrect. Claim \"To curb water wastage, the Department of Water and Sanitation has begun its programme of training 15,000 young people as artisans.\" Verdict correct The department of water and sanitation launched their War on Leaks project in August 2015. Its initial aim was to train 15,000 artisans, water agents and plumbers from 2015/16 to 2017/18. They would fix leaking taps and pipes in their communities, helping promote water conservation. Water agents were tasked with educating the public on how to use water wisely and manage water resources. Zuma was correct when he made this statement in 2016. As of 25 January 2016, 2,897 people were being trained, former department spokesperson Mlimandlela Ndamase told Africa Check. They included 1,573 artisans, 243 plumbers and 1,081 water agents. But how have things progressed since then? Phase 1 of the project was meant to be completed in the 2015/16 financial year, after 3,000 artisans, plumbers and water agents were trained. Figures from November 2019 show that 1,726 candidates completed their training. Another 5,000 were meant to be trained in 2016/17, when phase 2 started. But the available data shows that only 3,854 people were trained. Phase 3 was \"put on hold\" due to the department's \"funding challenges\". A commitment to more funding was reportedly made in January 2020. \"As you correctly say, the programme was implemented,\" Prof Mike Muller, former director general of water affairs, told Africa Check. \"However, I am not aware of any claims that it has been successful \u2013 in fact quite the opposite. It has been recognised by government that the programme has failed to meet its goals.\" Claim \"There has been no load shedding since August last year.\" Verdict incorrect Zuma was incorrect when he made this statement in February 2016. According to a media statement by power utility Eskom, there was load shedding on 14 September 2015. South Africa is again experiencing these rotational power outages as Eskom's shortage of capacity continues. The utility says there's a possibility load shedding will remain for the next 18 months. 'Let us unite in driving radical economic transformation for the good of our country.' \u2013 Jacob Zuma, Sona 2017 In 2017, amid unprecedented security measures , Zuma delivered his 10th state of the nation address. It was his last as president of South Africa. Africa Check looked at 20 claims in the speech. Only 12 were correct, with the rest a mixture of mostly correct, misleading, unproven, understated and incorrect. Claim \"At the level of gender, at senior management level males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4%.\" Verdict correct The commission for employment equity's 2015/16 annual report showed that 67.6% of employees at senior management were men and 32.4% were women. Three years later, the situation remains much the same. The commission's 2018/19 annual report showed that 65.5% of employees at senior management were men and 34.5% were women. Claim \"Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than 4 million houses since 1994.\" Verdict incorrect Data from the department of human settlements shows Zuma was incorrect when he made this statement. A total of 3,030,824 housing units were delivered from 1994/1995 to 2015/16 \u2013 around a million less than Zuma claimed. It is possible that Zuma was referring to the delivery of both houses and serviced sites. But a serviced site is not a house. It is a piece of land supplied with water, electricity and sanitation, on which a recipient can build their own house. When serviced sites were added to Zuma's figure, the number of \"housing opportunities\" rose to 4,060,795 How many more houses has the government provided since then? A total of 90,692 houses were built in the 2016/17 financial year, 86,048 in 2017/18 and 77,584 in 2018/19. This brings the total number of houses provided by the government to 3,285,148. The total number of housing opportunities stands at 4.7 million . But there are concerns about the accuracy of housing statistics. Experts caution that the figures have not been independently verified, so they should be seen as \" indicative rather than entirely conclusive \". 'Now is the time for all of us to work together.' \u2013 Cyril Ramaphosa, Sona 2018 South Africa's 2018 state of the nation address was postponed for more than a week as the presidency changed hands from Jacob Zuma to Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa's maiden address touched on education, employment and poverty, among other issues. Of the 12 claims Africa Check looked at, 10 were correct and two incorrect. Claim \"There are currently almost one million students who are enrolled in higher education, up from 500,000 in 1994.\" Verdict correct In 1994, there were 525,000 students enrolled in South Africa's higher education institutions. These included historically black universities and technikons, historically white universities and technikons, and distance-learning institutions. Audited data shows that by 2015, enrolment had grown to 985,212 students at 26 public higher education institutions. Ramaphosa's claim was therefore correct. Since then the figure has grown to more than a million. In 2017, 1,036,984 students were enrolled in 26 public higher education institutions. Claim \"Today we have nearly 1 million children who are participating in early childhood development facilities.\" Verdict incorrect Africa Check previously rated this claim as \"correct\" based on information from the department of basic education . But research suggests that Ramaphosa's figure of \"nearly 1 million children\" is a significant underestimate. Martin Gustafsson , an economics researcher at the University of Stellenbosch , said there were \" widespread misperceptions around how many children in South Africa attend some form of ECD institution\". He has researched and written extensively on the economics of education and pre-school participation . Gustafsson used data from Statistics South Africa's 2016 mid-year population estimates and 2016 Community Survey to estimate the number of children in any type of pre-school in 2016. His calculations put the figure at 2,409,953 children. But he did add that this could be an over or underestimation. Gustafsson was not aware of any updated figures. But if early childhood development participation is higher than what is believed, what are the implications? \"We have to worry less about expanding access and more about improving the quality of what already exists,\" Gustafsson said. 'The task before us is formidable.' \u2013 Cyril Ramaphosa, Sona 2019 Ramaphosa delivered his second state of the nation address in parliament on 7 February 2019. It was also the fifth and final address of the previous administration before the national election in May 2019. Of the 12 claims Africa Check fact-checked, eight were correct and the rest a mixture of mostly correct, unproven and understated. Claim \"Every month 17.5 million social grants are provided to South Africans.\" Verdict correct The South African Social Security Agency administers social grants. Its most recent data on grants at the time was from December 2018, when 17,731,402 social grants were paid. The average for the 2017/18 financial year ending in March 2018 was 17,509,555 grants. Ramaphosa's claim was therefore correct. The most recent data from the 2018/19 financial year shows that the number of social grants provided by the government increased to 17,811,745 . Claim \"Since we launched the [Safe] initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects and a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages.\" Verdict unproven The Sanitation Appropriate for Education \u2013 Safe \u2013 initiative, launched in August 2018, is a government programme that aims to replace all pit latrines and other unacceptable toilet facilities at public schools. At the time the department of basic education told Africa Check that the president's figures were from December 2018. Spokesperson Troy Martens said upgrades had been completed at another 88 schools, bringing the total to 787 in 2019. But it was difficult to independently verify the department's numbers. The claim was rated as unproven. In October 2019, the department gave an update on the progress so far. Records from a committee meeting note that when the Safe initiative was launched and a desktop audit conducted, 3,898 schools were identified as needing attention. For the 2019/20 financial year, there are 1,007 projects: 880 in the planning stage and 127 under construction. The number of completed projects stands at 188. This would bring the total number of completed projects to 975. However, as with the initial claim, it is difficult to verify the figure. A new approach to fact-checking Sona Africa Check is taking a different approach to the state of the nation address this year. Rather than fact-checking all the claims made on the night, we'll conduct a deeper analysis of any claims president Ramaphosa gets wrong. We're not trying to catch him out - we're interested in why the facts were misunderstood and the implications of getting them wrong. Stay tuned! Additional research by Taryn Willows",

        "claim": "In 2011 under Scott Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent \"more on our prison system than we did\" on the University of Wisconsin System.",
        "doc": "The dais was crowded at a candidates\u2019 forum attended by 12 of the Wisconsin Democrats who are running for governor in 2018. One of them joked that \"there's actually another blank name tag up here, so if anybody else wants to get in the race ...\" But much of the event, in Eau Claire on Dec. 11, 2017, was serious, of course. Candidate Kelda Helen Roys used part of her time to attack Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is running for a third term. Roys, a former state Assembly member from Madison, accused Walker of putting prisons ahead of the University of Wisconsin System, saying: I think in 2011, it was Walker\u2019s first budget, and we had the dubious distinction of spending -- for the first time in our state\u2019s history -- more on our prison system that we did on the entire UW System. It\u2019s a claim likely to be repeated during the campaign, so let\u2019s check it out. Journal Sentinel report Walker was elected in 2010; his first state budget was for 2011-\u201913. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2012, that two-year budget allotted, for the first time, more money for prisons and correctional facilities -- that is, for the Department of Corrections -- than for the UW System. The tallies, after a $250 million cut to the UW System: $2.25 billion: Corrections $2.1 billion: UW System The operations of the Department of Corrections includerunning 36 adult prisons and correctional facilities, supervising adult offenders who are probation or parole, and managing the state\u2019s two juvenile correctional facilities and community services for juvenile offenders. The UW System has 13 four-year campuses, including the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison, 13 two-year campuses (known as the UW Colleges) and a statewide extension with offices in each county. The Journal Sentinel\u2019s report, which reviewed more than 20 years of Wisconsin state budgets, pointed out that the eclipse in funding between the two agencies was the culmination of years of policy changes made under both Republican and Democratic governors prior to Walker. Also, nationwide, public universities were seeing cuts while prison spending, sparked by sentencing changes put in motion in the 1980s, was going up. So, the change did occur on Walker\u2019s watch, though it was the culmination of a shift over a period of years. More numbers For a little more context, we reviewed all four of the state budgets that have been adopted under Walker and the four adopted previously, all of which were under Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat. The figures are from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (We\u2019ve indicated in bold whether the UW System or Corrections got more in each budget.) State budget UW System Corrections 2003-\u201905 $1.91 billion $1.7 billion 2005-\u201907 $1.93 billion $1.8 billion 2007-\u201909 $2.24 billion $2.17 billion 2009-\u201911 $2.27 billion $2.25 billion 2011-\u201913 (First Walker budget) $2.1 billion $2.25 billion 2013-\u201915 $2.25 billion $2.32 billion 2015-\u201917 $2.08 billion $2.35 billion* 2017-\u201919 $2.14 billion $2.43 billion* The figures show that in the four budgets before Walker, the gap in funding between the UW System and Corrections got smaller in each biennium; and since Walker, Corrections has gotten more money than the UW System. To be clear, those figures are for state tax dollars only. Corrections is essentially funded entirely with state tax dollars; in contrast, the UW System gets total funding of about $12 billion per year, much of it from federal grants and tuition payments. One thing that has squeezed the UW System is that, although the increases in its state funding slowed under Doyle, tuition was increased. In contrast, state funding for the UW System has remained roughly the same under Walker, but he has frozen tuition. A spokesman in the governor\u2019s office didn\u2019t dispute Roys\u2019 claim directly, but said that under Walker the state is nowspending more state tax dollars on higher education overall-- including the UW System, the technical college system and other funds--than it did in 2011. Our rating Roys said that in 2011 under Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent \"more on our prison system than we did\" on the University of Wisconsin System. She\u2019s correct. That occurred with Walker\u2019s first state budget, for 2011-\u201913, when he directed more state taxpayer dollars to the Department of Corrections than the UW System. But the eclipse was years in the making before Walker took office, and it\u2019s worth noting that the UW System, with tuition and federal grants, has a much larger total budget than Corrections. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Editor's note: We revised this item on Jan. 12, 2018 to indicate that the governor's office did respond to our request for information. The response had been inadvertently overlooked when this fact check was first posted.",

        "claim": "CNN used footage from Canada while reporting on an explosion in Lviv on March 26.",
        "doc": "CNN's coverage showed firefighters at the Lviv explosion site wearing protective gear that read \"Edmonton\" because Edmonton firefighters donated it. Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, much misinformation is spreading online. For example, in Don Lemon's segment of CNN's news coverage of the airstrike aftermath in Lviv on March 26, 2022, a firefighter can be seen wearing protective gear with the word \"Edmonton\" on it. This image caused doubt among social media users, and they slammed CNN for alleged false representation of the explosion location. Some even said that CNN might have reported the story on location in Canada because Edmonton is a Canadian city. However, this claim is false. CNN has not depicted the wrong location with its live coverage. It reported the incident from the airstrike location near Lviv on March 26. On the same day, Firefighter Aid Ukraine (FAU), a Canadian organization, posted a screenshot from the CNN coverage on its official Facebook page. The image shows firefighters in the background attempting to put out the fire. Among them, a firefighter could be seen wearing a protective coat with the word \"Edmonton\" inscribed on it. The organization acknowledged in the caption that the firefighters near Lviv were utilizing gear donated by Edmonton firefighters. FAU has provided critical firefighter equipment to Ukraine for almost a decade, as confirmed by FAU project director Kevin Royle, who told CTV News Edmonton that the arrangement has been in place for \"almost eight years.\" The organization has been volunteering at a Ukraine donation warehouse in Edmonton. In a tweet, CNN reporter Daniel Dale quoted Royle, saying that city markings on donated gear are stripped most of the time, and sometimes they aren't. In a Facebook post the next day, Royle acknowledged that CNN reached out to him to clarify this.",

        "doc": "The first two versions of the item quoted below began appearing on the Internet in August 2008. One asserted the story was harvested from the Los Angeles Times; the other that the fire happened in New Jersey. Variant versions soon began popping up all over: [Collected via e-mail, September 2008] Fire in LA [as reported in the LA Times 8/1/2008] A fire was reported in a three family house mid-morning Wednesday last week. There were many fatalities. On the first floor lived a black family \u2013 6 fatalities.On the second floor lived a Mexican family \u2013 13 fatalities.On the third floor lived a white family of 2 \u2013 no fatalities. A reporter at the scene made headlines with this story. Immediately the fire chief and his department were attacked by NAACP, Jesse Jackson and other black rights groups, as well as, the Mexican Consulate as being racist in their handling of the fire and loss of life issues. There was some unsettling discomfort when questioned further the fire chief explained why the family on the third floor survived the fire and the others did not. His only response was, \u201cThey were at work!\u201d Did you hear about the fire in the three family house in New Jersey ? A black family of six lived on the first floor. They all perished in the fire.A Mexican family of eight lived on the second floor. They also perished.A white couple lived on the third floor. They survived. Jesse Jackson, demanded to know why the whites survived when the others didn\u2019t. The fire chief said the answer was simple. The white couple were at work when the fire broke out. In South Los Angeles, a fire destroyed a fourplex. A Nigerian family of six con artists lived on the first floor, and all six died in the fire. An Islamic group of seven Kenyan welfare cheats, all illegally in the country, lived on the second floor, and they, too, all perished in the fire. Six LA, Hispanic, heavy-duty, ex-cons lived on the 3rd floor and they too, died. One white couple lived on the top floor. The couple survived the fire. Jesse Jackson, John Burris and Al Sharpton were furious. They flew into LA and quickly demanded a meeting with the fire chief. On camera, they loudly demanded to know why the Blacks, Black Muslims and Hispanics all died in the fire and only the white couple lived. The fire chief quietly replied, \u201cSimple \u2014 they were away at work.\u201d In a run-down part of East London recently, a fire destroyed a dilapidated four storey house that had been divided into four flats.. * A Nigerian family of six internet con artists and full time benefit cheats lived on the first floor, and all six tragically perished in the fire. * A group of seven Islamic welfare cheats, all illegally in the country, lived on the second floor, and they too, all perished in the fire. * Six Albanian, gang banger, ex-cons \u2013 all claiming political asylum and living off the state for free \u2013 occupied the 3rd floor and they too, died. * And one middle aged British white couple lived on the top floor. They miraculously survived the fire. The Equal Opportunities Commission, Amnesty International, Human Rights activists, black community leaders and the British Islamic Council were all furious at the apparent racial inequality of the situation. Why were just the British white couple saved? It was monstrous they claimed, and showed that systemic \u2018racism\u2019 still existed in all areas of public service \u2013 questions were raised in the House of Commons, the popular media picked up the story and within hours it was national and indeed international news. Boris Johnson \u2013 Mayor of London, when questioned stated calmly that it would be unwise to jump to conclusions until the Police and Fire Service had completed their report. He closed by stating that he expected their initial assessment would be available within the next 36 hours \u2013 so perhaps it would be best to let the experts gather the evidence and report back before he commented any further. The baying Press pack subsequently reported the interview in such way as to intimate that the Mayor was indifferent to suffering and was out of touch with the feelings of the whole East London community! A large motorcade of representatives from all five groups, together with Jacquie Smith \u2013 the Home Secretary drove to the area and demanded a meeting with the local chief fire officer. They made sure that a large pack of popular Press and TV had been briefed on the visit and so the motorcade was met by a huge gaggle of journalists, TV interviewers and cameras. On camera, they loudly demanded to know why the Africans, Black Muslims and Albanians all died in the fire and only the white couple lived. The chief fire officer quietly replied \u2013 \u201cThey were at work.\u201d No such news account was published in the Los Angeles Times on 1 August 2008 (the date given in one form of the message), nor could we find any report of a fire in New Jersey from that timeframe which matched this tale. The titles given the piece (e.g., \u201cGood ole Jesse\u201d and \u201cJesse Jackson outraged in NJ\u201d) provide the context for the fiction: It\u2019s a swipe at those who are regarded as constantly soapboxing about the hardships unfairly visited upon minorities while simultaneously turning a blind eye to the life choices that might contribute to their less-advantaged state. At first blush, says the item, while it might appear one demographic received preferential treatment (the Mexican and black families perished in the fire, yet the white family survived, implying that firefighters pushed themselves to rescue the light-skinned folks while leaving the dwelling\u2019s darker-hued occupants to fend for themselves), upon further examination it was the lifestyles of the people involved that led to the outcomes described \u2014 the Mexicans and blacks burned to a crisp because they were ne\u2019er-do-wells lazing about during the day rather than being at work or at school, while the white couple escaped harm because the process of earning a living absented them from the scene of tragedy. The blacks and Mexicans are portrayed not only as shiftless but also as having reproduced like bunnies (the black family loses six members, the Mexican eight or thirteen), while the white family, by contrast, has only two members (both gainfully employed) and is therefore positioned as morally superior. The third version ups the ante by adding a \u201cNigerian family of con artists\u201d (as to why Nigerians would be presented as such, our articles about the Nigerian and \u201ccard not present\u201d scams explain all), \u201can Islamic group of seven Kenyan welfare cheats\u201d who are all illegal immigrants, and morphs the Mexican family of eight or thirteen people into \u201cSix LA, Hispanic, heavy-duty, ex-cons.\u201d The fourth version transports the fire to London, changes the \u201cNigerian family of con artists\u201d to \u201ca Nigerian family of six internet con artists and full time benefit cheats,\u201d alters \u201cseven Kenyan welfare cheats\u201d into \u201cseven Islamic welfare cheats,\u201d and morphs the heavy-duty Hispanic L.A. ex-cons into Albanian gang-banger ex-cons, throwing in for good measure their \u201cclaiming political asylum and living off the state for free.\u201d Such characterizations position those who perished as harms to society while they were here, thus positioning the outcry raised over their loss by Jesse Jackson and others as even more ludicrous.",

        "claim": "Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott \"subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools.\"",
        "doc": "U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson says that under Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s leadership, Florida has fallen short on education funding. \"Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools,\" Nelson\u2019s campaign said in a September Facebook post on the page Not for Florida. A narrator in the attached video makes the timeframe a little more clear, saying \"when Rick Scott became governor he subtracted more than $1 billion from local public schools.\" Beside the words \"$1.3 billion\" in Florida ink, there\u2019s a citation for a 2013 PolitiFact fact-check. Scott, the Republican challenging Nelson in November, has defended his education funding record. We found Nelson is cherry-picking Scott\u2019s record on education funding by zeroing in on his first year and ignoring the next several years. The video cites our fact-check of former Gov. Charlie Crist, who unsuccessfully sought his old job against Scott in 2014. Crist said Scott \"cut education by $1.3 billion\" \u2014 in his first year\u2014 which we rated Mostly True. Nelson\u2019s ad focused on Scott\u2019s budget but left out what happened with the next seven budgets Scott signed. As Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included billions of dollars in spending cuts, including to education. The Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts. The $1.3 billion figure included the reduction in state money and the expiration of the federal stimulus funds, which was the largest chunk of the cut. By the end of his first year, Scott changed his tune on education funding. He called for a $1 billion boost to education. The K-12 budget has since risen every year of Scott\u2019s tenure, whether we count total K-12 funds or only the state share. Scott\u2019s spokesman pointed to the fact that the total state share of K-12 funds rose from $8.7 billion in his first year to $11.9 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $3.2 billion. Fiscal year Total K-12 state share Total K-12 funds K-12 enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $9.7 billion $18.7 billion 2.63 million $7,126 2008-09 $8.6 billion $17.9 billion 2.62 million $6,846 2009-10 $8.1 billion $18 billion 2.63 million $6,846 2010-11 $8.91 billion $18.2 billion 2.64 million $6,897 2011-12* $8.71 billion $16.6 billion 2.67 million $6,217 2012-13 $9.5 billion $17.2 billion 2.7 million $6,376 2013-14 $10.5 billion $18.3 billion 2.705 million $6,769 2014-15 $10.7 billion $18.9 billion 2.74 million $6,915 2015-16 $10.93 billion $19.7 billion 2.77 million $7,105 2016-17 $11.3 billion $20.2 billion 2.8 million $7,196 2017-18 $11.6 billion $20.6 billion 2.82 million $7,221 2018-19 $11.9 billion $21.1 billion 2.8 million $7,407 * Scott\u2019s first budget. The $21.1 billion for K-12 schools approved earlier this year included an increase of about $485 million, including for school safety following the Parkland shooting. While Scott has promoted the increases each year, his critics have said that the state\u2019s education budget is underfunded and pointed out that Florida ranks 41st in per student expenditures nationwide. As we\u2019ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state\u2019s total K-12 education budget hasincreased in raw dollars every year for the last several years. However, adjusting for inflation, wefound per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues. Nelson\u2019s campaign said in a Facebook post that \"Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools.\" Nelson is repeating a familiar attack line against Scott, but this attack has become increasingly inaccurate as we get further away from Scott\u2019s first year in office. Scott did oversee a $1.3 billion education cut, in 2011.Over the next seven years with Scott as governor, theeducation budget grew each year. That's severe cherry-picking.Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate itMostly False.",

His latest theory takes the cake. In a post on social media dumpster fire Parler, Lindell produced a new spin on the real reason behind the Capitol attack. \u201cThe rioters were hypnotized by antifa temptresses who hid psychoactive drugs in their vaginas,\u201d said Lindell. \u201cIf you look at the video, many of the rioters had crazed looks in their eyes.\u201d This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events.

Snopes has debunked several strands of that theory. However, the \u201cantifa temptresses\u201d quotation, attributed to Lindell, was fabricated. Although the Business Standard News carries a \u201csatire\u201d disclaimer on its website, it does not appear on every article. As a result, screenshots of the fake Lindell article spread widely on social media, without a warning that its contents were made up and intended to be humorous. To illustrate the popularity of the article, the following is a selection of screenshots (all without any \u201csatire\u201d disclaimer) posted and shared on Facebook in February 2021: For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",

        "doc": "On July 31, 2019, Axios published a report about the fundraising efforts of pro-Donald Trump super PAC America First Action and its affiliated 501(c)(4) nonprofit, America First Policies. The news outlet found that these organizations had jointly raised more than $17 million during the first six months of 2019, thanks in part to donations from PAC Chairwoman Linda McMahon ($1 million), Chicago Cubs Co-Owner Marlene Ricketts ($500,000), and the company Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. ($250,000). The donation from Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that manufacturers Bang Energy, caught the attention of the website Popular Information. On Aug. 1, that website elaboratedon Axios\u2019 findings in an article entitled: \u201cEvery can of (Bang Energy) drink helps Trump get re-elected\u201d: Every can of this energy drink helps Trump get re-elected If you\u2019ve ever spent any time on Instagram, you\u2019ve probably run into one of the ubiquitous sponsored posts promoting Bang energy drink. In the ads, models in garish Bang-branded gear promote the benefits of drinking Bang or just try to look appealing while posing with a Bang beverage. These ads are working. Bang\u2019s sales grew over 780% in 2018. One thing these ads don\u2019t tell you: Every time you buy a can, you help Trump get re-elected. The notion that every purchase of a BANG Energy drink helps fund President Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign reached a wider audience a few days later when the following message was posted to Twitter: PSA: (just found this out) everyime you buy a BANG, a portion of your $$ is going towards the re-election fund campaign of Donald Trump. I know these taste ? af, but I can\u2019t be supporting a company that supports children in cages, no change on guns laws, etc. https://t.co/L1ulgP6val \u2014 ????? ??????$? (@Yungmdot) August 4, 2019 Both the Popular Information article and the aforementioned tweet exaggerated Bang\u2019s connection to the Trump campaign. Vital Pharmaceuticals did donate $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC in March 2019. But that is not the same as Bang Energy donating a portion of every product sold to Trump\u2019s re-election effort. Bang has no advertising campaign promising to donate a portion of sales to fund Trump\u2019s re-election. Furthermore, the Pharmaceuticals donation appears to have been for one time only. We found no record of that company donating to any pro-Trump super PACs during the 2016 presidential election. Also, no evidence exists that this donation was directly tied to Bang Energy sales, now or in the future. That said, Vital Pharmaceuticals and Bang Energy founder and CEO Jack Owoc has been a vocal supporter of the president: @realDonaldTrump Your brilliance has fueled the most epic turn of events in the history of politics. God bless the inevitable \u2013 Trump wins! \u2014 Jack Owoc (@BangEnergyCEO) March 14, 2016 He is also friends (or at least friendly) with President Trump\u2019s son Don Jr. and his girlfriend and television personality Kimberly Guilfoyle.

        "claim": "More than 100,000 women in Texas \"have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone.\"",
        "doc": "On the opening day of the Virginia General Assembly, abortion rights advocates held a news conference to urge lawmakers to sign a \"statement of intent in support of women\u2019s health and rights.\" Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, said it\u2019s time to stop an avalanche of abortion restrictions that have been approved in Virginia and across the nation during the past five years and that she said are threatening women\u2019s health. \"Recently, research out of Texas revealed that due to the rapidly declining number of women\u2019s health centers in that state, over 100,000 women - 100,000 women - have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone,\" Keene said. \"This is what happens when you shame and degrade women,\" she added. \"You encourage hateful, violent rhetoric and attack the fundamental rights of women.\" We wondered whether her jaw-dropping figure - more than 100,000 Texas women in one year attempted self-abortion - is correct. Keene referred us to a November 2015 report by the Texas Policy EvaluationProject at the University of Texas, a research group that focuses on the impact of the state\u2019s reproductive laws. The organization conducted a survey of 779 Texas women ages 18 to 49 in December 2014 and January 2015. When the participants were asked whether they \"ever\" tried to end a pregnancy on their own, 1.7 percent said yes. The researchers were concerned that some of the women might not be willing to admit they\u2019ve tried to self-abort. So they also asked each participant whether her best friend \"ever\" tried to end a pregnancy by herself. The response: 1.8 percent said they were \"sure\" their best friend had done so, and another 2.3 percent \"suspected\" that had happened. The researchers concluded that the proportion of Texas women who have tried to self-abort falls somewhere between the 1.7 percent who said they did so and the 4.1 percent who said they either were sure or suspected their best friend had tried. That converts to somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 women ages 18 to 49 in the Lone Star State. Again, this is an estimate of the women who tried \"ever\" in their lives to self-abort. Keene makes a significant error in saying the research shows that more than 100,000 of the incidents occurred \"in the last year alone.\" The timing is important, because a number of pro-abortion groups are linking the study\u2019s figure to a series of abortion restrictions Texas enacted in 2013. The state banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy; required abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospital-style surgical centers; and mandated that a doctor have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she performs abortions. \"Definitely, the timing of most of the self-induced abortions is not connected to the legislation,\" said Daniel Grossman,who headed the research team. He told us he plans to continue surveying Texas women. \"To make any estimate whether self-abortion goes up because of these laws will take years to study,\" Grossman said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a challenge from reproductive rights groups that the laws block constitutional rights to an abortion. More than half of the 41 abortion clinics in Texas have closed since 2012, just before the legislation was introduced. The researchers noted that self-abortion rates are likely to be higher in Texas than in the rest of the nation, in part because of its shared border with Mexico where Misoprostol, a drug that effectively can end pregnancies, \"is often available in pharmacies without a prescription.\" Other methods reported by those who said they knew someone who attempted a self-induced abortion included herbs or homeopathic remedies; getting hit in the stomach; using alcohol or illegal drugs; and taking hormonal pills. Our ruling Keene said that \"due to the rapidly declining number of women\u2019s health care centers\" in Texas, more than \"100,000 women have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone.\" She\u2019s wrong. The study to which she refers estimates that between 100,000 and 240,000 Texas women ages 18 to 49 attempted to self-abort at some point in their lives. We don\u2019t mean to diminish that finding; it suggests a lot of women have put their health in danger. But lumping the women\u2019s efforts into the \"past year,\" Keene inaccurately places the blame for all self-abortion attempts on restrictions on abortion clinics that Texas passed in 2013. We rate her statement False.",

        "claim": "Article III, Section 4 of the Constitution holds a \"lame duck ... candidate\" cannot seek to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.",
        "doc": "The 13 February 2016 death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scaliaprompted a number of debates and rumors, mostly about who would fill his seat. Just hours after news broke of hisdeath, the subject was raised at a pre-scheduled Republican debate. Murmurs from some candidates that the appointment should be stalled until the end of President Obama\u2019s term quickly turned intopartisan bickering about election-year appointments. One of the rumors around Scalia\u2019s death and replacement was the aboveitem. Itstatedthat Article III, Section IV of the United States Constitution mandated \u201cthe Founding Fathers wrote \u2018the President may not nominate a candidate for the Supreme Court if the vacancy shall occur in the year leading up to an election, when the candidate be a \u2018lame duck\u2019 \u2026 [i]n thy cases, the voters shall select their nominee with their pick of the next president.\u201d Before even double checking, we could spot a number of red flags that stood out in the quoted text. First was that an elected president would never have been described as a \u201ccandidate,\u201d a term used to describe politicians seeking office and not an incumbent. Also, the terminology \u201clame duck\u201d had a distinctly anachronistic feel to it. A 2009Denver Post column suggested that the modern phrasedidn\u2019t exist while the Founding Fathers lived: In the American political sense, \u201clame duck\u201d was first used in 1863 in reference to \u201cbroken-down politicians,\u201d and the first president to be called a lame duck was Calvin Coolidge. However, it\u2019s not necessary to research the history of the phrase \u201clame duck\u201d to figure out whether or not there\u2019s any truth to this claim, because there is no Article III, Section IV to the United States Constitution. Other articles do have sections numbered four and higher, but Article III has only three sections.",

        "doc": "This item summarizing what proportions of common traits would be like if we could shrink the earth\u2019s population to a village of precisely 100 people has been circulated on the Internet for many years, and many readers seem to find the contrasts it highlights between the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d of the world compelling. However, much of the information it presented was questionable, out of date, or poorly-defined even when it was new, and the passage of time has only made it less accurate. Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2001] If we could shrink the earth\u2019s population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would look something like the following. There would be: \u2013 57 Asians\u2013 21 Europeans\u2013 14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south\u2013 8 Africans \u2013 52 would be female\u2013 48 would be male \u2013 70 would be non-white\u2013 30 would be white \u2013 70 would be non-Christian\u2013 30 would be Christian \u2013 89 would be heterosexual\u2013 11 would be homosexual \u2013 6 people would possess 59% of the entire world\u2019s wealth and all 6 would be from the United States. \u2013 80 would live in substandard housing \u2013 70 would be unable to read \u2013 50 would suffer from malnutrition \u2013 1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth \u2013 1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education \u2013 1 would own a computer Since we first wrote about this item back in 2000, all the information presented below is relative to conditions as they existed in that year: 57 Asians21 Europeans14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south8 Africans According to the United Nations World Population Prospects document, the world population in the year 2000 was about 6.7 billion, with this geographic distribution: \u2013 Africa: 794,000,000\u2013 Asia: 3,672,000,000\u2013 Latin America and Caribbean: 519,000,000\u2013 Europe: 727,000,000\u2013 North America: 314,000,000<\u2013 Oceania: 51,000,000 If we calculate the corresponding percentages (and lump North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Oceania into the \"western hemisphere\" category), we get the following ratios for our population of 100: \u2013 Asians: 60<\u2013 Europeans: 12<\u2013 Western Hemisphereans: 15 (9 Latin Americans/Caribbeans, 5 North Americans, 1 Oceanian)\u2013 Africans: 13 52 would be female48 would be male According to that same United Nations document, the world population in the year 2000 consisted of 3,051,099,000 men and 3,005,616,000 women, which (with a little rounding) breaks down to 50 men and 50 women in a population of 100. 70 would be non-white30 would be white Here we run into definitional problems trying to lump entire continents\u2019 worth of people into one class based on some nebulous concept of color. What makes a person \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cBlack\u201d? If we say that Africans are considered \u201cBlack,\u201d does that categorization apply equally to Nigerians, Egyptians, and South Africans? (Is the Middle East part of Africa or Asia?) Should the classification of Asians as \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cnon-white\u201d be based solely upon skin tone, or upon geographical and cultural factors as well? The numbers given here seem to be based upon the classification of Europeans and Western Hemisphereans as \u201cwhite\u201d and Africans and Asians as \u201cnon-white\u201d (and the assumption that those continents are homogeneous in racial composition). With those qualifications, a population of 100 (based on year 2000 numbers) would include 27 whites and 73 non-whites. 70 would be non-Christian30 would be Christian According to the chart at Adherents.com, which provides estimates of \u201cthe number of people who have at least a minimal level of self-identification as adherents\u201d of a particular religion, the world\u2019s population in early 2001 was 33% Christian. So, our reduced population of 100 would be composed of 33 Christians and 67 non-Christians. 89 would be heterosexual11 would be homosexual This one is almost impossible to estimate with any reasonable degree of accuracy. The classification of people as being either \u201cheterosexual\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d is too dependent upon subjective criteria, and the answers of respondents to surveys about their sexual habits are too easily influenced by other social factors. The common figure of \u201c10% of the population is homosexual\u201d is often bandied about, but that number is derived from a misapplication of a Kinsey study which was not based upon a representative sample of the population. One can find estimates that place of the percentage of the population considered to be homosexual anywhere between 1-2% and 25%-35%, but a reasonable survey of the more controlled studies would put the figure in about the 2-3% range (for males, at least). 6 people would possess 59% of the entire world\u2019s wealth, and all 6 would be from the United States. This claim demonstrates the precariousness of trying to summarize a very large, diverse population in a few simple statistics. For starters, our miniature world of 100 people only includes 5 people from all of North America, so any statement involving 6 people from the United States just doesn\u2019t compute. \u201cWealth\u201d is a concept difficult to measure with any precision, but we can use Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a reasonable approximation. If we take some figures from the CIA\u2019s World Factbook 2000, we find that the estimated GDP of the United States in 1999 was $9.255 trillion, out of a world total of $40.7 trillion. In other words, in 1999 the United States possessed about 23% of the world\u2019s wealth. If we assume that all 5 North Americans in our miniature world are from the United States, and that they have inherited an amount of wealth proportional to that held by the United States in the \u201creal\u201d world, together they\u2019d still have only 23% of the world\u2019s wealth, not 59%. Even if you could find some combination of 6 people in our putative population of 100 who held 59% of the total wealth, they wouldn\u2019t all be from the United States. 80 would live in substandard housing This statement can\u2019t be assessed without knowing the definition of \u201csubstandard\u201d being employed here. \u201cSubstandard\u201d by whose standards? And if a full 80% of the world\u2019s population truly lives in \u201csubstandard\u201d housing, doesn\u2019t that indicate whatever standard is being used must be too high? Estimates for this figure are all over the map as well (some United Nations housing statistics are informative but don\u2019t really answer the question), but a 1999 article in International Wildlife puts the estimate at 33%, not the 80% figure offered here. 70 would be unable to read A 1998 UNICEF study put the world illiteracy rate at 16%, well short of the 70% claimed here. 50 would suffer from malnutrition The World Health Organization puts the malnutrition figure at about 33%. 1 would be near death1 would be near birth This statement is simply too vague to evaluate. At any given time, one person in a hundred is near death? Just how \u201cnear\u201d? Is age a factor in this statistic? 1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education Again, we have to know whether our miniature world\u2019s inhabitants represent current population trends in age as well as other factors. According to the United Nations World Population Prospects document, the median age of the world\u2019s population was 26.5 in 2000, with that figure being lower in less developed (and more populous) areas of the world. (The median age of Africans, for example, was only 18.4 in 2000.) So, this statistic could be true simply because much of our miniature population would be too young to have finished college yet (assuming that \u201chaving a college education\u201d means \u201cgraduated with the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d). However, if we assume everyone in our miniature world is of sufficient age and apply the current graduation rates of the USA (33%) to its share of the population (5), we\u2019d have almost two college graduates from America alone. And other parts of the world (e.g., New Zealand, Netherlands, Britain, and Norway) have graduation rates equal to or higher than the USA\u2019s. 1 would own a computer Computer ownership rates in the USA now indicate that over 50% of American households have computers, so if we assume that \u201chouseholds\u201d can be equated with \u201cpeople\u201d in our miniature world, our 5 Americans alone would have at least two computers between them.",

        "claim": "\"Seventy-four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person-one vote.\"",
        "doc": "Should we change the way we pick our president? That was the issue June 13, 2013, when the Rhode Island House of Representatives debated a proposal that would give all four of the state's electoral votes to whomever won the popular vote nationwide in a presidential election, regardless of whether the majority of Rhode Islanders voted for that candidate. The change is designed to bypass the Electoral College system, which encourages candidates to devote the vast majority of their energy to swing states, where the race is close. States like Rhode Island, where the Democratic candidate typically wins, are ignored. The proposal would not take effect until enough states -- enough to represent a majority of all electoral votes -- agree to the plan. Both the House and Senate have passed comparable versions of the bill but they have to agree on at least one chamber's version before it can go to the governor. During the House debate, Rep. Raymond Gallison, a Democrat from Bristol, asserted that the \"National Popular Vote\" initiative has widespread support in Rhode Island. \"Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote,\" Gallison said. Getting 74 percent of Rhode Islanders to agree on anything controversial would be an accomplishment. But because we had never heard of a poll -- recent or otherwise -- on the issue, we asked Gallison for his source. He told us he would get back to us. Meanwhile, we checked around. We could find only one poll where Rhode Islanders were asked about the topic. It was on the website of National Popular Vote Inc., a \"social welfare\" nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that paid for the survey. The poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Democrats tend to favor popular vote proposals. The question: \"There is a proposal to change the way we elect the President. The current system elects a President based on the state-by-state vote totals. The new proposal would switch to a system that elects the President according to the vote totals in all 50 states. Would you generally support or oppose switching to a system that counts the votes in all 50 states combined?\" As Gallison reported, 74 percent who responded supported electing the President by a purely popular vote. The margin of error was plus/minus 3.5 percent. But there are a few things to note. The poll was done five years ago. Nobody was interviewed for the survey. The data from 800 registered Rhode Island voters were collected by robocalls, where people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people were hanging up without answering. Jim Williams, a polling analyst with Public Policy Polling, which did the survey, said about 9 out of every 10 people called typically hang up without answering a question. Perhaps most important, there was no ability for residents to indicate that they were undecided or didn't care. They had two choices: \"support\" or \"oppose.\" Historically, 12 to 15 percent of the population has had no opinion on the subject, according to older Gallup surveys listed on National Popular Vote's website. Patrick Rosenstiel, spokesman for National Popular Vote, said the survey was designed to force a choice. \"We didn't offer an 'undecided' or 'don't know' because a legislator, when the bill comes before them, can't be undecided. They've got to vote green or vote red,\" he said. The difference is that legislators have time to gather the facts, pro or con, before they are expected to make a choice. The poll offered no such guidance. When Gallison got back to us, he told us that his information came from that 2008 survey. We found a more recent Gallup poll on the question, conducted in October 2011. It posed the question in a way to help ensure that the wording did not affect the outcome and it allowed \"undecided\" as an option. In that survey, 62 percent supported a national popular vote and 35 percent endorsed keeping the Electoral College system. The rest were undecided. (The margin of error was plus/minus percentage points.) Sixty-two percent is a far cry from 74 percent. But that was a national survey, and Gallison was talking about Rhode Island. Rhode Islanders might feel differently because the Ocean State tends to be awash in Democrats, and Democrats favor the popular vote option. When Gallup only looked at the results for Democrats nationwide, the level of support was 71 percent. During his floor speech, Gallison said 74 percent of Rhode Islanders supported a popular vote because they believed in the concept of one person, one vote. Yet the automated survey didn't ask respondents to give a reason. When we asked Gallison about that, he said his statement was based on comments he had received from constituents who wanted him to vote in favor of the plan. Our ruling Rep. Raymond Gallison said, \"Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote.\" In the first half of his statement, he was correctly quoting a single five-year-old robocall poll from a special interest group in which respondents only had two options to choose from. Those who didn't know or didn't care either had to either pick an answer -- without the ability to hear arguments pro or con -- or just hang up, as most people do with such surveys. Nonetheless, other surveys have shown a high level of support for a national popular vote, even if it's not quite as high as the percentage quoted by Gallison. The second half of his statement implied that Rhode Islanders had been polled about their reasons for supporting the proposal. But the 2008 survey -- the one Gallison relied on -- never even posed that question. We can think of a few other reasons (such as wanting to bring more campaign money into Rhode Island) why residents might want a national popular vote. Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

The photo was attributed to United Press International (UPI), a leading news agency at that time, and not the U.S. government, and it was republished by several regional newspapers, along with the following caption: \u201cDr. Wernher von Braun, one of the leaders in America\u2019s space flight program, took a walk on the moon as he strolled through an exact replica of the Apollo 11 moon landing after officially opening the exhibition at Atlanta\u2019s Southeastern Fair.\u201d Previewing the fair, on Sept. 1, 1969, the Atlanta Constitution reported: A detailed reenactment of man\u2019s first walk on the moon, including authentic moon surface with small craters and flat rocks and a replica of the landing module will be a major attraction at this year\u2019s Southeastern Fair, opening Sept. 25. A tableau of the actual moon walk will be staged in the administration building of the fair, which has been cleared to make way for concrete, sand and other materials needed to build an authentic moon surface down to the minute details, including the footprints of the astronauts. The next month, the Atlanta Constitution followed up with an article that included a photograph of two local gardening enthusiasts \u201cplanting\u201d flowers on that same replica moon surface: The photograph is also not \u201cbanned\u201d or available only on the \u201cdeep web.\u201d It is readily available online, searchable through search engines, and posted to mainstream social networks: ",

        "claim": "\"Overall, the economy is estimated to have expanded by 7.6% in 2021, a much stronger level from the contraction of 0.3% in 2020.\"",
        "doc": "The budget statement was correct about Kenya's revenue growth over the past eight years, as well as increased earnings from the tourism sector and the number of schools built by the administration. Despite also getting the growth in green energy sources and the number of title deeds issued by the government since 2013 mostly right, the minister was way off the mark with the majority of his claims. Yatani's claims about economic growth, inflation declines, a better police officer to citizen ratio, and the extent to which power generation has increased were all incorrect. Kenya's finance minister recently outlined the country's spending plans in what was the final budget statement of president Uhuru Kenyatta 's administration. Ukur Yatani made several claims in his speech, many of which resembled a scorecard of Kenyatta's tenure. The president will step down after the August 2022 elections, having been in office since 2013. Yatani's speech covered several areas, from the economy and jobs to policing, health and education. We checked the numbers. We contacted the national treasury's spokesperson for the evidence for the minister's claims. We will update this report once we receive his response. Yatani said the Kenyan economy had \"staged a strong recovery in 2021\", having weathered the shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when it contracted by 0.3%. He gave the estimated growth for 2021 as 7.6%. But the national statistics office is yet to publish data for the year. Vincent Kimosop is the founder of Sovereign Insight, a strategy and policy thinktank in Nairobi. He has also worked with the Kenyan government . To evaluate this claim, he referred us to the quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) reports published by the statistics office. The most recent report showed an average growth rate of 7.9% from January to September 2021. The treasury also published a similar figure in February 2022 . Kimosop attributed the growth to the momentum generated by the lifting of lockdown restrictions. \"It is basically increased production that is attributed to increased engagement and activity in the economy. When you look at it from that perspective you will understand why that level of growth was recorded,\" Kimosop said. As Yatani also said, the growth is a result of recovery. But in the absence of publicly available data on growth in the last quarter of 2021 or clarification from his office, we rate his claim unproven. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Gross domestic product (GDP) is a widely used measure of a country's economy. It is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. Official data shows Kenya's economy was valued at KSh4.7 trillion in 2013. The minister's figure of KSh5.3 trillion was only attained a year later. In February 2022, the national treasury provisionally estimated 2022 GDP as KSh12.6 trillion. After his budget speech , Yatani tabled a summary showing the same figure. None of his GDP figures for either 2013 or 2022 are supported by publicly available information. In March 2022 we fact-checked a claim by Kenyatta that the economy more than doubled during his administration. We found this to be misleading . Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. Photo: AFP/TONY KARUMBA Yatani's claim of a 155% increase in the economy's size, which he described as a \"monumental milestone\", also leaves out key context. During Kenyatta's administration the GDP was rebased twice, in 2014 and in 2021 . Yatani also omitted the increase in the country's public debt which analysts say has driven the bulk of economic activity as measured by GDP. GDP 'not a measure of societal progress' But there are also challenges with using GDP to show gains, Margarida Domingues de Carvalho, who works with Eurostat , the statistical office of the European Union , told Africa Check. \"GDP is often misinterpreted as a measure of societal progress and well-being, which it is not,\" she said in an email. \"GDP and GDP growth only give indications on the size and dynamics of an economy, but say nothing about, for example, the distribution of income and wealth or possible adverse environmental effects of the economic activity.\" Yatani gets the growth figures for 2013 and 2022 wrong, leaves out important context, and inaccurately uses GDP to signal progress. \u2013 Makinia Juma The country's statistics bureau publishes data on the number of jobs created in its annual economic survey. We checked the surveys released in 2018 and 2020 . New jobs created from 2013 to 2019 Economic survey 2018 Economic survey 2020 2013 755,800 2014 802,200 2015 844,500 847,300 2016 832,000 807,100 2017 897,800 905,900 2018 824,900 2019 846,300 As seen in the table, there are discrepancies in the numbers. But the total falls between 5.79 and 5.8 million jobs created between 2013 and 2019. The most recent survey was published in 2021. It showed that as of June 2020, the number of jobs shed due to the pandemic was 737,500. Cumulatively, that would reduce the jobs created in the period to 5 million. There were also reports of more job losses in 2021. But without data for this year, we cannot fully evaluate the minister's claim . \u2013 Grace Gichuhi Inflation measures \"how much more expensive a set of goods and services has become over a certain period of time, usually a year\", according to the International Monetary Fund . We looked at economic survey data to track inflation. Average annual inflation rates from 2013 to 2021 Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Inflation (%) 9.4 5.7 6.9 6.6 6.3 8 8 5.3 5.4 6.1 Sources: Economic surveys 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , 2019 , 2020 , 2021 and the quarterly economic and budget review report of February 2022. The average annual inflation rate was 5.7% in 2013 , not 7.2% as the minister claimed . In 2021, a treasury report showed inflation was 6.1% . Inflation did not decline, in fact it rose from 5.7% in 2013 to 8% in 2018. The most recent data shows that it was 6.1% in 2021, higher than it was in 2013. \u2013 Tess Wandia Kenya's central bank defines remittances as \"money sent by a person in a foreign land to his or her home country\". The bank records remittances using the US currency. For 2013, remittances were valued at US$1.29 billion . For 2021 they were $3.72 billion. The change between the two figures is 188%. However, in Kenyan currency, and using the average exchange rates for the two years , the increase worked out to 279%, which is not very far from the minister's 300%. But there are two important caveats. First, the Kenyan shilling has sharply depreciated against the US dollar in that period. Second, the central bank has data up to February 2022, not the whole year as per the minister's statement . \u2013 Dancan Bwire Ordinary revenue includes all taxes collected by the country's tax authority plus the appropriation-in-aid. Appropriation-in-aid refers to \"revenue in the form of receipts from user charges, collected by ministries or departments that is over and above the required amount and is spent by the entity that raised the revenue\". National treasury data showed the total ordinary revenue was KSh875.5 billion in 2012/13. During his budget speech Yatani tabled a document showing the actual revenue for the 2020/21 financial year was KSh1.8 trillion. In the previous three financial years, revenue rose from KSh1.5 trillion to KSh1.8 trillion. The tax authority has attributed the increased revenue to using technology, public awareness and an expansion of the tax base. We therefore rate Yatani's claim as correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenya's national statistics office does not release data on poverty annually, analysts have told Africa Check. The most recent official statistics , released in 2018, had data for 2015/16. This defines \"overall poverty\" as households and individuals whose monthly expenditure \"is less than KSh3,252 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh5,995 in core-urban areas\". It gives the national poverty headcount rate as 36.1%, a fall from the 2005/06 rate of 46.6% Therefore, in 2013, the available data had the poverty rate at 46.6%. In 2019, the data showed it was 36.1%. In 2021, the Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis , a government thinktank, said more Kenyans had fallen into poverty as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The thinktank estimated the 2019 poverty rate at 28.9% and the 2020 rate at 41.9%. None of these estimates support the minister's claim . \u2013 Tess Wandia The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. Before 2013, data on the number of all police officers in Kenya was not publicly available. The economic survey only published the numbers for the Kenya police service, but left out the administration police service. However, in 2013 when Kenyatta took office there were 75,325 police officers in Kenya, according to the national police service . That year Kenya's population was 41.8 million, official data shows . This made for a police-to-population ratio of one officer for every 555 people. The most recent economic survey put the number of police officers at 100,481 in 2020, while the estimated population was 48.7 million , for a police-to-population ratio of 1:485. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. \u2013 Tess Wandia Kenya's statistics agency publishes figures on the country's power generation. The data comes from the electricity utility Kenya Power and the power-generating company KenGen . In 2013, the country had 1,717 megawatts (MW ) in installed capacity according to the economic surveys for 2014 and 2015. Installed capacity refers to the maximum capacity that the electricity system is designed to run at. Kenya Power put the figure at 1,765 MW as of 30 June 2013. The closest to Yatani's figure of 1,300 MW was in 2009 when it was at 1,311 MW . According to the most recent economic survey , the country's installed capacity was 2,836.7 MW in 2020. Kenya Power's most recent annual report showed that Kenya had 2,984 MW in installed capacity as at 30 June 2021, a figure also cited by the energy regulator, the Energy Petroleum Regulatory Authority . We therefore rate this claim as incorrect . \u2013 Makinia Juma Yatani said green sources currently account for 73% of Kenya's installed power generation capacity. These sources include geothermal, wind, solar and hydro power. The most recent data from the country's state-owned utility, Kenya Power, showed a total installed capacity of 2,984 MW in 2021 broken down as follows: Green energy sources in Kenya (2021) in MW Source Hydro Geothermal Wind Solar Total from green sources Total installed capacity % of green sources 2021 838.4 863 436.1 90.3 2,227.8 2,984 74.7% We rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma According to the lands ministry , the government issued 5.1 million title deeds from 2013 to 2021. From 2013 to April 2020, 4.4 million titles were issued . At least 1.26 million deeds were given out from 2018 to April 2020. Africa Check previously asked the lands minister for data on title deeds issued since April 2020 but has not yet received a response. Only the ministry can confirm the number of deeds it has issued, the Kenya Land Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation that advocates for land reform in the country, told Africa Check. Yatani's claim that the current administration has issued 5.3 million title deeds over the last eight years is mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma Data from the national statistics office showed that in 2013, Kenya earned KSh94 billion from tourism. The most recent data showed that earnings were KSh163.6 billion in 2019. The increase is 74%. Tourism receipts dropped to KSh91.7 billion in 2020 due to rules that restricted travel because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Kenyan tourism earnings from 2013 to 2019 Year Amount, billions 2013 93.97 2014 87.08 2015 84.60 2016 99.69 2017 119.90 2018 157.38 2019 163.55 Yatani's claim is correct. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi According to the economic survey 2021 , hospital bed numbers increased from 64,844 in 2016 to 82,091 in 2020, a 9.6% increase. The statistics bureau said its data was from the Kenya Master Health Facility List , an application with all health facilities and community units in the country, compiled by the health ministry . Hospital beds in Kenya 2016 to 2020 Year Hospital beds Increase 2016 64,844 - 2017 67,195 2,351 2018 71,601 4,406 2019 74,868 3,267 2020 82,091 7,223 Source: Kenya National Bureau of Statistics We were however unable to find data from 2013 to 2015, making it difficult to verify the claim. We have contacted the health ministry and will update this report with their response. Until then, we rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Data from the education ministry shows Kenya had 26,549 primary schools in 2012. The number increased to 32,437 in 2020, according to the national statistics office. The data also shows secondary schools increased from 7,174 in 2012 to 10,413 schools in 2020. Based on the available data, the claim is correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma In education, the term transition refers to the progression of students between different stages in the school system. It can be between grades within a given level, from one level to the next, and out of and back into schools. In Kenya, the transition rate refers to the movement from pre-school into primary, from primary to secondary education, and from secondary to tertiary institutions. Yatani's speech focused on the primary into secondary transition rate, where candidates who sat their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam subsequently joined secondary school. The 2016 economic survey puts the 2012 transition rate at 64.5%. The most recent data from the agency gave the transition rate for 2020 as 91%, a rise of 5.5 percentage points from 85.5% in 2019. The ministry's data confirms the transition rate in 2012 was at 64.5% but there isn't publicly available evidence yet to prove it's at 100% in 2022, as Yatani claimed. \u2013 Makinia Juma John Kinuthia is a senior programme officer with the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership , a global budget transparency organisation. He told Africa Check that per capita income is measured by looking at the average income per person in a country. \"So we look at total earnings then divide that by the total population. This is often used to gauge the standard of living in a country.\" Kinuthia directed us to gross national income per capita figures as published by Kenya's statistics office in its annual statistical abstract. The most recent abstract put the per capita gross national income at KSh125,845 for 2013, and gives a provisional figure of KSh217,200 in 2020. The data agency has not released figures for 2021. We can therefore only rate this claim as unproven. Kinuthia said there were varying opinions as to the usefulness of such measures in countries with large inequalities like Kenya. \"Those who make the most are very few,\" he said. This risked skewing the data. \u2013 Makinia Juma",

        "claim": "House Speaker \u201cKevin McCarthy has quietly implemented a pay raise for members (of Congress) that could be $30,000+ per person. It circumvents the Constitution by instead reimbursing their rent, utilities, & meals.\u201d",
        "doc": "Few issues make voters angrier than seeing taxpayer dollars used for salary increases for their political representatives. So, it\u2019s not surprising that a recent change in how the U.S. House of Representatives pays its members\u2019 expenses has drawn bipartisan criticism. Brian Tyler Cohen, a liberal commentator and podcast host, shared a screenshot of a tweet on Facebook, blaming House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, for the change. The May 3 post said McCarthy \"has quietly implemented a pay raise for members (of Congress) that could be $30,000+ per person. It circumvents the Constitution by instead reimbursing their rent, utilities, & meals.\" Cohen\u2019s post also was shared on Facebook by the liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats. Meanwhile, on the other side of the ideological spectrum, conservative commentator James Bovard wrote a New York Post column criticizing the same policy, without focusing on McCarthy\u2019s role. The House did change how lawmakers\u2019 expenses are reimbursed. However, it\u2019s not accurate to call the change a pay raise because it addresses reimbursements for expenses paid. Also, the change was approved with strong bipartisan support, and there\u2019s no evidence that the new policy \"circumvents the Constitution.\" Cohen did not respond to an inquiry for this article. House salaries, which are $174,000 for rank-and-file members and higher for a small number of top leaders, have remained constant since 2009, amid public pressure not to raise them. For lawmakers, serving in Congress exacts a financial burden: They either have to move full-time to the Washington, D.C., area and travel back to their districts regularly, or maintain living spaces both at home and in Washington. Both options are pricey. Over the years, some members of Congress have sought to save money by turning portions of their congressional offices into ad hoc bedrooms. One young member, newly elected Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., tweeted about his trouble finding an affordable place in Washington, D.C., saying, \"This ain\u2019t meant for people who don\u2019t already have money.\" Just applied to an apartment in DC where I told the guy that my credit was really bad. He said I\u2019d be fine. Got denied, lost the apartment, and the application fee. This ain\u2019t meant for people who don\u2019t already have money. In 2022, the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress \u2014 a bipartisan panel charged with improving how Congress functions \u2014 held a hearing at which former Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., said he left Congress because he couldn\u2019t financially afford continuing to serve. In its final report, the modernization committee sought to rectify this problem by supporting \"alignment\" of Congress\u2019 reimbursement policies with those in the private sector. In December 2022, without fanfare, the House Administration Committee approved a resolution, with no objections from its bipartisan membership, to amend the reimbursement rules in the members\u2019 Congressional Handbook. In March 2023, the House Administration Committee\u2019s new membership voted \u2014 again, unanimously and on a bipartisan basis \u2014 on the final wording changes in the handbook. Experts say that calling this a pay raise is dubious. Under the new rule, for the first time, lawmakers can seek reimbursement for living expenses incurred in the Washington, D.C., area, including rent, utilities and meals. The House\u2019s change addresses a situation familiar to private company workers who are sent to work in far-away locales. Most companies foot a reasonable array of expenses, such as hotel or rental costs, transportation and meals. Under most scenarios, it\u2019s considered reimbursement for expenses incurred on the company\u2019s behalf, not a pay raise. \"If by \u2018pay raise\u2019 Cohen means an increase in lawmakers' fixed regular salary \u2014 which would be the commonsense definition of the term \u2014 then no, it is not a pay raise,\" said Matthew Green, a Catholic University of America political scientist. \"The word \u2018implemented\u2019 implies that Speaker McCarthy initiated or enacted this,\" Green said. \"That would be false.\" The changes were initiated when Democrats held the majority and were subsequently implemented by the new Republican majority. The process moved forward in two separate committees with bipartisan support. \"The effort to make sure that Members are reimbursed for housing expenses has been bipartisan in nature from the very beginning,\" said the chamber\u2019s top Democrat, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. After the policy change became widely known, lawmakers from both parties told Fox News that the new policy was good. \"It makes a lot of sense,\" said Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla, said, \"Congress was out of line with traditional workplace reimbursement structures.\" Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said, \"There are a lot of Members who are having a hard time with expenses. So I think it was probably needed.\" That figure likely stems from a New York Times estimate it said was based on current government reimbursement rates, and it\u2019s plausible, but not certain. The lawmakers\u2019 reimbursements will derive from the existing pots of money allocated to each member of Congress for staff salaries, equipment and other office needs. So, lawmakers will have to choose between reimbursing their own Washington, D.C., living expenses or using that money to pay staff or for other office costs. For that reason, some lawmakers may choose not to use it to reimburse themselves. Another factor they may consider is that any reimbursements would be taxable. The rule also requires public disclosure of the reimbursements, said Demian Brady, vice president of research at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. This could discourage maximum use. \"Lots of jobs offer reimbursement for expenses up to a certain maximum, without employees actually reaching that maximum in their expenses,\" Green said. The relevant portion of the Constitution is the 27th Amendment, which was ratified in 1992. It says, \"No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.\" In other words, if Congress passes a law to increase its pay, it must take effect with the next Congress. Green said that because the rule change was not a law, \"the 27th Amendment doesn't apply.\" Even if the change were a law, he said, \"the key phrase in the 27th Amendment is \u2018compensation for \u2026 services.\u2019\" Green believes it could be strongly argued that reimbursement for expenses does not qualify as compensation for services. Cohen wrote that McCarthy \"has quietly implemented a pay raise for members (of Congress) that could be $30,000+ per person. It circumvents the Constitution by instead reimbursing their rent, utilities, & meals.\" The House\u2019s rule change is not accurately described as a pay raise. Rather, for the first time, lawmakers can be reimbursed for living expenses in Washington, D.C., the same type of reimbursements that private-sector employers regularly give workers. And the reimbursements will have to come from the existing pot of money congressional members are given to pay for office staff and other expenses. There is no \"pay raise.\" McCarthy did not spearhead the change. It was set in motion when Democrats controlled Congress and advanced through two committees with strong bipartisan support. The 27th Amendment bars lawmakers from passing a law that raises their pay, but the change wasn\u2019t to a law. It\u2019s also unclear whether the newly allowable reimbursements would qualify as compensation prohibited by the amendment. Cohen refers to a real change the House made in recent months, but he mischaracterizes it in several ways. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "In Rhode Island, \"Nearly 9 percent of covered employees go out on short term disability every year, with an average outage from work of almost 12 weeks each.\"",
        "doc": "Ken Block, Republican candidate for governor, is taking aim at Rhode Island\u2019s temporary disability insurance program, saying it\u2019s poorly run and too expensive. As an example, Block cites what he says is a high percentage of workers who go on disability. \"Nearly 9 percent of covered employees go out on short term disability every year, with an average outage from work of almost 12 weeks each,\" he says on his campaign website. \"These are very high utilization rates, and would either indicate that Rhode Island has a very sick workforce or that the program has some systemic problems [that] need to be addressed.\" Whether the system is well-run or not is a matter of opinion. But we decided to see if his statement about how many workers go out on disability is accurate. We looked at some of this back in July, when we checked a claim by state Rep. Patricia Morgan that used Block\u2019s numbers to compare Rhode Island and New Jersey\u2019s TDI usage rates. Block\u2019s campaign said his source for the 9-percent figure is the 2011 annual report of the state Department of Labor and Training, which administers the temporary disability program. According to the department\u2019s website, Rhode Island\u2019s TDI system was the first in the nation. It collects taxes, 1.2 percent on the first $61,400 a worker earns, and uses that money to pay benefits to others who miss at least seven consecutive days of work because of a medical condition, certified by a doctor. TDI benefits aren\u2019t taxable. The DLT\u2019s annual report lists the number of eligible claims filed with the program each year, the net amount paid and the number of employees in the state who were supporting the program by paying TDI taxes. Block took the total number of 2011 eligible claims, 35,836, and divided it by the number of workers paying TDI taxes, 393,000, which produces a result of 9.1 percent. When we checked with the DLT, spokeswoman Nikki Armstrong said the number of claims represents how many requests for payment the program received. But that doesn\u2019t tell you how many people filed for TDI benefits, because individual employees sometimes make more than one claim in a year. The figure that does is the new claims number, which tells how many people made a first claim on the system in that year. In 2011, that number was 30,953, which was 7.9 percent of the 393,000 people paying into the system, not the \"nearly 9 percent\" Block cited. According to the agency\u2019s 2011 report, the average length of a claim was 11.2 weeks, Block\u2019s \"almost 12 weeks\" claim. But there are more recent numbers than those Block cited. For 2013, slight increases in the number of people paying into the system and slight decreases in the number of new claims dropped that year\u2019s new claims percentage to 7.4 percent, according to the Department of Labor and Training. The average duration of a claim in 2013 went up to 12.2 weeks. Block said his claim was a good-faith calculation based on the best-publicly available data that the Department of Labor and Training had released. The agency\u2019s online report made no distinction between number of claims and number of claimants, he said. \"When we use data to do policy research, we use the data that is made available directly by the appropriate state agency,\" he said. The first-claim number wasn\u2019t in the posted report, he said. Our ruling Ken Block said nearly 9 percent of eligible employees go out on temporary disability each year, for an average of 12 weeks. He fell short on the first part of the claim, which he based on 2011 numbers. As we reported in our item last July, 7.9 percent of covered employees went out on disability in 2011. In 2013, it was 7.4 percent. He was closer on the second part of his claim. In both 2011 and 2013, the average duration of a claim was close to 12 weeks. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "The Iran deal \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\"",
        "doc": "A prime attack Kevin Nicholson makes against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin concerns the Iran deal that President Donald Trump recently withdrew from. The deal, Nicholson declared, had \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\" Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are running in the August 2018 Republican primary for the right to challenge Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the November 2018 general election. The Delafield businessman made the statement on May 30, 2018, to conservative Green Bay radio talk show host John Muir. It is one he has made repeatedly. He mostly misses. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The backdrop About three weeks before Nicholson made the radio claim, Trump announced the United States would pull out of the nuclear pact with Iran and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, saying the deal failed to contain the regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions and regional meddling. The easy part of Nicholson\u2019s claim to check is Iran\u2019s connection to terrorism. Iran has been on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea) have been determined to have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\" But let\u2019s get to the thrust of Nicholson\u2019s claim -- that the deal merely \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes\" to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it. The cash The deal, struck in July 2015 under President Barack Obama, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future. So, it wasn\u2019t just merely turning over cash to Iran. Latest Kevin Nicholson fact checks: \"Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence.\" Mostly True. Says conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein is a Wisconsin resident. False. \"There are more guns in this country than there are people.\" Half True. As part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets \u2014 but the vast majority of those assets are Iran\u2019s own money. And what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions. As our PolitiFact colleagues have reported: The deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place. The total value \u2014 worldwide \u2014 of freed Iranian assets was about $56 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the U.S. State Department, Iran received about $1.7 billion from the United States \u2014 $400 million plus interest. The payment was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered. Many news organizations reported the delivery of the $400 million in an unmarked cargo plane after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran. As for Baldwin\u2019s backing of the Iran deal, she wasn\u2019t among the first. Her campaign cited reports showing that Baldwin announced her support on Aug. 7, 2015 \u2014 after 13 other senators had done so. Our rating Nicholson says the Iran deal \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\" Iran is on the United States\u2019 list of state sponsors of terrorism. As part of a 2015 deal aimed making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, Iran got access to tens of billions of dollars of its own assets that had been frozen \u2014 there weren\u2019t billions of dollars sent on a plane. The United States, in a transaction indirectly linked to the Iran deal, did send on a plane $400 million in cash to Iran. Iran was owed the money because it had paid the United States for military hardware in 1979 that was never delivered. Finally, Baldwin was not among the first senators to support the Iran nuclear deal. Thirteen other senators had announced their support before she did. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Nicholson a Mostly False.",

        "doc": "Donald Trump\u2019s border wall proposal has earned him high praise from his political predecessor, former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., according to a meme circulating on social media. According to one version of the meme, Bachmann said, \"There are those who say a border wall won't work. They just don't have the vision Donald Trump does. The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China.\" It\u2019s a tidy confluence of past and present presidential campaigns, as Trump\u2019s lead in the Republican field is often compared to Bachmann\u2019s early success in the 2012 presidential election. Several readers asked us to look into whether Bachmann actually made the comments. We obliged and found no evidence backing the claim. We also reached out to Bachmann\u2019s spokesperson, who said the former member of Congress never made the remarks. The first thing that had us raising our eyebrows was some of the text that accompanied the meme when it was posted on Facebook. \"What do you think about a Trump/Bachmann ticket in the 2016 Presidential race?\" it said. \"Former Rep. Michelle Bachman (sic) told Fox News' Jenna Jameson she \u2018admired Donald's leadership and vision\u2019 and also complimented Trump on his reality show success, \u2018If Donald can do for this country what he did for Arsenio Hall America will be great again.\u2019 \" Jameson is a former porn star, not a Fox News host, nor is she employed by the network in any way, said a Fox spokesperson. (Jameson did make a rocky appearance on a Fox entertainment program in 2013.) We also searched three comprehensive databases -- Nexis and CQ, which aggregate transcripts, and Critical Mention, which records video and closed captioning -- and found no record of Bachmann ever making those comments. To our knowledge, she hasn\u2019t appeared on Fox News since Trump announced his candidacy. She has commented on and praised Trump in several interviews on different networks, though she has never mentioned his wall proposal. Here\u2019s a rundown of her Trump-related remarks: \u2022 Aug. 6 on MSNBC\u2019s Hardball: When asked if Trump will make for a good candidate, Bachmann said, \"Well, that's what he\u2019ll have to prove on the stage\" at the first GOP debate. \u2022 Aug 8 on CNN Tonight: \"He\u2019s like the Rocky Balboa of politics. He\u2019s a winner. He\u2019s been winning all through his life.\" \u2022 Aug. 10 in an interview with conservative radio host Tony Perkins: \"When he talks about the effects of illegal immigration on the United States, that resonates with the American people.\" \u2022 Aug. 17 on CBS News: \"He\u2019s getting it right. \u2026 Donald Trump has the secret decoder ring of what\u2019s on voters\u2019 minds. I think I had that too when it came to the repeal of Obamacare. Donald Trump understands people are not happy with massive immigration from third-world countries.\" Before Trump, Bachmann championed the idea of a border fence for years, but we couldn\u2019t find an instance when she\u2019s evoked the Great Wall of China.ButTrump has. \"Well, 3,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China was built. We would like to have that wall. That wall, nobody gets through. That I can tell you. And that's 13,000 miles. right?\" he said at a town hall in New Hampshire on Aug. 18. \"I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they're going to call it the Trump Wall.\" Bachmann\u2019s spokeswoman told us that Bachmann agrees with Trump\u2019s views on immigration, adding, \"Trump's emphasis on stopping the current tidal wave of immigration is in sync with a plurality of voters, as polls demonstrate a great majority of Americans believe.\" Our ruling A meme says that Bachmann said, \"The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China.\" We found no evidence that Bachmann ever said this, and her spokeswoman said she did not, in fact, say it. The meme seems to have satirical origins but is now being passed off as fact.We rate the statement Pants on Fire!",

        "claim": "According to the Times in 1987, smallpox vaccines triggered the awakening of dormant HIV among recipients, causing the AIDS epidemic.",
        "doc": "In recent weeks, many accounts across various social media platforms have been resharing an old Times article claiming the AIDS epidemic was triggered by the smallpox vaccine. Although the article is real, there is no evidence for its claims. Published in May 1987, the article claimed the World Health Organisation (WHO) was studying whether the vaccine \"awakened\" dormant HIV. As evidence for the theory, it claimed that areas of central Africa with the greatest spread of HIV infection mirrored those with \"the most intense immunization programmes\". It also cited the case of an American soldier who developed AIDS shortly after being vaccinated against smallpox, and that needles used to vaccinate people against smallpox may have been reused, and sterilised ineffectively, potentially spreading HIV. There is no evidence that the smallpox vaccine was responsible for the AIDS epidemic. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in Contemporary criticism Historian of the AIDS epidemic Dr George Severs told Full Fact that when the theory was first posited in 1987 it may have received \"some cultural currency\", but its spread was largely limited due in part to the quick response of the scientific community. \"It's literally the next day people like the WHO and very high profile international scientists are coming out to say there's absolutely no truth in this theory whatsoever,\" he said. For example, days after the Times article was published, the New Scientist reported: \"The WHO denied that any of its advisors had made a statement to this effect.\" It quoted the director of the WHO's special programme on AIDS at the time, Jonathan Mann, who noted that the smallpox vaccine had been distributed across many areas of the world over the prior two centuries (after being discovered by Edward Jenner in 1796 ), and never linked to any upsurges in other diseases. He also disputed the claim that AIDS outbreaks were located in areas with recent smallpox vaccination efforts, saying: \"In Asia, where hundreds of millions of smallpox vaccinations were given from 1967 to 1972, AIDS remains rare. Conversely, the US is experiencing a major AIDS epidemic. Yet smallpox was eradicated there many years ago.\" The article did acknowledge a case of a US soldier who was reported to have developed AIDS shortly after receiving several immunisations, including a smallpox vaccination, noting: \"It is well known that a challenge to the immune system can sometimes cause someone who is infected by human immunodeficiency virus to develop full-blown AIDS\". However, an article in the Irish Independent reported on an editorial accompanying observations of this case, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which said the link \"may well be co-incidental because no other cases of this kind have been found\". It argued that even if AIDS in this individual was triggered by the smallpox vaccine, the event would be so rare it could not account for the AIDS epidemic in Africa. Recent research More recent research also dismisses the link between the smallpox vaccine and the AIDS epidemic. A study published in 2018 identified HIV-positive people in Senegal who had received the smallpox vaccine (indicated by the presence of the smallpox vaccine scar), to examine the relationship between smallpox vaccination and progression of HIV, indicated by levels of beta-2-microglobulin in the blood (a biomarker for HIV disease progression). The study said it did \"not find any association between the presence of smallpox vaccine scar and the [beta-2-microglobulin] level and does not support any association between a previous smallpox vaccination and HIV disease progression.\" There have been studies showing that smallpox vaccination may have had an inadvertent protective effect against HIV and its progression, though the data is far from certain and other studies have found no association. While the Times article focused on the theory that the smallpox vaccine could trigger HIV progression, some recent posts on social media sharing the story suggest that smallpox vaccines were contaminated with the HIV virus. (The posts actually claim the vaccine was \"laced with AIDS\", a collection of illnesses and infections which can be caused by the HIV virus ). These posts sometimes share a blurred copy of the Times's front page from 11 May 1987, failing to make it clear that the Times never suggested this was the case. There is no evidence that smallpox vaccines were deliberately contaminated with HIV, though some research has suggested the medical re-use of contaminated needles may account for some of the HIV spread seen in sub-Saharan Africa. An old story for new purposes The article appears to be shared in support of misinformation claiming that Covid-19 vaccines themselves are triggering a wide range of unreported side effects which are being ignored. These include heart attacks and recent cases of monkeypox, which some falsely suggest are actually cases of shingles triggered by the Covid-19 vaccines . Some of these alleged side effects are sometimes bundled together and termed \" VAIDS \", an abbreviation of \"vaccine AIDS\", so there is a parallel to claims the smallpox vaccines caused AIDS in the 1980's. There are of course rare serious side effects which can be caused by the Covid-19 vaccines. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has, for example, identified a \"likely\" link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and fatal blood clotting. It has also identified a possible link between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and heart inflammation. To the end of April 2022, 33 deaths in England and Wales have been registered with vaccine side effects on the death certificate, though some deaths which were caused by vaccines may not have yet been registered. For example, the MHRA acknowledges 81 people have died of blood clots with low platelet counts following an AstraZeneca vaccine. But there is no evidence the vaccines are causing widespread autoimmune disease, causing the widespread progression of existing autoimmune disorders, or contributing to significant loss of life, as was seen during the AIDS epidemic . In November, a study from the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and  European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 470,000 lives had been saved by the vaccine in people aged 60 and over across 33 countries in Europe since the start of the vaccine roll out. In England alone , it estimated that 157,000 deaths had been averted. The Times' article, when shared with claims smallpox vaccines were deliberately \" laced with AIDS \", also ties into conspiracy theories that global organisations and high-profile individuals are acting to depopulate the world, by deliberately killing millions of people, a claim we've written about a number of times . These false claims have been linked to the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines . There is no evidence for these theories. Image courtesy of NIAID",

        "doc": "The $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan advocated by President Joe Biden promises funding for a host of improvements aimed at shoring up the nation\u2019s bridges, water pipes, roads and more. Major investments in the bipartisan package include $110 billion for roads and bridges, $39 billion for public transit and $66 billion for railways. In a June 29, 2021 visit to La Crosse, Biden noted his visit fell on the 65th anniversary of President Dwight Eisenhower signing a bill that created the country's interstate highway system \u2014 the last infrastructure bill of the scope being considered. \"It's time for us to write a new chapter in that story,\" Biden said. On Aug. 10, 2021, the Senate voted 69-30 to approve an infrastructure plan crafted by a bipartisan group of senators. It is now awaiting action in the House. Prior to the vote, in a July 5, 2021 interview on WISN\u2019s \"UpFront,\" Wisconsin\u2019s Secretary of Transportation-designee Craig Thompson urged support for the measure. \"If we get more federal money, I think people will see simply the condition of the roads, both at the state and local levels, improve,\" Thompson said, arguing that under Gov. Tony Evers the state had slowed a trend of \"disinvestment and neglect\" of Wisconsin's roads. \"I believe we have stopped the decline in the condition of our state highways,\" Thompson said. \"We've gotten more money to the locals. But we\u2019ve got 115,000 miles of roads in this state and 90% is owned by the locals. They just have a lot of roadway and they\u2019ve got a long way to go.\" That\u2019s a lot of miles. Is Thompson accurate on the breakdown? Joel Nilsestuen, assistant deputy secretary at the Department of Transportation, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a document \"Six Year Highway Improvement Program: 2021-2026.\" It included this note: Wisconsin has 115,674 miles of public roads, from Interstate freeways to city and village streets. This highway improvement program covers only the 11,745-mile state highway system which is administered and maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). The other 103,929 miles are improved and maintained by the cities, towns, counties and villages in which they are located. A side note: That measurement is of \"centerline miles,\" of the length of the roadways, not lane miles which take into account multiple lanes. By that measure, Dane County comes out on top, with 4,260.44, followed by Marathon County (3,389.19), Waukesha County (3,120.90) then Milwaukee County (3,047.94) and Marinette County (2,363.06). Curt Witynski, deputy executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, said the group supports the infrastructure plan and that he expects local governments to benefit from the measure through \"Funding for improving our transportation infrastructure, including bridges and streets, but also alternative transportation options, like bike paths and lanes. Also, we anticipate benefits to our municipal bus systems.\" It is too early to say how much Wisconsin could be allocated from the new federal infrastructure measure, or what percentage will go to the state vs. local units of government. But that was not part of the claim. Thompson said \"we\u2019ve got 115,000 miles of roads in this state and 90% is owned by the locals.\" Wisconsin has 115,674 miles of public roads and maintains the 11,745-mile state highway system. The other 103,929 miles are maintained by local municipalities, or 89.846%. For a statement that is accurate and not missing anything significant, our rating is True.",

        "claim": "If it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is \"going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet.\"",
        "doc": "On a recent episode of his HBO talk show, comedian Bill Maher said it was outrageous how much the Border Patrol is poised to expand due to an amendment to the Senate immigration bill. Maher was referring to an amendment sponsored by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee that would add \"19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border.\" The amendment was widely seen as as a way of garnering votes from undecided Republicans. (The amendment, and eventually the bill itself, passed the Senate easily with bipartisan support, though the measure now faces an uncertain fate in the House.) If the bill is enacted as is, Maher said during a roundtable segment of his June 21, 2013, show, it is \"going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet. There'll be over 40,000 agents. It's four times more than any of the Republicans were asking for in their wildest dreams. It's like, to get Republican senators to vote for something now, you have to get to crazy.\" A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The bill is \"going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI\" The amendment promises 19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. In most media accounts, this has been shorthanded to be roughly a doubling of the size of the southwest border agent ranks to 40,000. The most recent published statistics we found reported that in 2012, there were 18,516 Border Patrol agents on the southwest border. That would make the new total 37,716 once the newcomers are all sworn in and wearing uniforms. That\u2019s not quite 40,000, but even at 37,716, it\u2019s still enough to beat the FBI, because in 2012, the FBI had 35,629 employees. Want an even more striking comparison? Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies. The FBI has 13,766 special agents. This means that once the amendment\u2019s plan is carried out, the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world. (And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that. It assigned an additional 2,430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions, and its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has nearly 39,000 additional employees in the U.S. and around the world.) So, however you slice it, Maher\u2019s correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted. \"You could put one (Border Patrol) agent every 250 feet\" According to the International Water and Boundary Commission -- a bi-national body that oversees governance issues on the U.S.-Mexico border -- the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1,954 miles long. That works out to 10.32 million feet. Doing the math, you could space out 37,716 agents one every 274 feet (or, using the widely published 40,000 figure, you could put them every 258 feet). Either way, Maher\u2019s calculation strikes us as very close to accurate. Needless to say, the Border Patrol wouldn\u2019t deploy their personnel in this fashion. Not only do patrols work on shifts, but some agents are flying helicopters, some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder-to-shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars, searching for drugs. But Maher\u2019s rhetorical point is well-taken: The agency literally, if it wished, could place agents every 274 feet. Our ruling Maher said that if it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is \"going to make the border patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet.\" He\u2019s right on the first claim and on target with the second. In all, we rate his statement True.",

        "claim": "Arturo Tolentino was the duly elected vice president in 1986 and was the real president after Ferdinand Marcos flew to Hawaii.",
        "doc": "Netizens have revived a two-year-old Facebook (FB) post saying the presidency of Corazon Aquino was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d This is false. It also claimed that senator Arturo Tolentino was the \u201cduly elected vice president\u201d in the 1986 snap elections, and was the \u201creal president\u201d after his running mate, former President Marcos, fled to Hawaii. This is misleading. In May 1986, or three months after Marcos\u2019 20-year rule was put to an end by the Feb. 22-25 People Power Revolution, the Supreme Court (SC) dismissed three petitions that challenged the legitimacy of Aquino\u2019s presidency. The High Court referred to the Aquino administration as \u201ca de jure government\u201d \u2014 meaning it was in accordance with the law \u2014 and said it was the people who \u201chave made the judgment\u201d and \u201caccepted\u201d Aquino as their president. The SC reiterated this five months later, in an Oct. 24, 1986 decision on a petition that sought a clarification on the \u201cPresident and Vice-President\u201d referred to in the transitory provisions under the then-draft of a new Constitution: whether they were Aquino and her vice president Salvador Laurel, or Marcos and Tolentino. The SC magistrates said it was \u201ca matter of public record and common public knowledge\u201d that Aquino and Laurel were the \u201cincumbent and legitimate\u201d president and vice president that time. Both Aquino and Laurel, and Marcos and Tolentino, were sworn into office on Feb. 25, 1986, after a snap election that historical accounts published by The Official Gazette and the Malaca\u00f1ang described as marred with \u201cmassive poll fraud and rampant cheating.\u201d Marcos\u2019 proclamation of his victory a few days earlier was met with indignation by Aquino supporters. Later, key military officials broke away from their commander-in-chief, leading to the historic EDSA Revolution, where millions of Filipinos peacefully protested and called for Marcos\u2019 ouster. The misleading FB post, first published by an FB user in February 2019, featured a screenshot of another FB post that shared a report by website socialmediaph-ph.blogspot.com titled, \u201cLook: Si Arturo Tolentino at HINDI si Cory Aquino ang Dapat naging Presidente ng Pilipinas 1986 \u2013 1992 (Arturo Tolentino and not Cory Aquino should have been the President of the Philippines from 1986 to 1992).\u201d It has received over 6,100 reactions, 1,200 comments, and 51,000 shares from FB users. It has been re-shared since 2019, but it got an uptick in engagements during the first week of this month, a few days after the 35th anniversary of the People Power Revolution last Feb. 25. At least ten netizens also reposted the screenshot of the misleading report from March 2 to March 17, with one sharing it in public FB group PROTECT THE PRESIDENT DUTERTE. A similar claim circulated on social media as early as November 2018, and was flagged as partly false by Agence France-Presse.

        "doc": "A vague attack on \"the Bidens\" claims they own 10% of the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., and that the company\u2019s stock \"has soared almost 300%\" since Joe Biden was elected. CATL is known as China\u2019s top battery maker and counts electric vehicle maker Tesla among its customers. It has been a hot stock as more automakers shift their attention to electric vehicles. A 10% stake would be worth about $18 billion. The attack, shared in a Facebook post, continues with a conspiracy theory alleging that the Bidens will profit because China has been in talks with the Taliban and will \"take over\" Afghanistan\u2019s market for lithium, which is used in electric vehicle batteries. Biden in August issued an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence for either part of the claim. No Bidens among largest shareholders: Three individuals own 10% or more of CATL, according to MarketScreener.com, a stock market and financial news website. They are the company\u2019s chairman, Yu Qun Zeng; its vice chairman, Shi Lin Huang; and Chinese billionaire Zhen Hua Pei. No individual stocks owned by Joe, Jill Biden: Since becoming president, Biden has filed one financial disclosure form for himself and his wife, Jill, on May 17, 2021. Previously, Biden filed a disclosure as a presidential candidate, on May 20, 2020. The forms show that the couple\u2019s investments did not include any individual stocks. Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter has been scrutinized for his financial ties to China, but no reports have emerged that he has a large direct stake in CATL. The Wall Street Journal reported in December 2020 that Hunter Biden had a 10% stake in the private-equity firm Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. BHR, founded by a Chinese businessman, invested in CATL and profited from it, but Biden\u2019s lawyer said Biden made no return on his own investment, according to the article. Stock up 90%, not 300%: CATL shares trade on China\u2019s Shenzhen stock exchange. The closing prices for CATL stock were 256.02 yuan (or about $40) on Nov. 3, 2020, the day of the presidential election; 266.43 yuan on Nov. 9, the first market day after he was declared the winner; and 486.50 yuan on Sept. 3, 2021, the last market day before the image was posted on Facebook. From Nov. 3, 2020, to Sept. 3, 2021, the price increased 90%. In 2020, the year before Biden took office, the stock price tripled. We rate the claim False.",

        "claim": "Wearing a mask reduces oxygen up to 60%",
        "doc": "The posts, shared thousands of times in the US and Canada since May 2020, list a number of risk associated with mask wearing including: \u201creduces oxygen up to 60%,\u201d \u201cincreases risk of CO2 poisoning,\u201d and \u201ccauses increased face-touching.\u201d Similar claims have also been posted in Spanish. Vinita Dubey, Associate Medical Officer of Health at Toronto Public Health, told AFP via email that, if worn correctly, a cloth mask is unlikely to reduce oxygen enough that the wearer would pass out. \u201cIn general, a cloth mask does not fit tightly to the face. Air can still go around the mask as well as through the pores in the material,\u201d while acting as a barrier to small virus particles, she said. The claim that masks cause an oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) was disproved in a separate AFP fact-check. The claim that wearing a mask \u201cincreases risk of CO2 poisoning\u201d was also refuted by Dubey. \u201cProlonged use of a face mask, including the N95, has not been shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity in healthy people. If CO2 slowly builds up in the mask over time, the levels are low and mostly tolerable,\u201d Dubey said. N95 masks used by health care workers are designed to have a very tight fitting. However, there can be specific circumstances where \u201csome individuals may not be comfortable wearing a mask. Anxiety or panic may lead to hyperventilation (rapid breathing) which can cause the CO2 levels to drop and symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and confusion,\u201d Dubey added. The post also claims that wearing a mask \u201cincreases face touching.\u201d Hyo-Jick Choi, Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s Chemical and Materials Engineering Department, said he is not aware of any study that directly correlates wearing a mask with increased face touching. Choi told AFP via email that \u201cwhether you wear a mask or not, face touching can either infect an individual by the contaminated hands, or transmit disease by the contaminated masks and cause infections.\u201d Both Choi and Dubey were clear that users should not touch their masks after putting them on. Dubey stressed that \u201ca mask should fit comfortably and be easy to breathe to avoid frequent adjustments of the mask while using it.\u201d The post also claims that \u201cviruses and bacteria saturate the outside\u201d of the mask. Choi said, \u201cit depends on the risk level of the environments, the time spent and where the mask has been exposed to.\u201d Health Canada guidelines state that \u201cif you plan to reuse the mask, wash it before wearing it again.\u201d Finally, the post claims that \u201ccontaminants sit within mask fibers, get reinhaled.\u201d This is misleading. Choi explained that \u201crespiratory diseases are transmitted by virus/bacteria-carrying droplets. Face masks are used to prevent the transmission of those pathogens-carrying droplets (i.e. contaminants),\u201d and it is unlikely that these would be \u201creinhaled\u201d as claimed in the post. \u201cIf the pathogen-carrying droplets (from large droplets to small aerosols) are produced by human activities such as sneezing, coughing, and speaking, then the virus-carrying droplets would have a composition similar to saliva. In this case, pathogens on the mask surface may not be easily released from fibers because of the high viscosity of the contaminant.\u201d Health Canada cautions, however, that homemade masks \u201cmay not provide complete protection against virus-sized particles.\u201d However, the agency, along with the CDC, continues to recommend that face masks or face coverings be used in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain.",

In a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote: \u201cTrump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed.

(@stonecold2050) September 22, 2019 That tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others. @Howroute also alluded to Trump\u2019s September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \u201cTrump\u2019s fancy border fence\u2026\u201d while another user joined in, adding \u201cBut \u2026 he said that you could \u2018fry an egg.'\u201d But but but\u2026.he said that you could \u201cfry an egg\u201d LOL!!!https://t.co/m4xDJUfz3x \u2014 Douglas Ritz (@douglasritz) September 19, 2019 Yet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \u201cThis wall can\u2019t be climbed,\u201d next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence: \u201cThis wall can\u2019t be climbed.\u201d -Donald Trump ??? -everyone else pic.twitter.com/YeP6M5qeOb \u2014 ElElegante101 (@skolanach) September 19, 2019 In reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump\u2019s claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump\u2019s election as president. Trump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure\u2019s resistance, the administration had invited 20 \u201cworld-class mountain-climbers\u201d to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \u201cThis was the one that was hardest to climb,\u201d Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they\u2019re unbelievable climbers. This wall can\u2019t be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it\u2019s also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it\u2019s designed to absorb heat. So it\u2019s extremely hot. The wall is \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It\u2019s very, very hot. So if they\u2019re going to climb it, they\u2019re going to have to bring hoses and water and we don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to hook it up because there\u2019s not a lot of water out here. So it\u2019s a very, very hard thing to climb.\u201d \ufeff Significant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump\u2019s claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \u201cworld-class mountain-climbers\u201d testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification. Notwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place. By contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president\u2019s claim that \u201cthis wall can\u2019t be climbed\u201d were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump\u2019s long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019. The video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below: \ufeff Trump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. \u2026 This wall can\u2019t be climbed.\u201d So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump\u2019s claims. The two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does) \u2014 a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side. The graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \u201ccan\u2019t be climbed,\u201d in September 2019: In a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president\u2019s assertions, \u201cMexicans have turned Trump\u2019s wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\u201d Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump\u2019s wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds pic.twitter.com/2Xr4rolKk2 \u2014 Stone ? (@stonecold2050) September 22, 2019 However, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \u201cvery, very hard thing to climb.\u201d Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018: Stunning Images Show Migrant Caravan Members Atop Border Fence https://t.co/g6xAP5H4JS \u2014 Natasha Fatah (@NatashaFatah) November 14, 2018 The San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below: Overall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump\u2019s boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019. Posts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

Juli schreibt: \u201eDie beobachteten geografischen Unterschiede der Meldeinzidenzen k\u00f6nnen m\u00f6glicherweise neben einem unterschiedlichen Test- und Impfverhalten auch durch den regional unterschiedlichen Verlauf vorangegangener Infektionswellen erkl\u00e4rt werden.\u201c/n/nLetzteres zeigt sich mit Blick auf die Infektionszahlen seit Beginn der Corona-Pandemie, schreibt die Pressestelle des RKI auf Anfrage von CORRECTIV.Faktencheck: \u201eWie im Archiv der Situationsberichte zu sehen, hatten die Bundesl\u00e4nder mit den niedrigsten Impfquoten wochen- und monatelang mit die h\u00f6chsten Inzidenzen.\u201c Das war zum Beispiel am30. November 2021in Sachsen und Th\u00fcringen der Fall.Als geimpft galten zu diesem Zeitpunkt alle Menschen, die eine Zweitimpfung oder eine Einmal-Impfung mit dem Johnson & Johnson-Impfstoff erhalten hatten. Dagegen hatte Schleswig-Holstein an diesem Tag eine der h\u00f6chstenImpfquotenund die niedrigste 7-Tage-Inzidenz aller Bundesl\u00e4nder./n/nDas war auch wenige Tage nach dem Erscheinen des Videos zu beobachten, wie aus dem Wochenbericht (S. 7) des RKI vom 21. Juli hervorgeht. So hatte Schleswig-Holstein einen deutlichen R\u00fcckgang bei der Zahl der Infektionen zu verzeichnen (minus 24 Prozent), wohingegen in Sachsen (plus 16 Prozent) und Th\u00fcringen (plus 24 Prozent) die Zahl der Infektionen deutlich stieg, obwohl die Impfquoten nahezu gleich blieben./n/nCovid-19-Impfstoffe sch\u00fctzen wirksam vor Infektion und schwerem Krankheitsverlauf/n/nAm Ende des Videos z\u00e4hlt der Sprecher drei M\u00f6glichkeiten auf, die angeblich erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnen, warum eine hohe Impfquote und eine hohe 7-Tage-Inzidenz gleichzeitig auftreten k\u00f6nnen \u2013 Belege nennt er daf\u00fcr jeweils nicht. Die erste M\u00f6glichkeit sei, dass Inzidenzen in Ostdeutschland so niedrig waren, weil dort weniger Menschen getestet werden. Es k\u00f6nne aber auch sein, dassdie Impfung nicht \u201edie versprochene Wirkung\u201c entfalte und die nat\u00fcrliche Immunit\u00e4t von Nicht-Geimpften ausreichend stark sei oder Geimpfte \u201eleichter ansteckbar\u201c seien./n/nWie wir bereits in mehreren Faktenchecks im Jahr 2021 berichteten, kann der Anstieg von Corona-Infektionszahlen durch unterschiedliche Faktoren beeinflusst werden, wie zum Beispiel durch dieZahl der durchgef\u00fchrten Corona-Testsoder denAnteil von geimpften Personenan der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung./n/nFakt ist: Menschenk\u00f6nnen beim Kontakt mit neuen Viren wie SARS-CoV-2 trotz eines funktionierenden Immunsystems krank werden. Eine Impfung trainiert das Immunsystem vorab, damit das m\u00f6glichst nicht passiert. Dar\u00fcber berichteten wir ausf\u00fchrlich in einemFaktencheckim November 2021./n/nDie Corona-Impfstoffe sch\u00fctzen zwar nicht immer vor einer Infektion, doch sie sch\u00fctzen gut vor einem schweren oder t\u00f6dlichen Krankheitsverlauf, wie wir zuletztam 25. Juli berichteten.Gegen eine Infektion mit der Delta-Variante zeigen die Covid-19-Impfstoffe von Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna und Astrazeneca eine Wirksamkeit von etwa 75 Prozent und gegen eine schwere Covid-19-Erkrankung von etwa 90 Prozent, wie das RKIauf seiner Website angibt(Stand: 7. Juni 2022). Vor einer Infektion mit der Omikron-Variante, die aktuell in Deutschland vorherrschend ist (PDF-Download), bieten die Impfstoffe einen geringeren Schutz als vor der Delta-Variante \u2013 auch dar\u00fcber informiert das RKI auf seiner Internetseite. Was ein geringerer Schutz konkret bedeutet, l\u00e4sst sich momentan nicht sagen, da bislang noch nicht ausreichend Daten vorhanden sind./n/nFazit:Die im Video genannten Zahlen belegen keinen Zusammenhang zwischen der 7-Tage-Inzidenz und der Impfquote. Steigt die 7-Tage-Inzidenz trotz hoher Impfquote, hei\u00dft das erstmal nur, dass sich mehr Menschen infizieren \u2013 die Begr\u00fcndung daf\u00fcr l\u00e4sst sich aus den Daten nicht ablesen./n/nRedigatur: Matthias Bau, Sarah Thust/n/nUpdate, 5.

The incident took place on the night of April 16 when three men were attacked by a mob of local tribals near Gadchinchale village. They were reportedly on their way from Mumbai\u2019s Kandivili to Silvassa to attend a funeral when they were stopped by a vigilante group that was set up by locals to patrol during the night. The mob questioned these men who were travelling in a van. They pelted stones at them and later beat them up with sticks. The police have detained over 100 people and nine minors in connection with the lynching. Alt News reached out to PRO of Palghar police who reiterated that there is no communal angle to the incident. We were informed that both the accused and victim are from the same faith. The accused belong to the tribal community. The PRO said, \u201cThere was a rumour circulating in the area and the police had also issued a message regarding it.\u201d There were reportedly rumours about migrants robbing the tribals village in Palghar district. Palghar SP Gaurav Singh informed The Indian Express that the investigation into the incident has so far focused on identifying the sources of the rumours spread in the tribal village. Moreover, according to the 2011 census data of the Gadchinchale village of the Dahanu Taluka, it has over 248 households and of which majority of them belong to the scheduled tribe. Days before the incident, four police personnel were left injured in an incident where the SUV of a skin specialist Dr Vishwas Walwi of Thane was destroyed at Saarni village by a mob. \u201cAt least 250 people had attacked them when Dr Walwi was returning home after distributing food grains and conducting a small door-to-door thermal screening of tribals,\u201d said a report Hindustan Times published on April 17, 2020. Prominent social media users like Suresh Chavhanke and Ashoke Pandit attempted to give the incident a communal colour by claiming that the men involved in the lynching were members of the Muslim community. The accused and victims both hail from the same religion. There is no communal angle to the incident. Donate to Alt News!

In a commemorative speech on Sept. 11, 2023, the 22nd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in which thousands of people died, U.S. President Joe Biden said he remembered standing at ground zero in New York City the next day and looking at the rubble of the fallen World Trade Center: I join you on this solemn day to renew our sacred vow: never forget; never forget; we never forget. Each of us ... each of those precious lives stolen too soon when evil attacked. Ground zero, New York. I remember standing there the next day and looking at the building. I felt like I was looking through the gates of hell, it looked so devastated. As a great many social media users were quick to point out, however, there is no evidence Biden visited ground zero on Sept. 12, 2001, and plenty of evidence to the contrary.

Not only was he in attendance at a Senate session, but as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee managed the discussion prior to a vote that would unanimously confirm a joint resolution condemning the 9/11 attacks. This in confirmed in contemporaneous news coverage. As The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, reported the following day: Just as he had hoped and demanded, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden spent Wednesday [Sept. 12] exactly where he wanted: in the U.S. Senate. Biden was one of the first and most vociferous in demanding that Congress return to action to prove the government is functioning. Terrorists win, he said only hours after Tuesday's attack, when the government goes into hiding. Biden would not visit ground zero for the first time until a week later, on Sept. 20, 2001, when, according to The Associated Press, he joined a delegation of senators who traveled by train from Washington to New York to see the devastation with their own eyes. Snopes reached out to the White House for comment on Biden's apparent misremembrance of the date. This article will be updated if we receive new information. ",

In 2017, Master Gims has sold more than 5 million albums since the beginning of his career6. Users on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they might have mistaken it for real news: However, chanteur-news-fr.info was involved with a viral death hoax before only a few days ago, we reported on that here: You'll notice the exact same cause of death and the style of the article was identical too: most of it was taken up by a biography copy-pasted from elsewhere. And the photo that went with the story seems to have been taken from a story in the Romanian media about an accident there: Trafic blocat pe E 85, \u00een jude\u021bul Vrancea, \u00een urma unui accident grav Accident deosebit de grav pe E 85, \u00een jude\u021bul Vrancea, \u00een localitatea Haret.

Inspectoratul pentru Situa\u021bii de Urgen\u021b\u0103 a declan\u0219at planul ro\u0219u de interven\u021bie. That would explain why the firemen in the picture have the Romanian word \"Pompieri\" on their uniforms instead of \"Pompiers\" which one would expect in Paris, France. No other news outlets reported on the news, and the site itself seems to have been registered in Russia about two months ago. Don't fall for this hoax!",

        "doc": "South Africa\u2019s police minister has accused South African Airways (SAA), the country\u2019s national airline, of being guilty of a \u201cdespicable crime against black business\u201d.Calling it \u201cwhite monopoly existence in full colour\u201d, Fikile Mbalula tweeted that \u201c98% of SAA\u2019s R24 billion procurement goes to white-owned companies while black-owned get 2%\u201d.Several Africa Check readers asked us to investigate.Minister responded on TwitterAppropriately, Africa Check managed to get comment from the minister via Twitter.Mbalula said the source of his information was an October 2016news articlewhich said 2% of procurement was to black-owned firms.The article quoted SAA chairman Duduzile Myeni as saying \u201cwe need to find smart ways to ensure that we move from 2% of the procurement spend on historically disadvantaged groups\u201d.R14.9 billion spent locallyThe most recent available information shows that SAA\u2019s 2015/16operating costswere R30 billion.SAA\u2019s spokesman, Tlali Tlali, said theairline\u2019s recordsshowed its total spend on local procurement for 2015/16 was R14.9 billion. Local spend is required to meet the requirements of South Africa\u2019sBroad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Actandcodes.The South African government\u2019s policy of broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) aims toincrease participationin the country\u2019s economy.Anumber of targetshave been set to increase the participation of black people in theownership and management structuresof enterprises.Enterprises doing business with government or an organ of state are required to be compliant and verify their level of transformation.Claim \u201cblack-owned [companies] get 2%\u201d... \u201cof SAA\u2019s...procurement\" Verdict mostly-correctOf the R14.9 billion spent locally, R14.2 billion was spent on B-BBEE compliant companies. \u201cThis represented 95% of local spend,\u201d Tlali said.However, not all B-BBEE compliant companies are \u201cblack-owned\u201d, as defined in the B-BBEE Act.The act\u2019s definition of\u201cblack\u201dincludes African, Coloured and Indian people. Companies with \u201cover 50% black voting rights are considered to be.Tlali told Africa Check that R252 million of SAA\u2019s total local procurement was spent on companies that met the black ownership requirement.This works out to 1.7% of the company's total eligible spend of R14.9 billion, close to Mbalula\u2019s figure of 2%. The airlinefell short of its targetof 8% for the year.Entry barriers into aviation are highBarriers to entry in aviation are high,SAA notes in its financial report.Thus, increasing black-owned procurement may not be an easy exercise, according to Dirk de Vos, chief executive officer of corporate finance and advisory firm QED Solutions\u201cIt might be possible for SAA to contract some of its indirect black suppliers directly, [but] this may be difficult logistically or on a supply chain management basis,\u201d said De Vos.He said that while Mbalula\u2019s claim of black-owned companies getting 2% of local procurement was correct it was misleading.\u201cIf B-BBEE compliance cannot be the measure, then the whole B-BBEE edifice is effectively treated as a non-existent factor,\u201d De Vos said.He said SAA\u2019s 95% B-BBEE compliance figure was a \u201csignificant achievement\u201d.Claim \u201c98% of SAA\u2019s...procurement goes to white-owned companies\" Verdict incorrectThis part of Mbalula\u2019s claim is incorrect.\u201cIt is wrong to say 98% went to white-owned companies,\u201dYuneal Padayachy, deputy director of B-BBEE procurement, transformation and verification at the department of trade and industry, told Africa Check.\u201cA portion of that would have gone to state-owned enterprises.\u201dUnlike private companies, state-owned enterprises are measured against a specialised B-BBEE scorecard which excludes the assessment of ownership, Padayachy explained\u201cThey are not white, black or Indian-owned,\u201d said Padayachy, \u201cThey are owned by government.\u201dFor example, theAirports Company South Africawould have accounted for \u201ca significant amount\u201d of SAA\u2019s costs,Israel Noko, founder and CEO of B-BBEE advisory firmNPI Governance Consulting, told Africa Check.A2016/17 cash flow projectionfrom SAA shows that it expects to spend R1.5 billion with the Airports Company South Africa.Nearly 75%of the company is owned by the South African government.R4.1 billion to state-owned enterprisesSAA\u2019s Tlali told Africa Check that in 2015/16 the company spent R4.1 billion on state-owned enterprises. This would have accounted for 27.5% of their R14.9 billion local procurement.Africa Check sent questions to Tlali to verify the share but he declined to comment. Questions sent to the airline\u2019s acting chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chairman went unanswered.So did the remaining balance (70.8%) go to companies that had less than 50% black ownership? We asked SAA but they wouldn\u2019t say.\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible but very difficult to get that level of information,\u201d Padayachy told Africa Check.\u201cThe only way to get that information would be to speak to [SAA\u2019s B-BBEE] verification agency or get it from SAA.\u201dWithout this information from SAA, it is impossible to confirm exactly how much of their local procurement went to white-owned companies. However, it is not the 98% Mbalula claimed, as 27.5% was spent on other state-owned enterprises which are not considered white or black-owned.",

        "claim": "As of December 2019, Christianity Today was backed or funded by George Soros or was a \"front organization\" for the philanthropist.",
        "doc": "In December 2019, numerous readers asked us about the accuracy of claims that the evangelical magazine Christianity Today was either \u201cbacked\u201d or funded by the billionaire, liberal philanthropist George Soros. Those reports came in the aftermath of a Dec. 19 editorial by the publication\u2019s editor-in-chief Mark Galli, who called for U.S. President Donald Trump to be removed from office, whether by impeachment or by popular vote in the 2020 presidential election, and described Trump as \u201ca near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.\u201d Despite the fact that Christianity Today is a long-established Christian conservative publication, which similarly indicted Democratic President Bill Clinton\u2019s moral authority to govern in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Trump and some of his supporters quickly endeavored to discredit Christianity Today and portray it as an ideologically motivated, left-wing, or even corrupt, organization. In a tweet, the president denounced the publication as a \u201cfar-left magazine.\u201d On Dec. 20, the conservative Christian website Pulpit and Pen, which is part of the Baptist, Montana-based Polemics Ministry United, published an article with the headline \u201cRemember That \u2018Christianity Today\u2019 Is Backed by George Soros.\u201d The article reported that: Christianity Today called for the U.S. Senate to affirm the impeachment of the U.S. House against President Donald J. Trump. As you soak that in, we\u2019ll remind you that it\u2019s already been reported by this publication (and others) that Christianity Today is a Soros front organization. [Blogger Ed] Stetzer and Christianity Today posted an article promoting George Soros\u2019 immigration plan on November 7. In it, they said that \u201cevangelicals should help lead\u201d Soros\u2019 immigration plan. That immigration plan was planned and promoted by the Evangelical Immigration Table, which is a Soros front organization of the National Immigration Forum and is ultimately traced directly back to Soros\u2019 Open Societies Foundation. That Soros owns the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) is so well-known, it\u2019s not worth answering any ill-informed dispute of the knowledge. Well-known Christian leader, Eric Metaxas, got off the board and repudiated it when he found out that it was a Soros operation. Christianity Today is in \u201ccahoots\u201d with Soros in a verifiably documented way. It should come as no surprise they\u2019re calling for Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. On Dec. 22, the right-leaning website DC Dirty Laundry published a tweaked version of Pulpit and Pen\u2019s article, and claimed that Christianity Today was \u201cfunded by George Soros,\u201d writing: \u201cChristianity Today has now strongly endorsed the impeachment of President Trump and it\u2019s time to expose them as the false teachers they are \u2026 Do you realize that Christianity Today is partially funded by George Soros?\u201d Soros has long been the subject of a seemingly endless series of fevered, baseless conspiracy theories, often inspired or aligned with anti-semitic tropes, which portray him as a shadowy, sinister, and unaccountable figure who exerts disproportionate control over global affairs. His status as a hate figure among many right-leaning observers and consumers of baseless conspiracy theories means that merely associating a given person or group with Soros has become a method of choice for discrediting an opponent or rhetorical target. So it was in the case of Christianity Today and its detractors in December 2019. Neither the publication nor its parent organization, the non-profit Christianity Today International, have received funding or institutional backing from Soros; claims to the contrary were based on a ludicrous distortion of extremely tenuous \u201cconnections\u201d \u2014 an example of the kind of \u201cjoining the dots\u201d that fuels many ultimately baseless conspiracy theories. In response to our requests for comment, Tim Dalrymple, president and CEO of Christianity Today International, told Snopes that: \u201cChristianity Today covers 85 percent of its annual budget through earned revenue: mostly subscriptions, advertising, and product sales. Only 15 percent of our budget comes through gifts and grants. We have never received a donation from George Soros or the Open Society Foundation. Of the foundations who have given us support, we cannot find any connection to Soros or any of his funding entities.\u201d We examined the organization\u2019s three most recent tax returns, from 2018, 2017, and 2016. None of those forms, nor any of the accompanying documents, contained any reference or information indicating any association between Christianity Today International or its subsidiary publication Christianity Today, and Soros or any of his associated philanthropic organizations. The claim that Christianity Today is \u201cbacked\u201d or funded by Soros, or that it is a \u201cSoros front organization,\u201d is simply false. The link drawn by Pulpit and Pen consisted of the following, relatively convoluted connections: In November, the Evangelical Immigration Table, an initiative by Evangelical pastors that promotes and emphasizes the dignity and humanity of displaced migrants, launched a campaign called the Evangelical Call for Restitution-Based Immigration Reform. One of those who supported the campaign was Ed Stetzer, a pastor and Christianity Today columnist, who wrote in a tweet that the campaign \u201cpoints to a way forward on immigration that\u2019s guided by biblical principles.\u201d On Nov. 9, Christianity Today published a column by Matthew Soerens, national coordinator of the Evangelical Immigration Table, in which he explained and promoted the campaign. The Evangelical Immigration Table shares links with another organization called the National Immigration Forum. In 2013, for example, the forum provided funding for an Evangelical Immigration Table advertising campaign that promoted immigration reform and was targeted towards Christians. According to figures published by the right-leaning website Breitbart, the National Immigration Forum received just under $3.3 million in grant money from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation in 2009 and 2010. In 2013, the forum\u2019s Executive Director Ali Noorani acknowledged (without providing specific details) that it had received some Open Society Foundation funding, but said none of it was used to pay for the ad campaign. Because Christianity Today has not received funding from Soros or his Open Society Foundation, and because it is not a \u201cfront organization\u201d for the philanthropist, as Pulpit and Pen falsely claimed, those seeking to discredit the publication by associating it with Soros were forced to stretch and distort the existing facts at their disposal. Almost a decade ago, the National Immigration Forum received some funding from a Soros organization. A few years later, the forum paid for a pro-immigration reform advertising campaign by the Evangelical Immigration Table, but no funding from Soros was used in that particular endeavor. Six years later, in 2019, the Evangelical Immigration Table launched another campaign in favor of restitution-based, biblically founded immigration reform. Christianity Today hosted a column written by the Evangelical Immigration Table\u2019s national coordinator, and one of its columnists (Stetzer) publicly supported the campaign. It was on the basis of those facts that Pulpit and Pen, DC Dirty Laundry and others reached the factually insupportable conclusion that Christianity Today was \u201cbacked\u201d and funded by Soros. Neither was true.",

        "doc": "A post on Facebook has made a number of claims about cucumber's ability to kill cancer cells. This is mostly based on evidence that looks at one chemical present in cucumbers and its ability to kill cells in the lab and in mice, rather than any evidence showing that specifically eating cucumbers prevents cancer in humans. None of the scientific papers cited in the post show that eating cucumber can prevent or treat lung cancer. One study the author refers to looked at the effect of a chemical called cucurbitacin B (found in cucumbers , and other foods like pumpkins and gourds) on tumour cell growth in both cells in the lab and in mice. It found that cucurbitacin B on its own or in combination with a chemotherapy drug slowed the growth of tumour cells. But this doesn't prove that this chemical in isolation would be effective at treating lung cancer in humans, and definitely doesn't prove that eating cucumber has the same benefits. Since we published this article, the post's author has amended the caption accompanying the image with a correction clarifying that we don't know if cucumbers have any ability to prevent cancer in humans. The post also included a claim that research from India has shown that \"people eating cucumber every day had a remarkable 71% less risk for lung cancer.\" We were not able to find any papers that supported this claim. Fact checkers Science Feedback also wrote about this post, and following that, the post's author contacted them with details of a study he was referring to, and updated his post to include this link. As Science Feedback wrote, that study did not prove that eating cucumbers prevented lung cancer. It looked at the diets of several hundred people, including a group that ate certain types of green vegetables, including cucumber. It found that consuming these foods was associated with lower rates of lung cancer. The paper concludes that diet in general has a role in causing lung cancer, but the association is weak compared to the effect of smoking.",

        "claim": "\"In Washington, McCaskill joined the liberals for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants.\"",
        "doc": "Immigration policy is one of the thorniest issues of the 2018 midterm election cycle. Just ask incumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She\u2019s running against Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley in one of the nation\u2019s most high-profile races. An ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican-backed political action committee, questions her voting record on immigration. \"In Missouri, Claire McCaskill said she was against amnesty for illegal immigrants. In Washington, McCaskill joined the liberals for giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants without border protections in place,\" the ad said. We\u2019ve fact-checked some of the Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s other ads, as well as various politicians\u2019 statements pertaining to McCaskill\u2019s immigration voting record. We wanted to see if there was truth to the ad\u2019s claim that McCaskill voted along party lines to grant amnesty 11 million undocumented immigrants . The Senate Leadership Fund did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s request for comment or clarification. However, the ad included a small caption referencing McCaskill\u2019s voting record, noting McCaskill\u2019s vote in favor of the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act(S. 744). It would have provided some of the undocumented immigrants living in America a pathway to citizenship which would have taken at least 13 years. At the time, the so-called \"gang of eight,\" a coalition of four Republican and four Democratic senators, touted the bill as a sweeping fix for the country\u2019s flawed immigration system. The bill proposed the following steps to citizenship: The bill would have also allocated $46.3 billion in border security, doubled the number of border agents, imposed fines on immigrants seeking citizenship and created a merit-based visa category, among other measures. It passed the Senate 68-32, but died in the House. Although the bill would have laid out a path to citizenship, the experts we talked to said it was a stretch to call it amnesty as the Senate Leadership Fund did. \"I do think this is a type of amnesty,but I would hesitate before using amnesty in our current political environment because it has been so heavily criticized,\" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. \"Amnesty tends to indicate that you\u2019re talking about giving someone a benefit that they don\u2019t deserve,\" Pierce said. Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. \"The whole point of the Senate bill was to create a whole series of hurdles that people who were here without status would have to jump through, including background checks, paying significant fines, waiting long periods of times,\" he said. \"It was all linked to securing the border.\" Alden noted that critics of the 2013 bill might liken it to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The 1986 bill, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, gave the approximately 3 million unauthorized immigrants who had arrived in the country prior to Jan. 1, 1982, a chance to apply for citizenship. As a result of its passage, 2.7 million people obtained permanent residency status, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. \"(Senate bill 744) was also closely tied to meeting border security benchmarks, whereas the Immigration Reform and Control Act legalization had no strings attached,\" Alden said in an email. Unlike the bill McCaskill voted for five years ago, Alden said the Reagan-era law did not \"prevent people from coming illegally in the future or from working in the United States even if they didn\u2019t have status.\" \"To conflate this with the amnesty President Reagan signed is a misreading of what (the 2013 bill) contained,\" Alden said. As for the Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s claim that 11 million people would have benefitted from the bill\u2019s pathway to citizenship, experts agreed that\u2019s also a stretch. \"Not everyone would have been able to meet those requirements and pay those fees (to get citizenship),\" said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Voigt said the lengthy process combined with strict background check requirements would have prevented all from qualifying. In 2013, McCaskill voted for a bill that would have given undocumented immigrants living in the country a path, albeit a long one, to citizenship. The Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s claim that she joined \"the liberals\" in supporting a bill that would have given \"amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants\" is deceptive for three reasons: First, the bill was branded as a bipartisan solution to immigration reform and co-sponsored by four Republican and four Democratic senators. Second, the bill included numerous hurdles unauthorized immigrants would have had to overcome, including fines and background checks, before becoming eligible for full citizenship. Experts say it is a loose interpretation of blanket residency. Lastly, in 2013 there were approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, but given the exclusions and restrictions included in the 2013 bill, not all of them would have qualified to start the citizenship process under the Senate bill\u2019s guidelines. For those reasons we rate this claim Mostly False.",

Many of these claims have been fact-checked repeatedly, yet the president persists in using them. Here is a guide to 18 claims, in the order in which Trump made them. As is our practice with live events, we do not award Pinocchio rankings, which are reserved for complete columns. \u201cSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.\u201d Trump often inflates the number of jobs created under his presidency by counting Election Day, rather than when he took the oath of office. There have been about 1.8 million jobs created since January 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s the slowest gain in jobs since 2010, which indicates how well job growth was going before Trump took office. There were 184,000 manufacturing jobs created in the 11 months since Trump took the oath of office, compared with a loss of 16,000 in 2016, according to the BLS. This is a substantial one-year gain, but it\u2019s still more than 1 million manufacturing jobs below the level at the start of the Great Recession. Advertisement \u201cAfter years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\u201d Trump once again takes credit for something that began to happen before his presidency. Wages have been on an upward trend since 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and in fact their growth slowed during the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency. Looking closely at the data, it\u2019s possible to argue wages were stagnant from 2000 to 2014, but the median salary has been increasing steadily since then and actually declined in the fourth quarter of 2017, from $353 a week to $345 in inflation-adjusted dollars. The president used data he once critiqued to claim success in lowering African-American youth unemployment. (Video: Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) \u201cAfrican American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\u201d This is a flip-flop by Trump. During the 2016 campaign, Trump used to claim a Four-Pinocchio statistic that 58 percent of African American youths were unemployed. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for black youth at the time was 19.2 percent \u2014 about one-third of the rate used by Trump. Now that he\u2019s president, Trump appears all too happy to cite the unemployment rate for African Americans, bragging that it\u2019s the best since the turn of the century. Advertisement The African American unemployment rate has been on a relatively steady decline since it hit a peak of 16.8 percent in March 2010, during the Great Recession. The rate had already fallen to 7.7 percent when Trump took the oath of office \u2014 it is now 6.8 percent \u2014 so Trump taking credit for this is like a rooster thinking the sun came up because he crowed. Similarly, Hispanic American unemployment had also been trending lower before Trump\u2019s presidency. It hit a low of 4.8 percent in several months in 2017, as well as in one month in 2006. \u201cUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.\u201d If Trump had given this speech last week, his claim might have been accurate. The number of people who filed unemployment claims hit 216,000 for the week that ended Jan. 13, the lowest level since January 1973. But there are more recent data now for the week that ended Jan. 20. New jobless claims rose to 233,000, the lowest since December. So it\u2019s a six-week low, not a 45-year low. Advertisement \u201cThe stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans\u2019 401(k), retirement, pension and college savings accounts.\u201d Trump frequently brags about the rising stock market \u2014 he\u2019s done it about once every three days as president \u2014 even though during the 2016 campaign he had said it was \u201ca big fat bubble\u201d that was about to pop. Trump is correct that $8 trillion in wealth has been created since the election \u2014 or $6.9 trillion since he took the oath of office, according to the Wilshire 5000 Index of stocks. But much of that gain in wealth did not trickle down to most Americans. Only about 50 percent of Americans own stocks directly or through retirement funds, according to a Gallup survey. And most of the value in stocks is held by the top 10 percent. Moreover, the U.S. rise in 2017 was not unique. When looking at the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, it\u2019s clear U.S. stocks haven\u2019t rallied quite as robustly as their foreign equivalents. So it\u2019s hard for Trump to make the case that his stewardship is making that much of a difference if stocks are doing better in other developed countries. In fact, Trump even falls short in comparison to Barack Obama\u2019s first year. The S&P 500 gained about 33.3 percent from inauguration through Jan. 29 under Obama, compared with 25.5 percent under Trump. Bragging about the rise of the stock market could backfire on the president if there is a sudden downturn. Stocks fell more than 1 percent Tuesday, as rising bond yields are becoming competitive with stocks that pay big dividends and traders are looking for less risky places to put their money. According to Trump\u2019s metric, almost $360 billion worth of wealth in the stock market disappeared Tuesday. The president has a habit of exaggerating; this time his exaggeration is the size of his proposed tax cut. (Video: Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) \u201cJust as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.\u201d Trump repeatedly claims he passed the biggest tax cut in U.S. history, but it\u2019s just not true. He\u2019s earned Four Pinocchios for this claim before \u2014 but repeated it 57 times in his first year as president. Advertisement The best way to compare tax cuts (or spending plans) over time is to measure them as a percentage of the national economy. Inflation-adjusted dollars are another option, but a percentage of gross domestic product helps put the impact of the bill into context. Trump\u2019s tax cut, according to Treasury Department data, is nearly 0.9 percent of GDP \u2014 compared to 2.89 percent of GDP for Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut. Trump\u2019s tax cut is only the eighth-largest \u2014 and is even smaller than two of Barack Obama\u2019s tax cuts. \u201cOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.\u201d Trump is spinning the effects of his tax plan. Most of the benefits in the tax bill flow to corporations and the wealthy, according to numerous independent analysts. More than three-quarters of the $1.1 trillion in individual tax cuts will go to people who earn more than $200,000 a year in taxable income, who constitute only about 5 percent of all taxpayers, according to a report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service that warned the tax plan will have negative consequences for the fiscal health of federal and local governments. Advertisement Many of the tax cuts for individuals expire in 2025 \u2014 unless renewed by Congress \u2014 while the corporation tax cuts do not expire. The standard deduction was increased, as Trump noted, but personal and dependent exemptions were eliminated, muting the impact of the increase. \u201cWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.\u201d Trump is citing a White House Council of Economic Advisers report that has been widely criticized for the $4,000 estimate, including by the economist whose work is among those cited in making this forecast. (The economist, Mihir A. Desai, told the New York Times that actual income gain would be $800.) [Update: The White House says it did not rely solely on Desai\u2019s research and removed his paper in a subsequent publication.] Desai said he did not think the numbers added up. Our friends at FactCheck.org offered a good illustration. With almost 126 million households in the United States, an average of $4,000 per household would mean an income gain of $500 billion. Yet the United States collected just under $300 billion in corporate taxes in fiscal 2017. [Update: The White House says this is not a fair comparison because so many companies avoided the U.S. tax rates that current tax receipts are lower than they would be under the new law.] Advertisement Conservative economists generally say they expect wages to rise after the corporate tax cut, but few have embraced the White House estimate. \u201cThis estimate is considerably higher than I would expect,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute. The average household would get a tax cut of $1,610 in 2018, an increase of about 2.2 percent in that average household\u2019s income, according to the Tax Policy Center. \u201cSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses \u2014 many of them thousands of dollars per worker.\u201d Trump is citing a list maintained by Americans for Tax Reform, an anti-tax group, which says 285 companies have offered bonuses, pay increases or increased 401(k) contributions because of the tax plan. The group says at least 3 million Americans have received tax bonuses, many about $1,000 or $2,000; the list only identifies one company (IAT Insurance Group of North Carolina) as offering $3,000. Advertisement With about 126 million full-time workers in the United States, less than 2.5 percent have received these one-time bonuses so far. Many of the companies offering bonuses are in the financial services industry. \u201cSince we passed tax cuts \u2026 Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.\u201d Trump suggests Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States over five years because of a tax package he signed into law in December. That\u2019s a stretch. Apple announced a five-year investment plan in January, which includes $30 billion in capital expenditures and roughly $275 billion in domestic spending. This represents the bulk of its $350 billion investment plan. But the company did not say whether these moves were long in the planning or spurred by the tax changes. Apple did say it would be making a $38 billion tax payment to repatriate overseas profit under a provision of Trump\u2019s tax law. Like other big U.S. companies, Apple responded to the tax legislation by handing out bonuses to its employees. Advertisement It\u2019s not clear from Apple\u2019s announcement that it is dialing up U.S. investment levels. The tech giant spent \u201cbetween $12 billion and $15 billion on projects such as facilities or land globally in the past few years, though it has not said how much of that went to U.S. projects.\u201d \u201cIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.\u201d Trump has clearly waged a battle against regulations but many of his claims cannot be verified. Trump appears to be counting \u201cregulatory actions,\u201d so many of the items being delayed or withdrawn were not regulations yet. According to a Bloomberg News analysis, almost a third of the regulatory reversals actually began under earlier presidents. \u201cOthers strain the definition of lessening the burden of regulation or were relatively inconsequential, the kind of actions government implements routinely,\u201d Bloomberg reported. In fact, it is unclear whether Trump has cut more regulations in his first year than any other president. When the Fact Checker examined this question, experts said that the amount of withdrawn regulations is not necessarily the best metric, because these are rules that never went into effect. Moreover, often it takes another rule to repeal a previous rule. Research by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University shows that regulatory restrictions actually grew during Trump\u2019s first year, but at a much slower pace than other presidents in their first year. The Trump administration has made a lot of claims about gains in the coal industry, but virtually none of them are true. (Video: Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) \u201cWe have ended the war on American energy \u2014 and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cclean coal.\u201d Power plants can mitigate some of the effects of burning coal by capturing and burying carbon-dioxide emissions, but that doesn\u2019t cleanse the coal itself. By saying his administration \u201cended the war on clean coal,\u201d Trump appears to be referencing the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan implemented under President Barack Obama, which had pushed states to favor energy sources that produce fewer carbon emissions than coal. Trump also says the United States is \u201cnow an exporter of energy,\u201d but the United States has long been an energy exporter. Trump pledged during his campaign to turn the country into a net energy exporter, meaning it sells more energy to other countries than it buys from them. But that hasn\u2019t happened and the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates it won\u2019t happen until sometime between 2020 and 2030. According to the EIA, the United States was expected to become a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, and exports of crude oil and petroleum products more than doubled from 2010 to 2016. It\u2019s important to note that the United States lifted restrictions on exporting crude oil in December 2015, while Obama was in office. \u201cMany car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States \u2014 something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan.\u201d Trump\u2019s timeline is mixed up. Fiat Chrysler is investing $1 billion in a factory in Michigan, but that plan was in motion before Trump\u2019s election in 2016, according to Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive. Marchionne specifically credited talks with the United Auto Workers in 2015, not Trump. \u201cAmerica is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year \u2014 isn\u2019t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has pointed to building and infrastructure projects from earlier in American history. He made similar claims about the Golden Gate Bridge and the Hoover Dam in June 2017. But in all of these cases, Trump is only focusing on the literal construction time \u2014 ignoring the bureaucratic negotiations, planning and preparation that took place leading up to construction and are required to make large-scale projects feasible. Moreover, for the Empire State Building, it actually took 13 months to build. \u201cThe third pillar ends the visa lottery \u2014 a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of our people.\u201d The diversity visa lottery program, more commonly known as the green card lottery, isn\u2019t random as Trump suggests. Each year natives of a number of countries are not allowed to apply because more than 50,000 people from these countries had been admitted during the last five years. Individuals who apply must have at least a high school diploma, the equivalent or two years work experience, which the State Department specifies, to be eligible for the program. As the term \u201clottery\u201d implies, applicants are selected via a randomized computer drawing. The selected applicants undergo a background check, interview and medical tests before entering the country, and some applicants undergo an additional in-depth review if they are considered a security risk. After which, selected applicants can be deemed ineligible for a visa. A 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office did point to substantial fraud risks within the program and proposed using data to mitigate these risks. However, the State Department at the time disagreed with the report\u2019s findings, saying it already had managed these risks. The same report notes there can be \u2018\u2018difficulty in verifying identities has security-based implications because State\u2019s security checks rely heavily on name-based databases,\u201d something a 2011 report from the House of Representatives suggests could be a national security weakness. It\u2019s clear there are issues with the program, but it is a stretch to say the program has no regard for merit or safety. \u201cThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.\u201d \u201cChain migration\u201d refers to the practice of immigrants bringing other members of their families to the United States. Under U.S. law, there is a preference for relatives already living in the United States, so a U.S. citizen can petition for a green card for spouses, children, parents or siblings. So, for example, a sibling of a U.S. citizen could come to the United States, bringing along spouses and minor children. The rules are stricter for green-card holders: They can only petition for a spouse or unmarried children. The suggestion that either a U.S. citizen or a green card holder could bring in \u201cvirtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives\u201d is an exaggeration to say the least. There\u2019s often a lengthy wait list. As of November, according to the State Department, nearly 4 million people are waiting to get off the list, including 2.3 million \u201cfamily fourth\u201d preferences \u2014 children of siblings of citizens. Three times, the president has told a story that falls upon close inspection. (Video: Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) \u201cIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.\u201d Trump is referring to Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant who entered the United States through the diversity visa lottery program, and Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi immigrant who entered through an extended relative as part of a program Trump calls \u201cchain migration.\u201d Saipov drove a rented truck into a crowd of pedestrians and bicyclists in Manhattan in October, killing eight in the deadliest terrorist attack in New York since 9/11. Ullah attempted to bomb a New York City subway station with a crude explosive device, but the device failed and only Ullah was injured. Trump presents these two cases as evidence that the diversity visa program and chain migration open the door to terrorist attacks. But two immigration cases out of thousands a year is not statistically significant. Note that Trump steered clear of mentioning a new report from the Homeland Security and Justice departments, which links the same two immigration programs to terrorism cases. That report describes two international terrorism-related cases linked to chain migration, and two other cases tied to the diversity visa program. Again, not a statistically significant number. It\u2019s a big deal to claim that any policy exposes the country to more terrorist attacks, and it requires more proof than a few anecdotal cases. \u201cWe are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling and the underprivileged all over the world.\u201d In raw dollars, the United States does contribute more development aid. But the United States is also richer, so as a percentage of gross national income, the United States ranks relatively low, according to 2016 figures published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States contributed $33.6 billion, followed by Germany with almost $25 billion. But Norway contributed 1.1 percent of GNI, whereas the United States ranked 22nd out of 29 wealthy countries tracked by the organization. That ranking placed it between Slovenia and Portugal.

        "claim": "\"John McCain\u2019s chief economic adviser during the \u201908 race \u2026 estimated that Trump\u2019s promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs.\"",
        "doc": "It\u2019s not just Democrats who think America would suffer under a Donald Trump presidency, said Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Take it from \"John McCain\u2019s chief economic adviser during the \u201908 race who estimated that Trump\u2019s promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs,\" said Kaine, a senator from Virginia, in a speech on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. Kaine was referring to a blistering analysis of Trump\u2019s economic proposals published by respected financial firm Moody\u2019s Analytics. When the report first came out in June, Hillary Clinton also jumped on the fact that an adviser to a former Republican presidential candidate had produced such a critical report. But Trump responded to say: Not so fast. Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s chief economist and the report\u2019s lead author, actually supports Clinton and President Barack Obama. So who is this guy? Zandi is a well-respected economist, and politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like him. His latest report, which is sharply critical of Trump\u2019s policy proposals, is a methodical examination that looks at three possible scenarios: one where Trump\u2019s proposals are adopted in full, one where they are adopted on a smaller scale, and one that envisions a compromise with Congress. (Moody\u2019s says a similar report about Clinton\u2019s proposals is forthcoming.) Assuming that Trump\u2019s proposals are adopted in full, the analysts do, in fact, estimate that the economy will be \"significantly weaker,\" and there will be a 3.5 million drop in jobs, as Kaine said. \"Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office,\" the report says. \"By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs, and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7 percent, compared with below 5 percent today. During Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the average American household\u2019s after-inflation income will stagnate, and stock prices and real house values will decline.\" Though others might take issue with some aspects of his findings, the purpose of this fact-check is not to cast doubt on the quality of Zandi\u2019s Trump report or his work generally. We have quoted him as an expert source on the economy in previous stories. Rather, Kaine is using Zandi\u2019s Republican credentials as a former McCain adviser to make the point that even Republicans think Trump\u2019s proposals would be bad for the economy. But it turns out he is leaving out an important piece of information that leaves a giant hole in that particular line of argument \u2014 notably that Zandi has donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to Clinton\u2019s primary campaign. Beyond this presidential cycle, Zandi has donated to a variety of Democrats going back to 2007. Zandi confirmed to PolitiFact that he is a registered Democrat. In the 2008 presidential race, though, he did support Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He donated more than $2,000 to McCain\u2019s campaign, and he was one of several economists advising McCain in an official capacity. But Zandi definitely wasn\u2019t McCain\u2019s chief adviser, as Kaine said, and has called his role in the campaign \"very modest.\" Zandi was a Democrat back then, too, but he told the Wall Street Journal he is \"eclectic\" and that he has done work for members of both parties, a point he has since reiterated. After the 2008 election, though, Zandi turned out to be an important asset to the Obama administration. Zandi told us he wasn\u2019t an official adviser to Obama or the White House, but he has produced research concluding the Obama administration\u2019s response to the 2008 financial crisis was a success. And he was on Obama\u2019s short list to regulate the Federal Housing Finance Agency, though he didn\u2019t get the job. We asked Zandi what he would tell people who question whether his report on Trump is neutral, given his sizeable donation to Clinton and past connections with Democrats. \"We used the same model of the economy we use for all our studies,\" he said. \"And the study is completely transparent. Moreover, the approach we took is the same approach the (nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) takes when evaluating similar fiscal policy proposals. I'm very interested in hearing substantive critiques of our work.\" Our ruling Kaine said \"John McCain\u2019s chief economic adviser during the \u201908 race \u2026 estimated that Trump\u2019s promises would cause america to lose 3.5 million jobs.\" The Moody\u2019s report concluded that Trump\u2019s economic proposals, if adopted in full, could cost 3.5 million jobs. And Zandi was a donor and economic adviser to the McCain campaign. But he was not the chief adviser, and this isn\u2019t the full picture of his political affiliations. As it turns out, Zandi is a registered Democrat and donated the maximum amount to Clinton\u2019s primary campaign. Zandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years. But to identify Zandi only as a former adviser of McCain leaves out a lot of the story about Zandi\u2019s political affiliations.

Using the same doctored photo used in the tweet, we found several anomalies in the image. We found that the original text has been photoshopped by blending the blue background of the hoarding. The smidges of the original text can be seen in the far left corner of the photo.

This suggests it has been digitally added on top of the image. Another noticeable difference is that when zoomed in, the Delhi government (\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930) logo at the top right corner of the photo is blurred. However, the morphed text is clear. The contrast in clarity is also an indication that the image has been tampered with. Performing Digital Forensics On the Image We performed a digital forensics on the high resolution image using the InVid tool. We ran an Error Level Analysis (ELA) and JPEG Ghosts Algorithm analysis of the viral image. Below is the ELA result of the morphed hoarding, which show pixel irregularities in various parts of the image. The inconsistency of the pixels were higher on the text part of the image suggesting the image underwent digital manipulation. ELA Output From InVid The next image below is the result of a Ghost Algorithm Analysis. A Ghost Algorithm Analysis shows if the picture has traces of tampering by highlighting the regions that stand out - these regions are likely to originate from a different JPEG image. On performing the Ghosts Algorithm Analysis we found that the pixels of the texts were highlighted with yellow as well as red shades which suggested that part of the image has undergone digital manipulation Ghost Output From InVid Also Read: \u0938\u094d\u092a\u0940\u0921 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0927\u093e\u0908 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094b\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u091a \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948?

        "claim": "\"Eighty-five percent . . . of Rhode Island tax returns that were filed for the year 2010 . . . were from individuals who earned $30,000 or less.\"",
        "doc": "One of the unsuccessful amendments proposed during the General Assembly's debate on changing the pension system for state workers called for calculating pension benefits using the average pay over the last 10 years of employment, not the last three or five years.The sponsor, Rep. Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, a Woonsocket Democrat, said the measure would prevent last-minute raises from bumping up a person's pension benefits. Taxpayers, she said, can't afford such largess.\"I'm going to give you a little fact that I was given by the general treasurer, which was pretty astonishing, and that is that 85 percent . . . of Rhode Island tax returns that were filed for the year 2010 . . . were from individuals who earned $30,000 or less. Only 15 percent of Rhode Islanders filed tax returns and earned more than $30,000,\" she said during the debate on the House floor.That's a lot of people making a very modest income -- in fact, in Baldelli-Hunt\u2019s words, it's a \"pretty astonishing\" number.It was astonishing -- and worthy of more careful checking than Baldelli-Hunt undertook.It turns out Baldelli-Hunt was never directly told that 85 percent of Rhode Islanders make $30,000 or less. She said she calculated that percentage based on what she was told during an Oct. 31 meeting with General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and two members of her staff.As Baldelli-Hunt recalled the meeting, Raimondo said well over 400,000 tax returns filed for the 2010 tax year reported incomes of $30,000 or less. The state representative said Raimondo's number was either 468,000 or 486,000. (She would use the lower, more conservative, number in her calculation.)Baldelli-Hunt said a financial consultant who was with her at the meeting also recalls a number of over 400,000 and \"we nearly fell off our seats when we heard that, and that put in perspective how Rhode Islanders are struggling.\"On Nov. 17, when the pension proposal was being debated, Baldelli-Hunt took that number and divided it by 554,870, a number her financial consultant pulled off the Internet that was supposed to represent the number of 2010 tax returns filed with the state.The calculation gives you 84.3 percent.That\u2019s how she arrived at her 85-percent figure.First of all, 554,870 is not the number of 2010 tax returns. It\u2019s actually the number of 2009 returns filed by early June of 2010. Also, it includes the returns of people who don\u2019t live in Rhode Island.When we called Raimondo's office and also Paul Dion, chief of the state's Office of Revenue Analysis, they referred us to the final report on resident income tax returns for the tax year 2009. Both said it was the most recent data that breaks down the returns by income category.That report paints a very different picture.It says the state received 483,392 returns from Rhode Island residents that year, with 230,289 reporting incomes of less than $30,000.That's 48 percent, not 85 percent.We were curious whether it made a difference to include the tax returns of non-residents, including people who live out of the state but who file here because they work here. Of the 91,231 non-residents who filed in 2009, 27,818 earned under $30,000. Folding those number into the mix brought the percentage down to 45 percent.Baldelli-Hunt said she is sure of what she heard from the treasurer. Perhaps, she speculated, when Raimondo was looking at the number of returns reporting income of less than $30,000, her eye mistakenly jumped one column to the left, to the 483,392 number, which is the total number of returns.The correct percentage -- 48 percent -- still means that \"half of working people in the state make $30,000 or less,\" she said. \"It's almost shocking.\"Raimondo spokesman Joy Fox, who was not at the meeting, said the treasurer always uses the 2009 statistics and no one can recall giving Baldelli-Hunt different information.Our rulingWe can't say whether Baldelli-Hunt is accurately recalling something she heard from Raimondo. There is no audio recording of the meeting.We can only rule on the accuracy of Baldelli-Hunt's statement when she said that 85 percent of Rhode Island tax returns, filed for the 2010 tax year, reported income of $30,000 or less.The most-recent income data, from 2009, show that the ratio is 48 percent, far less than what she stated. (The state isn't scheduled to release an income breakdown of its 2010 returns until sometime around March 2012.)That 48 percent turns out to be fairly typical.State reports from 2005-2008 show that the percentage doesn't change much year to year, so it seems extraordinarily unlikely that even when the 2010 tax return numbers come out, the percentage will jump to anything close to 85 percent.Carl Sagan, the late astronomer, liked to say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We agree.Baldelli-Hunt described the statistic was \"pretty astonishing.\" It would have served her well to double-check it before using it during debate on the biggest issue to come before the General Assembly this year.Her assertion that 85 percent of tax returns report income of $30,000 or less -- based on a hasty calculation -- is not only false but ridiculous, we rule her statement Pants on Fire.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

But this represents only half of all tertiary opportunities available in 2015.In addition to the places available at universities, Nzimande announced that there were a further 81,000 places at technical and vocational education and training colleges, 85,900 apprenticeships and learnerships, 16,250 artisan opportunities and 37,423 learning programme opportunities.Malema downplayed the number of places available at the university.

Cast your ballot early, take it back and cast a new one? In Wisconsin, ifyou act quickly enough, you can do it, whether you voted in-person absentee or absentee by mail. The act is knownas \"spoiling,\" something that has been permitted in Wisconsin for many years. \"It\u2019s something that, prior to this year, very few people have done,\" Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Of course, 2016 has been unlike most any other election year. And it alsoapplies in reverse -- folks who voted early for Trump could take back their ballots, too. How spoiling works According to a Wisconsin Elections Commission news release issued on the same day of Trump\u2019s speech: Once you have been issued a ballot, whether at the polling place, at the clerk\u2019s office or by mail, you can ask to spoil your ballot as long as the ballot has not been cast and get a new one in the event you make a mistake or change your mind. When voting by mail, spoiling your ballot requires contacting the clerk\u2019s office and requesting a new ballot be sent to you. The deadline for most voters to make that request is Nov. 3, 2016. Voters who have already mailed absentee ballots back to the municipal clerk\u2019s office can go to the clerk\u2019s office and make the request for a new ballot in person. The deadline to request a new absentee ballot would the last day the clerk offers in-person absentee voting. For most clerks, that is Nov. 4, 2016, but voters should contact their municipal clerk for scheduled hours. Absentee voters cannot spoil their ballot at their polling place on Election Day. That was prohibited by a 2011 state law. Voters in at least three other states -- Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- also accommodate early voter\u2019s remorse, according to news articles in the past two days by the Washington Times, ABC News and Fox News. The National Conference of State Legislatures doesn\u2019t have a list of states that allow re-casting a ballot. In some instances, it may come down to the discretion of a local election official, spokesman Mick Bullock said. Our rating Trump says: \"Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake.\" As long as you do it in time -- in Wisconsin, severaldays before election day -- you can \"spoil\" your original ballot and cast a new one. At least three other states allow re-voting, too. We rate Trump\u2019s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a44566ab-602e-42cc-bac3-47e4efcdee04",

        "claim": "\"In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion\" for its $300 billion to $400 billion economy, which is \"like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury.\"",
        "doc": "While President Barack Obama has hammered the point that the sole goal of the nuclear accord with Iran was to prevent it from building a bomb, many of America\u2019s allies in the region are at least as concerned about a more immediate threat. They fear that an economic revival in Iran would allow it to build its military and boost its funding of proxy fighters who oppose Israel and key Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, raised that issue July 13, 2015, at a major gathering in Washington of Christians United for Israel, an evangelical group. \"That deal will not bring peace closer. It will bring war closer \u2014 making conventional war more likely today and the horrors of nuclear terrorism more likely tomorrow,\" Dermer said. He posted the speech on his Facebook page. A short bit later, Dermer talked about the impact of unfreezing Iranian assets. \"The promise of phased sanctions relief looks more like a one-time jackpot for the Ayatollah regime,\" he said. \"In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion. Iran has a $300 (billion) to $400 billion economy. A $150 billion infusion of cash into Iran\u2019s coffers is like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury.\" Dermer did not say where he got his numbers or elaborate on his analogy.We asked the Embassy of Israelin Washington to clarify Dermer\u2019s statement but did nothear back. Absent hearing from the source, we assume that the underlying math runs as follows: $150 billion is half of $300 billion (the low end of Dermer\u2019s estimate of Iran\u2019s GDP). The U.S. economy is over $16 trillion ($18.1 billion in 2015), so half of that gives you the $8 trillion Dermer cited. The reality of the deal's effectis much more complicated than Dermer's math lets on.And though there are issues with his numbers,thefundamental flawis hislogic. He treatsGDP, which is the sum of all goods and services generated by a nation\u2019s economy, as if it were the same as the government\u2019s bank account. This is sort oflike saying your yearly income is the same as your checking account. Most Americans would like that to be true, but it isn\u2019t.The two are completely different, and so are GDP and national treasuries. So even though it would be fair to note that Iran\u2019s state-owned oil company accounts for a huge chunk of the country\u2019s economy, Iran's access to that money is not like the U.S. treasury getting an infusion of $8 trillion. Agovernment and its economy are not one and the same. Dermer would have been on slightlyfirmer ground if he had said unfreezing Iran's assetswould be like injecting $8 trillion into Iran's economy. But he didn't, and the analytic issues don't stop there. There\u2019s also a problem with the numbers Dermer used. There are different ways to estimate Iran\u2019s GDP, but according to the World Bank, Iran\u2019s economy is $415 billion. If we re-do Dermer\u2019s math, that would mean the equivalent impact in the United States \u2014 regardless of Dermer\u2019s troubled metaphor \u2014 would be about 30 percent lower than he said. It\u2019s also likely that Dermer inflated the size of Iran\u2019s assets that were frozen under sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates the value of Iran\u2019s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. We don\u2019t know where Dermer got $150 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Garbis Iradian is the association\u2019s chief economist for Africa and the Middle East. Iradian told us that the money in those overseas accounts does belong to the government of Iran andabout two-thirds of it comes from oil sales. Sanctions imposed in 2012 forbid the repatriation of those dollars to Iran. If the deal goes into effect, there will be a delay of at least a few months before Iran\u2019s accounts are unfrozen. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Iran is doing what it promised. That certification is being called \"Implementation Day,\" and when that happens, Iran will gain access to its foreign reserves. Does that mean that all of the money will go back to Iran in a great rush? No one knows for sure. Michael Malloy is a law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and the author of The Structure of Economic Sanctions to be published next spring by Cambridge University Press. Malloy said the funds smooth the process when Iran needs to buy things on the international market. The hard currency is in place to transfer to the foreign seller. \"The Iranians will need those facilities,\" Malloy said. \"Those account relationships will continue and a lot of that money will stay.\" Iradian said that in theory, Iran could decide to bring all the money home, but he too suspects that is unlikely. While Tehran might tap $10 billion or even $20 billion, Iradian said the money is a hedge against shifts in the international market, especially the price of oil. (A quick term of art: A country\u2019s current account is the balance between money going out for imports, and the money coming in from exports.) \"If oil prices drop below $50 a barrel, then the current account of the country will be negative,\" Iradian said. \"How will they finance the gap? They will tap their official reserves.\" Iradian described the Iranian central bank managers as prudent. \"The official reserve is a fall back position,\" he said. \"It\u2019s like you keeping money in your checking account in case you lose your job. For Iran, it has security for whenever it has difficulty meeting its foreign exchange needs.\" Iradian has written that the lifting of sanctions, of which unfreezing Iranian bank accounts is a part, will provide a major boost to the Iranian economy. Again, theeffects on the economyare different from the money in Iran's treasury. Our ruling Dermer said that for an economy the size of Iran, unfreezing $150 billion of Iranian assets would be like pumping $8 trillion into the U.S. treasury. There are several problems with this claim. It exaggerates the value of Iran\u2019s frozen assets, underestimates the size of the Iranian economy, and confuses the concepts of a country\u2019s economy and the money in its treasury. While Iran would gain access to foreign currency reserves worth about $100 billion, it is far from certain that the money would go directly into government spending. On the other hand, an amount of money on that scale would have a significant impact on the nation\u2019s finances. The numbers are off and the logic is flawed, but this statement has an element of accuracy. We rate it Mostly False.",

Dobbs introduced Pease as a man who \"has come forward charging postal workers backdated 100,000 mail-in ballots so they could be illegally counted.\" The Lutchman Report website said ballots were backdated \"so that the ballots would be counted even if they arrived after the statutory deadline.\" But that\u2019s simply not possible \u2014 the Wisconsin deadline is based on when ballots are received, not postmarked. Let\u2019s dig into the details. Pease\u2019s claim \u2014 sworn to in an affidavit that is being used in a lawsuit challenging the election results \u2014 is based on two conversations he had with USPS workers while filling a delivery role around the election. Pease said he started his job Aug. 26, 2020, as a temporary employee with United Mailing Services, working as a route and box truck driver in the Madison area. His job was to pick up mail and bring it back to UMS, which then sorted it so he could drive the sorted mail to USPS. That mail included ballots housed in separate bins. Here\u2019s Pease\u2019s description of the interactions the day after the Nov. 3 election. Nov. 4, I was asked by a senior USPS employee named Monte if I had forgotten any ballots the night before. Monte explained that an order came down from the Wisconsin-Illinois chapter of USPS that 100,000 ballots were missing. Monte then told me that his post office had dispatched employees to look for the missing ballots around 4 a.m., and that only seven or eight were found at UMS. Based on my previous experience and habit of double-checking for ballots, I believed that to be a lie. The following day, Nov. 5, 2020, I had a conversation with a different USPS employee named Rachel, in which she admitted USPS employees were ordered to backdate ballots that were received too late to be lawfully counted. At this point we can\u2019t address the validity of Pease\u2019s claims, though it\u2019s noteworthy they come from a temporary employee of a subcontractor based on his interpretation of conversations, not any direct observation. The USPS did not immediately respond to an email asking if they are investigating the matter. But we do know this had no impact on the election results. The widely shared social media posts built around Pease generally connect his claims to illegally counting those votes, though Pease never made that claim himself in the press conferences or Fox appearances. And that connection is fraught with logical impossibilities. The biggest by far is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Wisconsin voting deadline. An array of litigation on absentee ballots in Wisconsin ended Oct. 26 with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling absentee ballots would only be counted if they were returned by Election Day \u2014 upholding previous practice. Democrats and other nonpartisan groups had sought changes allowing ballots to be counted if they were postmarked by Election Day, even if they were received later. So local election workers across the state only counted absentee ballots that were submitted by the time polls closed on Election Day. The entirety of Pease\u2019s allegations involve actions taken Nov. 4 and 5. In terms of the vote tally, it doesn\u2019t matter what USPS employees did with ballots at that point. No election officials were going to count them. And the entire state had already reported its election results (Milwaukee County was last about 4 a.m. Nov. 4) In Madison, where Pease worked, the last election results were reported the night of the election. Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, summed it up this way, addressing Pease\u2019s claims: \"In Wisconsin, no ballots received after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, November 3, could be counted, period. It doesn\u2019t matter when they were postmarked. This was extensively litigated in federal courts in the weeks prior to the election and everyone, including the post office, knew that postmarks were immaterial to whether ballots were counted in Wisconsin.\" We should also note that some conspiracy theories online connect the timing of Pease\u2019s comment \u2014 a ballot search at 4 a.m. Nov. 4 \u2014 to the \"vote dump\" claims that allege a jump in votes for Democrat Joe Biden in the wee hours of Nov. 4 is somehow questionable. The vote dump claim has been repeatedly debunked: The increase in votes was simply when the City of Milwaukee finished counting its absentee ballots, which were predictably heavily in Biden\u2019s favor. But the connection is illogical on its face as well. It\u2019s ridiculous to assert a jump in reported votes occurred at the same time employees were searching for ballots across an array of facilities. That supposed correlation leaves no time for ballots to be transported to election officials, verified, counted and added to tallies. Our ruling An array of social media posts have seized on statements from a \"whistleblower\" to say the USPS backdated 100K ballots so they could be counted illegally. We can\u2019t yet gauge the validity of the back-dating claims, but we do know it\u2019s ridiculous to say this affected the Wisconsin vote totals. Absentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day to be counted, and all state election results were reported by the early morning hours of Nov. 4. Pease\u2019s claims relate to actions allegedly taken Nov. 4 and 5. Whatever happened to ballots then, no one was going to count and include them. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "If the virus is exposed to a temperatureof 26 - 27 degrees celcius it will be killed",
        "doc": "The viral message on novel coronavirus is NOT issued by UNICEF. A viral post on social media claims that coronavirus dies at a temperature above 26 \u2013 27 degrees Celcius. It further states that drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick. Staying away from icecream and cold drink is also advised in the viral post. The message in the viral post mentions UNICEF as its source of information. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral message is fake. Claim A post shared on social media by a page named Clean and Green Services reads: Coronavirus Information Source: UNICEF. IF THE VIRUS IS EXPOSED TO A TEMPERATURE OF 26 \u2013 27 DEGREES CELCIUS IT WILL BE KILLED, AS IT DOES NOT LIVE IN HOT REGIONS. ALSO DRINKING HOT WATER AND SUN EXPOSURE WILL DO THE TRICK AND STAYING AWAY FROM ICE CREAM AND COLD FOOD IS ADVISED. The archived link of the post can be checked here. Investigation As can be seen, the message in the post mentions UNICEF as its source of information. Vishvas News spoke to Dr. Kanupriya Singhal, Health Specialist, UNICEF and shared the viral image with her. She said that UNICEF didn\u2019t send out such a message. \u201cUNICEF has NOT released any such report.\u201d According to the viral post, the novel coronavirus dies at temperatures above 26/27 degrees. However, medical experts have not made such specific claims about the new virus. As per Dr. Kanpuriya Singhal, \u201cThe sensitivity of this virus to temperature is not known as yet. It is important to rely on only trusted sources of information like the official website of Health ministry, WHO website or UNICEF websites. Fake posts and misinformation should not be shared on social media without verifications.\u201d Christopher Tidey, Communications Specialist, UNICEF replied to us over mail, \u201cThat post is NOT from UNICEF and is not accurate. All around the world, people are taking the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families from coronavirus. Sound preparation, based on scientific evidence, is what is needed at this time. However, while many people are sharing information about the virus and how to protect against it, only some of that information is useful or reliable. Misinformation during times of a health crisis can result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus. It can also spread paranoia, fear, and stigmatization, and have other consequences like offering a false sense of protection.\u201d Vishvas News further investigated and found a report on the official website of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As per the report, \u201cIt is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.\u201d The viral post further states that drinking hot water and sun exposure will help. We found no evidence that drinking hot water, being exposed to the sun could prevent infection. As per Dr. Sajeev Kumar, General Physician, \u201cThis is not proven. There is no cure for novel coronavirus so far. Coronavirus is spread through close contact with an affected person having respiratory issues like coughing and sneezing.\u201d The viral post also states that people should stay away from icecreams and cold drinks. When we investigated we found that Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Partnerships has released a statement on coronavirus misinformation. The statement refutes such misleading claims on coronavirus, \u201cA recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue.\u201d Vishvas News earlier debunked a similar claim that can be checked here.

        "claim": "The Indian Army had a 'Muslim regiment' that refused to fight in the 1965 war.",
        "doc": "The Indian Army didn't have a Muslim regiment during the 1965 war; however, soldiers from the Muslim community did fight against Pakistan. Context: \ufeff A post on social media claims that the Indian army had a Muslim regiment in 1965 that refused to fight the war against Pakistan. One of the Twitter users said, \"Muslim Regiment which had refused to fight during the Indo-Pak war... Do you think they can serve the country by becoming IAS and IPS??\" The post further claims that during the 1965 war, the Muslim regiment also went to Pakistan to extend their support. However, similar claims have emerged several times in the last few years, and the allegations made are baseless and have been debunked. In fact: On researching the website of the Indian Army, we didn't find any regiment called \"Muslim regiment\" in the list of army regiments. On October 15, 2020, Deccan Herald published a letter to the President of India by a group of retired soldiers. The letter has denied the existence of a Muslim regiment in the Indian Army. It added, \"These 'Muslim Regiment' posts are blatantly false because the Indian Army did not have a Muslim Regiment in 1965 or since.\" They have added that the false claims about Muslim regiments would cause damage to the social fabric of the nation and the confidence of the soldiers. We found a blog written by a retired Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain with the caption \"The 'missing' Muslim regiment: Without comprehensive rebuttal, Pakistani propaganda dupes the gullible across the board.\" The blog was published by the Times of India on November 29, 2017. In the blog, General Hasnain mentioned that the news circulating the so-called Muslim regiments \"is nothing but a ham-handed but potentially mischievous campaign by Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).\" Lieutenant General clarified, \"There was no Muslim Regiment ever and certainly not in 1965.\" He added that the Muslims, who were in other multi-class regiments, had proven their commitment and worth in fighting in the war. He further said that after independence in 1947, most Muslim officers and soldiers in the Indian Army migrated to Pakistan. Then there were only subunits that consisted of only Muslims in many units of the Grenadiers, the Rajputana Rifles, the Rajput Regiment, and some cavalry regiments. There have been many claims on social media in recent times that intend to create a communal divide across India. It is evident that the Twitter post claiming that the purported \"Muslim regiment\" of the Indian army refused to participate in the 1965 war is baseless and being spread as propaganda to question the commitment of the Muslim community in India towards their country. The verdict: There is no evidence that the Indian Army never had a Muslim regiment. Such assertions are baseless and have been created to meet a specific narrative. Thus, we are marking this claim as false. ",

        "claim": "Says he \"helped bring\" Uline company to Kenosha area, \"creating 800 local jobs.\"",
        "doc": "Bob Wirch, one of the two Democratic state senators in Wisconsin facing a recall election Aug. 16, 2011, tells voters they should keep him in office because of his record on creating jobs in his Kenosha-based district.But can the former factory worker and 19-year lawmaker, who is being challenged by Republican Jonathan Steitz, fairly claim part of the credit for coaxing an Illinois company to bring hundreds of jobs over the border? The claim is made in a flier Wirch\u2019s campaign mailed July 25, 2011 to voters. The flier cites Uline, a national distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials, and includes this headline:\"Bob Wirch helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs.\"So, did he?Uline describes itself as a family-owned company that employs 2,600 employees across the country. It was founded in 1980 by Dick and Liz Uihlein; Dick Uihlein is the great-grandson of the founder of the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., one of Milwaukee\u2019s famed beer makers.The company was headquartered in Waukegan, Ill., just south of the Wisconsin border, when it announced n June 2006 that it would expand in Pleasant Prairie, a Kenosha suburb about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. Both Wirch and Steitz, a lawyer who is making his first run for public office, live in the village.Uline made big news in January 2008, when it announced it would move its headquarters to Pleasant Prairie and build a distribution center there, investing $100 million and employing 1,000 people by 2010. The company also said it would utilize state government incentives that were later calculated to be worth up to $18.6 million over nine years.The Wirch campaign flier led Dick and Liz Uihlein to issue a statement in response on Aug. 3, 2011.\"We worked with a variety of state and local officials during the relocation process; however, state Sen. Wirch was not one of them,\" the couple said in the statement, noting they do not support Wirch\u2019s campaign.That\u2019s a strong rebuttal to Wirch\u2019s claim that he aided in the company\u2019s move.The statement also noted that a bill Wirch sponsored to help Pleasant Prairie with economic development -- which is also mentioned in his campaign flier -- was not introduced until July 2011 -- months after Uline had completed its relocation. The bill was \"by no means a determinative factor in our decision to relocate,\" the company\u2019s statement said.When Wirch\u2019s bill was signed into law in August 2011, Wirch said it would lead to 800 new jobs in Pleasant Prairie being created through a future expansion at Uline and the launching of a new biotechnology business incubator, according to the Kenosha News.But those 800 jobs are only projected, not already created, as the headline in Wirch\u2019s campaign flier stated. Only some of the jobs are expected to come from Uline. And, in any case, they have nothing to do with Wirch\u2019s claim that he helped Uline relocate to Wisconsin.When asked to respond to the statement issued by Uline, Wirch said in an email to the Racine Journal Times that he had toured Uline in 2010 \"and discussed with company leadership the importance of a strong workforce and well-trained workforce.\"But touring Uline after it had relocated hardly equates to helping land the company in the first place.Also responding to Uline\u2019s statement, Wirch campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Kenosha News that all references to Uline would be omitted from future campaign materials. \"Sen. Wirch is very respectful of Uline\u2019s wishes and he has no intention of misrepresenting them,\" Walzak was quoted as saying.We asked Gillian Morris, another spokesperson for Wirch\u2019s campaign, for evidence that Wirch helped Uline\u2019s relocation from Illinois. She argued the statement Dick Uihlein issued was \"politically motivated\" since he had contribute to the anti-tax Club for Growth. That\u2019s not even on point.The statement in question from Wirch is his claim that he \"helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs.\" We found there is no evidence to back the boast.Uline brought roughly that number of jobs to Wirch\u2019s state Senate district by the time it concluded its move from Illinois in 2010. But the company said it didn\u2019t work with Wirch at all on the relocation. And the bill Wirch makes reference to wasn\u2019t signed into law until long after Uline had relocated.Wirch\u2019s claim of helping land a big new employer is not only false but ridiculous -- or, Pants on Fire. Editor\u2019s note: After this item was posted Aug. 12, 2011, Wirch\u2019s campaign provided us additional information -- pointing to a bill other than the one cited in the original flier as evidence Wirch helped bring Uline to the area. That bill, sponsored by Wirch, allowed for business expansion in the area of Pleasant Prairie where Uline moved.However, the bill was introduced Jan. 25, 2008 -- three weeks after Uline had already announced its relocation Uline\u2019s chief financial officer, Frank Unick, would not comment on whether the bill played a role in the relocation.Pleasant Prairie Village Administrator Mike Pollocoff said part of the company\u2019s expansion could not have occurred without the bill, which also affected other companies. But by that point, Uline had already committed to the $100 million relocation. So, we feel it\u2019s a stretch to say the bill \"helped bring\" the company to Pleasant Prairie.",

        "claim": "\"Since February 2009, the private sector has lost millions of jobs while the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers.\"",
        "doc": "Rep. John Boehner, as House minority leader, is not bashful when it comes to criticizing the Obama administration and arguing that his Republican party offers a better way. Boehner seized that opportunity again during an appearance at the City Club of Cleveland.His targets were familiar ones: health care reform, the stimulus program, slow economic recovery and federal government running amok.\"Since February 2009, the private sector has lost millions of jobs while the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers,\" the Ohio Republican said.Boehner's statement is a popular claim among Republicans when criticizing the White House and Democratic leadership in Congress. PolitiFact has checked out variations of the statement three times, including once involving Boehner. In each case we've arrived at similar conclusions, that while there's some truth to some of the statement, it glosses over important information.Careful readers will notice that previous PolitiFact stories cited somewhat different numbers than what follows below. That's because previous claims were made - and adjudicated by PolitiFact - based on the most up-to-date data for government, private-sector and census-specific hiring. But those numbers change each month, and PolitiFact uses current numbers unless a claim is based on a specific month's data. For example, a recent analysis of a hiring claim made by Rep. Steve LaTourette used May data because LaTourette based his claim on May numbers, which were fairly current at the time. Here we use new preliminary numbers available from July.First let's look at Boehner's contention that the private sector has lost millions of jobs. When we looked into the job figures previously, Boehner's office referred us to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, and said that they started the count from January 2009. By starting with that month's figure, all jobs lost in February 2009 and after would be included.In January 2009, there were 110,961,000 private-sector jobs in this country, according to the BLS database of employment statistics. By the end of July 2010, BLS says, there were 107,737,000 private sector jobs. The July figure is a preliminary number that could be adjusted upward or downward as more data becomes available. But as it is now, that's a drop of 3.224 million jobs -- or as Boehner told the City Club, \"millions of jobs.\"The biggest job hemorrhages came in February and March of 2009, when 707,000 and 744,000 jobs disappeared. Job losses slowed down into last summer and fall. During the first five months of 2010, though, there were actually job gains.But what about the other part of Boehner's claim; that \"the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers\"?BLS data shows that there were 2,803,000 federal employees in January 2009. By the end of July this year, there were 3,017,000 federal workers, according to preliminary BLS figures. That's a gain of 214,000 federal jobs, or as Boehner put it, \"hundreds of thousands of workers.\"But here\u2019s the problem. Most of the growth of the federal workforce came entirely from the temporary buildup of census workers.For example, the government brought on 411,000 temporary U.S. Census Bureau workers in May 2010. But one month later, 225,000 temporary census workers completed their work and were let go. Another 143,000 finished their jobs in July.What all this means is that from January 2009 through this July, there was a net increase of 191,000 new federal jobs. Exclude those workers hired for the census and total federal hiring comes to only 23,000.We think that's an important caveat to consider.The House minority leader is right on the money when he says millions of private sector jobs were lost. But his reliance on the temporary hiring of census workers to support the notion that the government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers shortchanges accuracy.That's why we rate this statement, just as we have previous similar claims, as Half True.

Advertisement The nation\u2019s nearly 400 immigration judges are under a mountain of backlogged cases, and hundreds of thousands of Central Americans continue to arrive at the border each year. Because of a lack of holding capacity and a court settlement requiring the release of children, U.S. immigration authorities allow many migrant families into the country while they wait for hearings. On CBS, Pence claimed that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d never show up. On CNN, he said the rate of no-shows was \u201cplus-90 percent.\u201d The rate of no-shows is far below 90 percent, according to the Department of Justice\u2019s most recent annual figures. When using the Justice Department\u2019s preferred metric, 44 percent of migrants who were not in custody failed to show up for their court proceedings. That\u2019s half the rate Pence claimed. And some researchers say that the Justice Department numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story and that the real rate is less than 44 percent. The Facts A migrant either attends a court hearing or doesn\u2019t attend. It\u2019s a yes-or-no question that lends itself to simple math. Yet the numbers vary widely. Advertisement Because immigration court records are secret, the government\u2019s statistics are difficult to verify. Some of them measure a subset of immigration cases and tell one story. Some numbers crunched by researchers tell another story. The picture can be blurry because an immigration case may involve several hearings over more than one year. We reviewed statistics from the Justice Department (which runs the immigration courts), the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the border) and independent researchers analyzing court records. The Justice Department reports no-show statistics based on \u201cinitial case completions,\u201d a metric that doesn\u2019t count some migrants who show up for court but have their cases postponed or who don\u2019t get a resolution. Completed cases sometimes are reopened and result in different outcomes. Advertisement Pence\u2019s claim distorts what acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a June 11 hearing. The panel chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), asked \u201cwhat percentage of the people show up for the asylum hearing?\u201d \u201cSo, it depends on the demographic, the court, but we do see too many cases where people are not showing up,\u201d McAleenan said. \u201cWe did an expedited pilot with family units this year with ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the immigration courts. Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 [percent] received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is a recent sample from families crossing the border.\u201d Notice how McAleenan framed his answer. The 90 percent rate he gave was based on a sample of 7,000 cases being fast-tracked through the immigration courts, not all cases. Advertisement A representative for Pence told us he \u201cwas referring to a pilot program launched under DHS,\u201d the same one McAleenan brought up to the Senate Judiciary Committee. But Pence did not hedge his comments as McAleenan did and instead indicated that 90 percent of all migrants never show up for court. When CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged him, Pence dug in. \u201cThe overwhelming majority, plus-90 percent, don\u2019t show up,\u201d he said. Graham\u2019s question was about asylum hearings, not about all immigration cases. From fiscal 2013 through 2017, asylum applicants received deportation orders \u201cin absentia\u201d in 6 percent to 11 percent of cases per year, according to the most recent statistics yearbook from the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review. The term \u201cin absentia\u201d is used when someone didn\u2019t show up to court. Advertisement Let\u2019s take a look at the different statistics measuring court appearance rates for migrants. McAleenan In September, the Justice Department began to prioritize immigration cases for family units \u201cwith the goal of completing these cases within a year of initiation,\u201d a DHS official told us. This fast-track initiative is sometimes called the \u201crocket docket.\u201d \u201cAs of April 2019, out of approximately 7,700 total removal orders for rocket docket cases, over 6,700 were in absentia,\u201d the DHS official told us. That\u2019s 87 percent. When Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) challenged these numbers at the June 11 hearing, McAleenan said, \u201cI gave you the recent numbers of over 7,000 families that we put through a process to try to get court results more quickly: 90 percent of them did not show up for their hearings.\u201d Advertisement McAleenan didn\u2019t claim that this no-show rate of 90 percent applies broadly to all migrants. He was talking strictly about the rocket docket. These figures come from the Justice Department, which reports court appearance rates on the basis of initial case completions, as we\u2019ve noted. That measure will not count migrants who show up for court but whose hearings are postponed or whose cases remain pending. \u201cEarly numbers from a \u2018rocket docket\u2019 is a really horrible place to get in absentia rates, since those who are fighting their cases have not had sufficient time to be resolved and rocket dockets tend to cause more in absentia orders,\u201d Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an email. \u201cSince the docket is brand-new, pretty much the only cases which had ended [as of April] were the ones where the person missed court, so that number ignored the huge number of pending cases where the family had appeared but the case was ongoing,\u201d Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an analyst at the American Immigration Council, wrote in an email. Advertisement \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen, many migrants who claim asylum and are permitted into the U.S. often disappear before a judge decides the case in court,\u201d the DHS official said. \u201cThis act directly undermines legal immigration procedures. We have and continue to take unprecedented action to ensure the integrity of the immigration process.\u201d Justice Department The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) publishes yearly statistics detailing the number of migrants who were issued deportation orders after failing to show up for court. These numbers are based on initial case completions. Pierce said \u201cthese rates only count final decisions, not pending cases in which people are attending their hearings.\u201d \u201cI usually try to use older FYs [fiscal years] to talk about in absentia rates, because for the older numbers there\u2019s been more time for the slower-moving cases in which people are attending to resolve,\u201d she added. The EOIR statistics include four categories: \u201cnever detained,\u201d \u201creleased,\u201d \u201cunaccompanied alien children\u201d and \u201casylum.\u201d They also include a total for all cases. Judges ordered in absentia removals in 14 percent of all cases in fiscal 2013, a rate that grew to 28 percent in fiscal 2017. Advertisement An EOIR fact sheet from May highlights that 44 percent of non-detained migrants were ordered out of the country after missing their court dates. That means 56 percent, a majority, did show up. When we previously asked EOIR about this, a spokeswoman for the office told us the asylum category includes some migrants who are in custody and thus are unable to skip their court dates. Focusing on migrants who aren\u2019t detained is a reasonable way to assess the data when trying to determine how many skip their hearings, though we note that the asylum category includes a mix of people who are both detained or released (there\u2019s no breakdown in the EOIR yearbook). The Justice Department for this fact-check highlighted other data points. Spokesman Alexei Woltornist said \u201conly 13 out of every 100 credible fear claims are granted asylum\u201d and sent us this flow chart. (That\u2019s notable, but asylum grant rates don\u2019t indicate how many migrants attend their court hearings.) Back to the rocket docket. It\u2019s a pilot program in 10 cities. Woltornist said the rate of in absentia deportation orders for family units had decreased to 82 percent as of June 14. An EOIR table shows that 56,286 cases had been opened on the rocket docket, 13,313 of them had been initially completed, and judges had issued 10,877 in absentia removal orders. (A footnote says that EOIR relies on DHS officials to identify family units and that these numbers don\u2019t include all the families currently in immigration court proceedings nationwide.) TRAC Researchers at the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University in a June 18 report found that 81 percent of migrant families attended all their court hearings, measuring from September through May. \u201cThus, court records directly contradict the widely quoted claim that \u201990 Percent of Recent Asylum Seekers Skipped Their Hearings,\u2019\u201d the report says, linking to an article about McAleenan\u2019s testimony on June 11. How is it possible that 81 percent of families attend all their hearings, when the Justice Department says the attendance rates are much lower? (And not just the Justice Department \u2014 an older data set from TRAC covering 2014 to 2018 shows that 49 percent of families attended their hearings.) Susan B. Long, the co-director of TRAC and a managerial statistics professor at Syracuse University, said the difference is in counting all ongoing cases instead of only completed cases. \u201cWe didn\u2019t remove anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly how the data is recorded.\u201d Of 46,743 families, 85.5 percent attended their initial hearing and 81 percent attended all their hearings, according to TRAC. \u201cMost have had only one scheduled hearing,\u201d Long said. For those families with legal representation, the attendance rate was 99.9 percent at the first hearing and 99 percent for all hearings, the TRAC report says. Woltornist, the Justice Department spokesman, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly where they got the numbers.\u201d The TRAC report says researchers obtained records from the nation\u2019s immigration courts by filing requests to EOIR under the Freedom of Information Act. The Pinocchio Test This game of telephone went badly awry. McAleenan gave flawed statistics in response to Graham\u2019s question. They were not about asylum hearings and they covered only those families with cases on the rocket docket. That\u2019s a pilot program in 10 cities, so it doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening nationwide. The numbers McAleenan gave ran from September to April. A small share of the rocket docket cases had been completed in that period. Because of the way the Justice Department reports court appearance rates for migrants \u2014 based on completed cases \u2014 the numbers from McAleenan presented an inflated picture of how many skip their hearings. In absentia cases are closed right away; ongoing cases in which families initially show up for court are not factored into the statistics. But this is a fact-check of the vice president, who went on national television and claimed \u201cplus-90 percent\u201d of migrants skip their court hearings. It\u2019s a Four Pinocchio claim relying only on the Justice Department\u2019s figures. We noted flaws in McAleenan\u2019s numbers, but he disclosed that he was talking about a pilot program limited to 7,000 cases. Pence did not make the same distinction on CBS or CNN. He spoke in terms of all immigration cases nationwide. The Justice Department\u2019s preferred metric shows that 44 percent of migrants who are not in custody miss their court hearings. That\u2019s half the rate Pence claimed. TRAC\u2019s analysis shows that when counting court appearances instead of completed cases, and when counting all family units instead of only those on the rocket docket, the vast majority of migrant families attended their hearings from September through May.

        "claim": "No farmers died of suicide in the last eight years of Modi's rule claimed BJP MP Nishikant Dubey",
        "doc": "On August 1, 2022, Dr Nishikant Dubey, BJP MP from Jharkhand\u2019s Godda made a statement in Parliament. He alleged that in the last eight years, the opposition did not discuss farmers\u2019 suicide because farmers were not dying by suicide. Dubey stated in Hindi, \u201cDid the opposition ever have a single discussion about farmers\u2019 suicides in the last eight years? If they didn\u2019t, it means farmers are not dying by suicide. We (BJP) have given so much power to farmers that today the farmers\u2019 are agitating. And what is the condition of the farmer? Modi\u2019s government was in power for the whole year and the same amount of funds was provided to the farmers. And that\u2019s how we strengthened farmers enough to continue agitating for over a year, but no farmer died by suicide.\u201d Did no farmers die by suicide in the last eight years? Alt News performed a Google search to investigate the statement made by MP Nishikant Dubey in the Lok Sabha. In October 2021, NDTV India published a report about farmers\u2019 suicide in 2020. Quoting a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, the article states that a total of 1,53,052 cases of suicide were reported in 2020. Out of these, a total of 10,677 cases of suicide were reported in the agriculture sector. Of which 5,579 suicides were of farmers and 5,098 suicides were of agricultural labourers. It is worth noting that these figures represent just 2020 alone. In his statement, Dubey referred to the eight years under the rule of Narendra Modi, i.e. from 2014 to 2021. We examined the data from 2014 to 2020. (The data for 2021 is not yet available on the NCRB website.) A total of 1,31,666 people died by suicide in 2014. As per the data, 5,650 farmers died by suicide in 2014. There is not much of a difference between these and the 2015 figures. That year, 8,007 farmers took their own lives, out of a total of 1,33,623 deaths. The following year, a total of 1,31,008 people died by suicide. Of them, 8.7 per cent were involved in the agriculture sector. The report states that in 2016, 11,379 people engaged in agriculture died by suicide, out of which 6,270 were farmers and 5,109 were agricultural labourers. This slideshow requires JavaScript. According to NCRB data, a total of 1,29,887 cases of suicide were registered in 2017. Of these, 8.2% were from the agriculture sector. 10,655 people employed in the agriculture sector had died by suicide, of which 5,955 were farmers and 4,700 were agricultural labourers. Similarly, in 2018, out of a total of 1,34,516 suicide cases, 10,349 were related to the agriculture sector. This figure accounts for 7.7% of the total suicide cases. In other words, in 2018, 5,763 farmers and 4,586 agricultural labourers died by suicide. At the same time, in 2019, 10,281 people working in the agricultural sector died by suicide, which accounts for 7.4% of the total figures. Of these, 5,957 were farmers and 4,324 were agricultural labourers. This slideshow requires JavaScript. An Aaj Tak report dated July 28, 2021, contains data on farmers\u2019 suicide in each state of India from 2017 to 2019. According to this data, Maharashtra and Karnataka reported the highest number of farmers\u2019 suicides in the country. In Maharashtra, 2,426 farmers died by suicide in 2017, 2,239 in 2018 and 2,680 in 2019. On the other hand, in Karnataka, these figures are 1,157, 1,365 and 1,331 respectively. The same data can be found on data.gov.in on farmers\u2019 suicides in different Indian states in 2018 and 2019. To sum it up, according to NCRB data, between 2014 and 2020, 78,303 people involved in the agricultural sector died by suicide, of which 43,181 were farmers. These figures clearly refute the claim made by Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey. Therefore, the BJP MP falsely stated that no farmers\u2019 suicide occurred in India without citing any evidence in the Lok Sabha. Donate to Alt News!

        "claim": "Social distancing doesn't work because air droplets can travel up to 25 feet.",
        "doc": "During an anti-lockdown event on 24 July, dubbed the \"The Worldwide Rally For Freedom\" , Vernon Coleman (who we have fact checked before, under his online pseudonym \"Old Man In A Chair\" ) made a speech in Trafalgar Square where he made dozens of false and misleading claims. These incorrect claims include that up to 14 million people will die because of lockdown, wearing masks will \"make children stupid\" and that Covid-19 is no more dangerous than flu. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in Neil Fergurson and mathematical modellers did not say \"tens of millions\" of people would die from Covid-19 Early on in his speech, Mr Coleman accused mathematical modellers and former  government advisor Professor Neil Ferguson of claiming \"that we were all going to die, millions and tens of millions of people were going to die\" because of Covid-19. There is no record of Neil Ferguson or other mathematical modellers saying this. This claim may be based on a report by Imperial College, published in March last year and co-authored by Professor Ferguson, which estimated that, if no action was taken, 510,000 people in the UK and 2.2 million in the US could die from the disease. It was not a prediction of how many people would die if actions like lockdowns were taken. As of 17 August, 4.37 million people globally have died of Covid-19. Between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year die from the flu globally, but this is still fewer than how many died from Covid last year During his speech, Mr Coleman said the flu \"usually, and can, kill up to 650,000 people a year\". While the World Health Organization estimates that between 290,000 and 650,000 people globally suffer influenza-related respiratory deaths each year, it also estimates that at least 3 million were reported to have died from Covid-19 in 2020. Data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) shows that between 1 January and 31 August 2020, long before the roll-out of any of the vaccines, the number of people in England and Wales who died where Covid was the underlying cause (48,168) was far greater than those where flu (394) or pneumonia (13,619) was the cause . According to think tank the Health Foundation , on average (in a bad flu year) around 30,000 people die from flu and pneumonia in the UK. It also points out that years of life lost from flu and pneumonia are around a sixth of those lost to people who died of Covid. On average, every person who died of Covid-19 lost around 10 years of life. We've written more about comparisons between the flu and Covid-19 before. Flu and Covid-19 are not the same and there is no evidence the government thought coronavirus was no more dangerous Mr Coleman also said the government knew that \"Covid-19 is no more dangerous than the flu\" before lockdowns were imposed. He says evidence of this still exists on government websites, which he has signposted to on his own website. But the link on Mr Coleman's website takes you to Public Health England guidance on high consequence infectious diseases (HCID ). This is a list of serious diseases which usually have high fatality rates and are difficult to recognise and detect rapidly . Covid-19 was added to this list in January but then declassified on 19 March as more data became available about mortality rates and a specific test for the illness was developed, meaning it no longer met the criteria for an HCID . Later that month lockdowns came into force. On his own website, Mr Coleman says this is proof that the government knew the disease was downgraded to \"flu level\" as a full lockdown was imposed. This appears to be what he is referring to in his speech. However this is not true. While Covid-19 does not have the same case fatality rate as diseases on the HCID, this does not mean it is not dangerous nor that it is the same as the flu. There is little to no evidence to support the claim the government considered Covid-19 was no worse than the flu. By 2 March scientists had warned ministers of the potential of 500,000 deaths in the UK. By 12 March, Boris Johnson had publicly stated : \"Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous.\" Mr Coleman also claims that Covid-19 is \"just the flu, rebranded. It's a well marketed version of the flu.\" We've covered the misleading claim that Covid-19 is the same as the flu on a number of occasions. We have also recently reappraised this claim. It is difficult to make a direct comparison between Covid-19 and influenza because the full, global rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines has not yet been implemented, but the unique differences in fatality rates, symptomatic transmission rates and the long-term harms caused by each condition makes it misleading to say the two are alike. No evidence that 12 to 13 million people will die through combination of lockdown, flu and pathogenic priming. Mr Coleman also suggests the death rate in winter will be enormous, because \"people have been locked down, because the flu is going to come back, because pathogenic priming is going to kill people who have the vaccine.\" While the effects of the lockdown, such as the growing NHS waiting list, may influence otherwise preventable deaths, available estimates do not match the number of deaths Mr Coleman quotes and there appears to be little other evidence that any other effects of lockdown contribute meaningfully to such a high number of fatalities. As mentioned earlier, in a bad year flu on average kills around 30,000 people in England and Wales while the WHO estimates between 290,000 and 650,000 people globally suffer influenza-related respiratory deaths each year. There are some fears flu deaths could reach as high as 60,000 this winter but this nowhere nears the 12 to 13 million figure Mr Coleman quotes. The Department for Health and Social Care and the Office for National Statistics published a report last year that tried to estimate the impact of lives lost as a result of \"lockdown-induced recession\". The report estimated that in the medium-term, the effects of a recession caused by lockdown could lead to 18,000 excess deaths every two to five years, predominantly due to cardiovascular disease. It also provides a \"pessimistic\" estimate of the impact of a 2-month lockdown, meaning it estimated what the most damaging outcome could be. Using this type of worst-case modelling the report suggested lockdown could cause up to 52,000 excess deaths. By contrast its most optimistic modelling suggested lockdown could lead to 800 fewer deaths, compared to life outside of it. However, there is no clear figure on the impact of lockdown on mortality and even the report warns that \"All of these estimates are based on arbitrary, purely illustrative, assumptions... and therefore their reliability and robustness are considered to be very low.\" The paper goes into further detail about lockdown's potential impact on excess deaths in social care and delays to medical care, which was covered in-part by some media outlets , but nowhere do these projections come close to the 12 to 13 million figure Mr Coleman quoted. As for pathogenic priming, this is another name given to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a mechanism whereby antibodies, generated from a previous immune response, don't stop you from getting ill again and instead exacerbate your immune response, worsening whatever disease you have. It is very rare and while there is some evidence of ADE-type reactions to the SARS and MERs vaccines (which are both types of coronavirus), there has been no evidence of ADE reactions to Covid-19 vaccines. Social distancing is effective even if air droplets can travel up to 25 feet Mr Coleman claims that social distancing \"was always a joke because a cough or a sneeze can travel 25 feet.\" Studies have shown that in some circumstances a sneeze can propel air droplets up to 26 feet and coughing 18 feet. However, other evidence suggests that while you are still susceptible to infection at more than two metres, a significantly greater number of infectious droplets are transmitted at distances shorter than that. While there is debate about whether two metres is still too close for social distancing to be totally effective , papers published by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) during the course of the pandemic stated the risk of close-range transmission of Covid-19 \"grows exponentially as distance reduces below 2m\". Masks do far more good than harm and are effectively worn by surgeons in theatre In his speech, Mr Coleman both claims he knows of \"100 scientific papers, proving conclusively that masks do more harm than good\" and that \"a lot of surgeons don't wear masks these days, because it's been proven that they don't do any good.\" Although there are rare instances of harm involving some of the tightest masks, such as N95 or FFP2 masks, ordinary masks are not harmful. We have looked at similar claims many times before , as have other fact checking services. While there exists debate about the efficacy of masks used in surgery , there is at least some evidence available which show they do good. In a meta-analysis of 15 studies, researchers found they were effective in decreasing \"biological loads in theatre environments\". Professor Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England told Full Fact: \"Wearing protective personal equipment (PPE) including face masks remains absolutely critical to protecting the health both of medical staff and their patients. \"COVID-19 is an airborne virus, so masks are an important tool helping reduce transmission. If you enter a healthcare setting, then do please remember to wear a mask.\" No evidence that masks cause dementia, hypoxia and hypercapnia, bacterial pneumonia, and will make children \"stupid\" Mr Coleman goes on to make a series of more specific claims about the effects of masks including that they cause hypoxia, hypercapnia, bacterial pneumonia and will make people \"demented in 10 years time\". He also alleges that \"kids at school who wear masks will be the stupid kids in a few years time\". We have already debunked the claim that face masks cause hypoxia (a medical term for low levels of oxygen in the body) , as have other fact checkers . The WHO has said that, while facemasks can be uncomfortable, surgical face masks do not lead to oxygen deficiency. We've also debunked the claim that masks cause hypercapnia, a condition that leads to an excess of CO2 in the bloodstream. A review of evidence on mask wearing, which investigated harm, showed that while some people who wore N95 masks had elevated carbon dioxide levels and reduced oxygen levels, the same was not the case with surgical masks or other types of masks. There is no evidence that mask wearing increases the risk of contracting bacterial pneumonia . There is also no evidence that wearing a face mask will cause dementia, although this claim has also been made by other conspiracy theorists. Researchers examining the links between air pollution and dementia even suggested the benefit face masks could have to neurological health where air quality is poor. The Covid-19 vaccines are not experimental At one point, Mr Coleman claims Covid-19 vaccines have been given \"to 7 billion as a test\", suggesting the global vaccination programme is experimental. It's not true that all vaccine recipients are taking part in a trial and we have dealt with this type of claim on a number of occasions . All of the Covid-19 vaccines authorised for use in the UK have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. It's normal that authorities continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines even after they have been approved. This monitoring happens with all vaccines, including those that have been in use for years, to detect any adverse effects. Just because studies into these vaccines are continuing, doesn't mean anyone getting the vaccine in the nationwide roll-out is part of an experiment. Reports of deaths following vaccination are not proof that anyone has died from vaccines Mr Coleman suggests the death toll caused by Covid-19 vaccinations is 18,928 in the EU,  11,405 in the US and 1,470 in the UK. None of this is true. As of 14 July 2021, only 10 days before the Freedom Rally, around 5,200 deaths had been reported following vaccination among the four authorised Covid-19 vaccines across the EU. The European Medicines Agency says that \"the fact that someone has had a medical issue or died after vaccination does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused this.\" According to the most recent data, the United States' Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received 6,340 reports of deaths following vaccination, far fewer than Mr Coleman's quote. The CDC says it has not established a \"causal link\" between reported deaths and vaccines, although there are indications of such a relationship between the \"J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event - blood clots with low platelets -  which has caused deaths.\" The claim for the UK is also untrue. It is based on around 1,500 reports sent to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of a fatal outcome shortly following vaccination. However, the regulator says reviews of individual reports and patterns of reporting do not suggest the vaccines caused these deaths. Confusingly, despite quoting a much lower figure for the UK first, Mr Coleman later went on to say that 5,522 people had died from the vaccine in Scotland. This is based on figures from Public Health Scotland (PHS) which state 5,528 people had died within 28 days of being vaccinated , a statistic not recorded by the MHRA. However, once again, this figure does not show vaccinations led to death. It is just the number of people who died roughly within a month of having a vaccine. Nicola Sturgeon's Covid advisor Devi Sridhar did claim the Pfizer vaccine was \"100% safe for children\" At one point, Mr Coleman refers to Devi Sridhar, a member of the Scottish government's Covid-19 Advisory Group, and a segment recorded for children's TV show Newsround about Covid vaccines. Mr Coleman said: \"In the UK, the BBC gave airtime to a woman called Devi Sridhar\u2026 and Sridhar said on the BBC that the vaccine.... was 100% safe for children.\" Professor Sridhar said on children's TV show BBC Newsround that the Pfizer vaccine specifically was 100% safe for children. This was later amended on the Newsround site to state they had removed \"a reference by a contributor that the Pfizer vaccine is \"100% safe\" The website also included a statement from the MHRA which said: \"We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk.\" Full Fact recently fact checked a misleading analysis of Ms Sridhar's interview. There have been tests to assess the safety of combining or overlapping Covid-19 and flu jabs Mr Coleman also says that in the autumn a Covid-19 jab and a flu jab will be offered at the same time. He then goes on to claim: \"Guess how many people have been tested having two jobs at the same time? If your guess is naught, then you're right.\" Researchers have been assessing the use of Covid and flu vaccines at the same time, but it is not true that there has been no analysis of the interactions between the two vaccines. Other research suggests that combining Covid and flu vaccines are safe and effective although other studies are ongoing.",

Everything\u2019s made here.\u201d \u2014 Trump, in an interview with Trish Regan of Fox Business News, Oct. 16 \u201cWho are we hurting? It\u2019s 500,000 jobs. It\u2019ll be ultimately $110 billion. It\u2019s the biggest order in the history of our country from an outside military.\u201d \u2014 Trump, in an interview with Stuart Varney of Fox Business News, Oct. 17 \u201cI would prefer that we don\u2019t use, as retribution, canceling $110 billion worth of work, which means 600,000 jobs.\" \u2014 Trump, during a defense roundtable at Luke Air Force Base, Oct. 19 \u201cSo now if you\u2019re talking about \u2014 that was $110 billion \u2014 you know, you\u2019re talking about over a million jobs. You know, I\u2019d rather keep the million jobs, and I\u2019d rather find another solution.\u201d Advertisement \u2014 Trump, in additional remarks to reporters after the roundtable, Oct. 19 President Trump is not very precise with numbers, but this is getting ridiculous. He keeps citing U.S. jobs supposedly at risk if arms sales are cut off with Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Not only has the purported number of jobs from a highly tentative arms deal with the Saudis kept climbing day after day, but in the course of few minutes, Trump appeared to go from 600,000 jobs to 1 million. To be fair, he appeared to be saying that all of the deals he struck in Saudi Arabia \u2014 which he valued at $450 billion \u2014 would create 1 million jobs. But that\u2019s just as fanciful. (We had earlier documented that the commercial agreements announced after his 2017 trip to the kingdom were mostly smoke and mirrors, with many of the purported deals aimed at creating jobs in Saudi Arabia, not the United States. At the time, Trump claimed they were worth $350 billion.) Advertisement In his various statements, the president also claims that all of the arms-deal jobs being created would be in the United States, but that\u2019s not true. Saudi officials have said that they will insist that 50 percent of the spending will be in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi jobs, if the tentative agreements are to go forward. The Facts We\u2019ve learned over time that the president does not pay much attention to details. So while he keeps increasing the number of jobs that he says would result from this deal, he might be surprised to learn what the official White House statement said when the deal was signed: \u201cThis package demonstrates the United States\u2019 commitment to our partnership with Saudi Arabia, while also expanding opportunities for American companies in the region, potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.\u201d Advertisement \u201cTens of thousands\u201d is much, much lower than 600,000. Even that might be a stretch, though note that the statement uses the phrase \u201cpotentially supporting,\u201d rather than \u201ccreating,\u201d jobs. That means the White House could have been counting not just new factory workers but also secondary jobs resulting from the \u201cfeedback\u201d of employed defense workers. (In theory, each dollar spent by a newly employed person reverberates through the economy, creating jobs for dentists, librarians, bread bakers, farmers, bartenders and so forth.) According to a confidential 2017 document of all of the military sales agreements reviewed by The Fact Checker, most of the items on Trump\u2019s $110 billion list did not have delivery dates or were scheduled for 2022 or beyond. There appeared to be few, if any, signed contracts. Rather, many of the announcements were MOIs \u2014 memorandums of intent. There were six specific items, adding up to $28 billion, but all had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration. Moreover, the Aerospace Industries Association says that in 2016, there were 355,500 manufacturing jobs supported by the entire defense and national security industry, generating $146 billion in annual exports. So it\u2019s hard to imagine that $110 billion in deals with Saudi Arabia, spread over a decade, would significantly add to that total, let alone more than double it. For context, the U.S. economy is worth about $20 trillion a year. Advertisement On March 20, when Trump greeted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House, he claimed 40,000 jobs were being created by about $19.4 billion in deals (most of which had been negotiated by President Barack Obama). \u201cSome of the things that we\u2019re now working on and that have been ordered and will shortly be started in construction and delivered: the THAAD system \u2014 $13 billion; the C-130 airplanes, the Hercules, great plane \u2014 $3.8 billion; the Bradley Vehicles \u2014 that\u2019s the tanks \u2014 $1.2 billion; and the P-8 Poseidons \u2014 $1.4 billion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd what it does is it really means many, many jobs. We\u2019re talking about over 40,000 jobs in the United States.\u201d The White House never provided an accounting of how the 40,000-jobs figure was determined, so we are dubious that it\u2019s a reliable number. But even if we were to generously apply that same metric to $110 billion \u2014 one job for every $485,000 spent \u2014 you end up with only about 225,000 jobs. Advertisement Note that Trump on March 20 mentioned THAAD \u2014 the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system. The Saudis let a September deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin lapse, despite a 20 percent price cut given by Trump. So, for now, he cannot even count on the THAAD, which was one of the biggest elements of the $110 billion wish list. Okay, Trump\u2019s estimate of the number of potential jobs is highly exaggerated. But then he doubles down on the falsehood by claiming, \u201cIt\u2019s 500,000 jobs, American jobs. Everything\u2019s made here.\u201d One of the few \u201cdone deals,\u201d according to administration officials, is a $6 billion agreement to sell Lockheed Black Hawk helicopters. But the contract says the helicopters will be manufactured and assembled in Saudi Arabia. A Lockheed spokesman said the agreement would \u201csupport\u201d 200 jobs at the company in Connecticut and 250 through \u201cthe supply chain\u201d in North America, indicating that these are not new jobs in the United States. Advertisement A key part of the crown prince\u2019s Vision 2030 economic plan is that 50 percent of military spending will be done in Saudi Arabia. In August, in an interview with Defense News, Saudi Arabian Military Industries chief executive Andreas Schwer said: \u201cThose [$110 billion in foreign military sales] will be subject to our new scenario. We will apply for each and any of those contracts with the 50 percent localization rule, to be in line with Vision 2030.\u201d In other words, only half of the $110 billion, if the deals were actually inked, would be spent in the United States. Defense expert William Hartung has written that a hallmark of Trump\u2019s overseas military sales is they allow for the manufacture of U.S. military equipment in other countries, \u201cdespite President Trump\u2019s campaign claims that he would protect and increase U.S. manufacturing jobs in America. These offers include support to Canada to help manufacture F-404 and F-414 aircraft engines and to Japan to manufacture, integrate, and install Patriot Missiles, among others. While these offers may help secure major arms deals, they can also cut some U.S. manufacturing jobs in future if U.S. companies can\u2019t compete against foreign countries making the same items at lower costs.\u201d As a result, Hartung said, \u201cmany of the major U.S. arms sales will likely create jobs in foreign countries rather than in the United States.\u201d Advertisement Oh, one other thing: Trump keeps saying this is the biggest military sales order in U.S. history. Given that most of the agreements have not been completed and that it\u2019s only a wish list at this point, he has no basis to make that claim. Obama offered Saudi Arabia $115 billion in deals, about half of which resulted in actual sales. We asked the White House for an explanation of the president\u2019s remarks but did not get a response. The Pinocchio Test The president is both exaggerating the number of jobs that would be created even if all of the $110 billion in purported sales were actually inked \u2014 and misleading about where they would be created. Many would end up in Saudi Arabia. Even if the figures did not increase by 50,000 from day to day, they simply are not credible. Trump earns Four Pinocchios.

        "claim": "\"300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans\" because of Obamacare, a plan Alex Sink supports.",
        "doc": "Critics of the health care law like to throw around talking points that give the idea that the law will increase the ranks of the uninsured. The evidence, though, tends to contradict that. That hasn\u2019t stopped political ads from continuing to push the point. The latest case: The race to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla. Democrats are hoping to pick up the seat with Alex Sink, a former banking executive who\u2019s previously held statewide office as Florida\u2019s chief financial officer. Her opponents are David Jolly, a Republican and one of Young\u2019s longtime aides, and Libertarian Lucas Overby. The National Republican Congressional Committee recently began airing ads attacking Sink for her support of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law. The ads begin with photos of Obama and House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \"Alex Sink\u2019s loyalty is to them, not Florida. Why else would she continue to support Obamacare? 300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans,\" the ad claims in part, concluding, \"She\u2019s fighting for them. Not us.\" The ad phrases its claim very carefully, but its statement still leaves out much of the story. And where does that 300,000 number come from anyway? The number comes from 300,000 policyholders that insurance company Florida Blue identifiedback in October. That was when insurers were required to notify policyholders if their insurance plans didn\u2019t meet the rules for new plans requiring comprehensive coverage. The rules were intended to phase out \"bare bones\" plans that didn\u2019t include things like prescription drugs or hospital stays. Florida Blue had 300,000 customers whose plans didn\u2019t meet the new rules. So Florida Blue sent them letters informing them that their plans would end and offering guidance on how to get signed up for a new plan. \"Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them,\" the company said at the time. \"Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014.\" We should note that there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about these 300,000 policyholders. For example, some of them may have gone to the federal marketplace to buy insurance. If their income was below 400 percent of the poverty level (below about $94,200 for a family of four, for example), they would have gotten a subsidy to buy insurance. Some of these people may end up paying more but getting more robust coverage. It\u2019s unclear how many, if any, would simply stop buying coverage altogether. Back in October, Florida Blue told PolitiFact Florida that it intended to work with customers to get them into new plans. Spokesman Mark Wright said that when it comes to getting new plans, \"nobody is throwing anybody off a cliff.\" We reached out to Florida Blue to see if it could tell us anything more about how the letters have played out. Spokesman Mark Wright said the company was giving their policyholders another year to keep their coverage after President Barack Obama asked insurers to allow customers who wanted to keep the old plans to keep them for an additional year. One final note: PolitiFact Florida rated a similar but not identical statement claim from Sen. Marco Rubio back in October. Rubio said, \"300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don\u2019t have health insurance.\" PolitiFact Florida found that claim Mostly False because Rubio failed to fully explain the situation behind the number and wrongly insisted that the people wouldn\u2019t have insurance in 2014. The NRCC\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t go quite as far. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee said in an ad that \"300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans.\" We know that the insurer Florida Blue had to end plans for 300,000 customers when their plans didn\u2019t meet the law\u2019s new requirements for health insurance. But Florida Blue also said it intended to help its customers select and sign up for new health care plans, not leave them without options, and the customers got an additional year, if they needed it, to make a transition. The ad makes itsound as if people would lose their plans without any replacement. Overall, we rate the ad\u2019s claim Half True.",

No, that's not true: a story that claimed Kevin Moody from Ellesmere Port had found his old phone still 70% charged while cleaning out a drawer was published by a satire website as a joke to mock the relatively low standby times achieved by modern smartphones. The story originated from an article published by The Chester Bugle on August 23, 2019 titled \"Nokia 3310 found in drawer after 20 years still has 70% battery\" (archived here) which opened: Kevin Moody, a roofer from Ellesmere Port, has recently cleared out his 'man draw' looking for a key to the shed when he stumbled upon his old Nokia 3310 mobile phone. The phone was still switched on, and had been forgotten about for 20 years. Incredibly the phone still had just over 70% battery remaining. ... Users on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail: Nokia 3310 found in drawer after 20 years still has 70% battery - The Chester Bugle Kevin Moody, a roofer from Ellesmere Port, has recently cleared out his 'man draw' looking for a key to the shed when he stumbled upon his old Nokia 3310 mobile phone. The phone was still switched on, and had been forgotten about for 20 years. Incredibly the phone still had just over 70% battery remaining. ... The Chester Bugle carries a satire disclaimer on the 'about page' which reads: The Chester Bugle is a satirical news website, written by a bunch of nut jobs. It's not actual news, even though it may look like it to some people. If you read something that gets you all het up and in a twizzle, calm your tits - it's almost certainly made up. Feel free to share stories from this website, but do so in the knowledge they're written as jokes or satirical comment on the world's affairs - nothing more. So the story was made up by \"a bunch of nut jobs\". Still, we looked into the matter and found that the Nokia 3310 had a standby time of 55 hours. Not quite 20 years but nothing to sneeze at. However compare that to the 'new' 3310 introduced by Nokia in 2017: Nokia 3310 (2017) Vs Nokia 3310: What's The Difference? The unthinkable has happened. In February it was confirmed the iconic 3310 is making a comeback via a partnership between Nokia and its exclusive Finnish handset developer HMD. But this isn't simply a rebuild of the classic 3310. 17 years have passed and a lot has changed. These are the important differences... Specifically the part about battery life: When you give up so many power hungry features, there's one major goal behind them: battery life. And here the new Nokia 3310 runs rings around every modern smartphone on the market: Nokia 3310 (2000) - 900mAh removable battery, 2.5 - 4 hours talk time, 55 hours standby Nokia 3310 (2017) - 1200mAh removable battery, 22 hours talk time, 31 days standby Yes, the 2017 Nokia 3310 can last up to one month between charges, around 30x more than you'll get out of your iPhone 7 and Galaxy S8. You'll be able to go on a two week holiday and not even need to pack a charger, mindblowing by today's high powered smartphone standards. A full month! Still not 20 years, but getting closer!",

        "claim": "Biden is not proposing a 52% income tax rate for anyone earning above $29,000",
        "doc": "Social media users have been sharing posts that claim President Biden is proposing a 52% tax rate on incomes above $29,000 a year, meaning that the $15 per hour minimum wage he is proposing would leave people with $7.20 per hour net pay. In February 2020, Reuters debunked the exact same claim with the same figures but featuring the name of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in the same text. Under Biden\u2019s tax plan, a 52% income tax rate (which includes a 12.4% payroll tax) would only apply to those earning over $400,000. The posts (here,here,here) calculate that Biden\u2019s proposed minimum wage of $15 per hour would amount to $31,200 per year. They then say, \u201cBiden wants free health care for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was (to) raise taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 per year.\u201d This comment is followed by calculations which show that if the income of $31,200 per year was taxed at 52% the individual would receive a net salary of $7.20 per hour: \u201cSo much for the $15 an hour minimum wage.\u201d In February 2020, Reuters fact-checked the same claim made against Bernie Sanders and found it to be false, as Sanders\u2019 proposed 52% tax rate applied to incomes over $10 million, as seen herehere. Biden and many of his fellow Democrats want to more than double the minimum wage by 2025 from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour. On Feb. 25, the Senate parliamentarian ruled the chamber could not include the proposed $15-an-hour minimum wage in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus recovery bill (here). But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on March 2 the House of Representatives will consider the $15 minimum wage in the \u201cnear future\u201d, without giving specifics (here). Biden\u2019s tax plans include an increase to the top income tax rate for taxable incomes above $400,000 per year from 37% to 39.6%, as explained by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Tax Foundation, which are independent public policy\u202fthink\u202ftanks based in Washington, D.C. (here,here). Biden also plans to subject wages above $400,000 to a 12.4% payroll tax, half of which is paid by employers and half by employees (here). As such, a 52.0% tax on income would only apply to those in the highest tax band as they would pay both sides of this payroll tax (here). Reuters found no mention of changing the tax rate paid by those in the lowest income bracket in the Tax Foundation and Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explanations of Biden\u2019s tax plan, nor in this breakdown by Investopedia, which explains: \u201cA key element of the President's policy is the use of tax credits, often refundable, rather than tax deductions, to counter the greater savings that deductions provide to higher-income taxpayers compared to lower- and middle-income individuals\u201d (here). At the time of publication of this article, the marginal tax rate (as referencedhere) for a household making more than $29,000 (and below $40,525) is 12%. Reuters has previous fact-checked other claims related to Biden\u2019s tax plans (here,here,here).",

New Delhi (Vishvas News): Many claims around Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Morbi visit are going viral on social media. One among them claims that the district administration spent Rs 30 crore on the PM\u2019s visit, and also that this information was obtained from an application filed under the Right to Information (RTI) act. Vishvas News investigated and found this claim to be false, and election propaganda aimed at influencing the voters. The RTI cited in the viral post is fabricated. The Morbi district administration has denied the claim of having filed and responded to any such RTI. On the other hand, the viral screenshot purported to be the news published in the Gujarati newspaper is also digitally created. No such news has been published in the Gujarati newspaper. Claim Social media user \u2018Radheshyam Yadav\u2019 shared a post (archived link) having a screenshot of a tweet by Trinamool Congress leader Saket Gokhale. It claimed that the post has been obtained through an RTI query. The post detailed how Rs 30 crore was spent on Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Morbi; out of which, Rs 5.5 crore was used purely for the welcome, event management, and photography. Many users were posting similar claims on different social media platforms. Investigation Saket Gokhale\u2019s tweet (archive link) is still active on Twitter. Meanwhile, when questioned by a user about the screenshot in the Twitter post, another user Daksh Patel replied- \u2018Gujarat Samachar\u2019.

During his visit, he also held a high-level meeting with officials in Ahmedabad. As the viral post claims about getting the expenses incurred by the Morbi local administration, Vishvas News contacted Morbi District Magistrate GT Pandya, who informed, \u201cNo such RTI was filed in the District Magistrate\u2019s office and when the RTI was not filed then where is the question of answering. This post is fabricated and fake.\u201d Schedule for GE to the Legislative Assembly of Gujarat. #GujaratElections2022 #ECI pic.twitter.com/0A6CSUIJV5 \u2014 Election Commission of India #SVEEP (@ECISVEEP) November 3, 2022 However, in a new development on Monday night, a few media outlets like this and this reported that Gujarat Police arrested Saket Gokhale over the tweet about the Morbi bridge collapse. Importantly, the results of the Gujarat Assembly Elections 2022 are set to come out on December 8, 2022. Conclusion: The claim that Rs 30 crore was spent on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Morbi is fake and fabricated. The screenshot purported to be the news published in \u2018Gujarat Samachar\u2019 is also fake. The Morbi district administration has also refuted any such claims.

        "claim": "Says there are \"$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed [health care law].\"",
        "doc": "A discredited claim is making a comeback following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding most of the national health care reform law.U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said in a press release on Thursday that the law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, makes cuts to Medicare.\"My constituents simply cannot afford the $500 billion in new tax increases and $500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation, nor can our economy sustain the job-killing mandates and regulations it imposes,\" Runyan, a Republican representing parts of southern New Jersey, said in a press release.Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, repeated the claim in his statement about the high court\u2019s ruling, saying \"Obamacare cuts Medicare - cuts Medicare by approximately $500 billion dollars.\" Both claims distort the truth, as our PolitiFact colleagues have found many times.The law aims to slow future growth in Medicare spending. It does not cut from the Medicare program.The health care law made several changes to Medicare, which provides health insurance for millions of seniors and people under 65 receiving Social Security disability payments.Some of the changes will increase Medicare spending to help cover prevention services and to fill the so-called doughnut hole, a gap in prescription drug coverage for some enrollees, according to a tutorial by Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project for the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that analyzes the health care system.Other changes aim to reduce growth in Medicare spending, by more than $500 billion over 10 years, though estimates of the future savings vary.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have both released reports since the health care law passed showing that the Affordable Care Act will reduce future spending growth on Medicare by more than $500 billion.The Affordable Care Act \"contains numerous provisions that, on balance, will reduce federal spending on Medicare,\" the CBO said in a June 2012 report.The biggest portion of that savings, according to Neuman\u2019s tutorial, will come from reducing annual increases in payments to medical providers. But the health care law does not cut $500 billion from Medicare. It just reduces future growth.With the law, Medicare spending will still increase.It\u2019s important to note, as PolitiFact has found, that the savings from the reduction in Medicare spending will help offset spending on other provisions of the health care law, a point that Runyan noted in a statement to PolitiFact New Jersey.\"The CBO projects Medicare savings of approximately $500 Billion and instead of using that money to shore up the program, the savings are diverted from Medicare and used to fund other provisions of ObamaCare. Even worse, this piece of legislation is hitting individuals, working families and small businesses with a massive tax increase that will further cripple the economy and slow job creation,\" Runyan said. Our rulingRunyan, repeating a Republican talking point about Obama\u2019s health care law, said there are \"$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation.\"The legislation aims to slow projected spending on Medicare by more than $500 billion over a 10-year period, but it does not cut that money from the program. Medicare spending will increase over that time frame.Still, a sliver of truth exists in this claim, because the difference in the spending will help offset costs of other provisions in the law.We rate this claim Mostly False.

Claim: Image of a dog lying next to the arm of a human trapped under the rubble caused by the recent earthquake in Turkey on 06 February 2023. Fact: The image is available on multiple stock image repositories at least since 2018. However, information about the specific location of this image not known. While it is believed that hundreds of people are still feared to be stuck under the debris, this viral image is not related to the recent earthquake in Turkey. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. More than 11,000 are feared dead and still thousands are believed to be stuck under the rubble, following the earthquake in Turkey. Visuals of people being trapped under the rubble and being rescued have been reported in large numbers by media agencies (here & here). These visuals are also being circulated on social media platforms. However, the viral image of a dog lying next to someone trapped under the debris is not related to the recent earthquake in Turkey & Syria. Reverse image search of the photo reveals that it is years old and has nothing to do with the recent earthquake in Turkey. Through reverse image search, we came across the same image on multiple stock image repositories (here, here, and here). The oldest upload is on Alamy, dating back to 18 October 2018. The description associated with the image implies that it is related to an earthquake. However, there is no specific mention of the location of this image. To sum it up, an old image of a dog lying next to a human trapped under rubble is being shared attributing it to the recent earthquake in Turkey.",

The archived version of the post can be found here. Claim: On attempt to test 5G in the Netherlands 297 birds died due to high frequency. Fact: Over 300 birds died in Hague but the reason for their death was not a 5G frequency test. WBVR Laboratory in Lelystad and National History Museum have concluded that the cause of death was not due to harmful viruses or experiments conducted by humans. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When searched for the news on Google with the keywords \u201cBirds died in the Netherlands\u201d, it was found that the news regarding the deaths of birds went viral last year. Hundreds of birds died in Hague last year at Huijgenspark, close to Hollands Spoor station. While it is true that birds died, the reason for their deaths was not found. Many fact-checkers have written articles at that time debunking the hoax that the 5G experiment has caused the deaths. According to the Snopes article, the 5G experiment as a reason for birds\u2019 deaths was first posted by John Khules, an anti-5G activist. Later on, he posted saying that he was not serious when he said that 5G experiment was behind the deaths of birds. But, his initial comments went viral by then. In an additional investigation by Snopes, it was found that no 5G test was conducted in the surrounding areas on the day of the deaths. According to the latest information available on the internet, \u2018The Holland Times\u2019 published an article in February 2019 explaining the reason behind the mass deaths of starlings. According to the article, WBVR Laboratory in Lelystad and National History Museum have concluded, \u2018the starlings must have forcefully flown towards and collided with the ground in a sudden fit of panic, upon arrival or departure from their resting places, and these impacts were fatal.\u2019 They have eliminated any possibility of harmful viruses or human experiments as the reason behind the deaths of birds. The article concludes saying, \u2018the assumed cause of death is that the birds collided with deadly force with each other, with tree branches or with the ground due to being panicked and disoriented.\u201d To sum it up, 297 birds did not die in the Netherlands due to a 5G test.

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.

The National Center for Health Statistics tracks births in whole numbers and percentages, and breaks down those numbers in multiple categories, including race.In May 2012, the Census Bureau confirmed the milestone Booker referenced, but for the year 2011 -- not 2012.\"Last year we said (in a news release) 50.4 percent of our nation\u2019s population younger than age 1 were minorities as of July 1, 2011,\" Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us. \"This is up from 49.5 percent from the 2010 census taken April 1, 2010. But in the news release we didn\u2019t \u2026 look at the period any time before 2010, so we can\u2019t confirm with 100 percent certainty that this is the first time ever so it may very well be true, that statement, but we can\u2019t confirm that based on our written publication.\"Population and birth data for 2012 from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics won\u2019t be available for several months, spokespeople for both agencies said.Next, let\u2019s look at birth data by race for the majority race of non-Hispanic whites and these minority groups: non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic.We looked at Vital Statistics Reports birth data going back to 2000 and found that the highest number of minority births \u2013 2,005,890 \u2013 occurred in 2007. But that wasn\u2019t more than the number of non-Hispanic whites that year: 2,310,333.After 2007, the four years with the highest number of minority births, in order, occurred in 2008, 2006, 2009 and 2005, according to the data. Births of non-Hispanic whites, however, were still higher than minority births in each of those years.We contacted Booker\u2019s press office three times and asked for the source of his data, and we also shared our findings in an e-mail with his press office. We received no response, other than two e-mails acknowledging our requests for comment.Our rulingBooker claimed on \"Bill Maher Overtime\" that 2012 was the \"first year in American history that more minorities are being born than people in the majority.\"Since 2000, the highest number of minorities born in the United States was in 2007, at 2,005,890 \u2013 but there were 2,310,333 non-Hispanic whites also born that year. After reviewing 11 years worth of data, there was no other year in which the number of minority births was higher than that of the majority, non-Hispanic whites.Looking strictly at population breakdowns by race, the Census Bureau said 2011 was the first time a majority of people in the United States younger than age 1 were minorities. Booker\u2019s claim referenced that milestone, but with the wrong year. The mayor said it happened in 2012, but the Census Bureau said it occurred in 2011. Since Booker\u2019s statistic was partially correct we rate his statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.",

Masks are designed to allow proper breathing and oxygenation,\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines told VERA Files in an email. Published as a status update and reproduced in screengrabs by several netizens on Facebook (FB) on May 14, the post argued that breathing in the carbon dioxide exhaled by a person using the mask causes dizziness and \u201cintoxication.\u201d This claim has similarly been debunked by fact checkers across five continents, making the rounds in at least 12 countries as early as April 30. Agence France-Presse, in an interview with Dr. Emilio Herrera, a professor of pathophysiology and expert in hypoxia at the University of Chile, said face masks \u201ccannot generate hypoxia.\u201d \u201cFor that, the mask would have to be hermetically glued to our skin,\u201d Herrera said in Spanish. A fact check by Reuters also says that for the general public, who mostly wear face coverings in short stints during social distancing, it is unlikely for them to suffer extreme complications while wearing a mask. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Reuters: \u201cThe CO2 will slowly build up in the mask over time. However, the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2.\u201d Australia-based epidemiologist Dr. Abrar Ahmad Chughtai of the University of New South Wales also told Snopes that hypoxia is unlikely to take place with cloth and surgical masks because they are not tight-fitting. Chughtai, however, did point out that those with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u201cmay face difficulty breathing\u201d when using some types of tight-fitting masks like respirators. The false posts also claimed that \u201cpeople who serve the public for eight hours\u201d are being counterproductive because they are \u201cintoxicating themselves without knowing it.\u201d A study in 2013 recorded in the U.S. National Library of Medicine website involving 10 nurses who wore N95 masks during two full 12-hour shifts, showed evidence disputing the claim.

It also advised to replace a mask as soon as it is damp, and to not reuse single-use masks. Cloth masks, on the other hand, must be washed routinely, according to the U.S. CDC.

        "claim": "\"Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism.\"",
        "doc": "Hillary Clinton, riding a bump in the polls, kept the heat on Donald Trump during a speech in Cincinnati that marked the first time she had campaigned alongside Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party. \"Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism,\" Clinton said during the speech on June 27, 2016. We don\u2019t take a position on whether Trump actually is one of the top threats facing the global economy. But we thought we\u2019d check to see whether Clinton has solid evidence that professional risk analysts have made that argument. So is Clinton right about how analysts have rated Trump? Basically, yes. When we asked the Clinton campaign what she was referring to, they pointed us to the periodic rankings of global risk published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Economist Intelligence Unit -- an affiliate of The Economist, the London-based newsweekly -- is a research and analysis firm that supplies clients, including businesses, with information about opportunities and risks around the world. The firm made headlines in March 2016 when it listed the possibility of a Trump presidency as one of the biggest threats to \"companies\u2019 capacity to operate at target profitability.\" The rankings are based on \"qualitative\" judgments of a how powerfully an event could affect the world and how likely it is to happen, the firm says. In its March ratings, the firm rated the risks from a Trump presidency as 12 on a 25-point scale. That ranked Trump sixth among the 10-item list of biggest threats, tied with \"the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy.\" But the Trump threat level increased in theJuly 2016 rankings. A Trump presidency now ranks as the third-biggest global threat, with an increased score of 16 on the 25-point scale. In the meantime, the risk from jihadi terrorism has remained constant with a score of 12. In the July ratings, the only higher scores were 20 for \"China experiences a hard landing\" and, in a tie with Trump, a 16 for \"currency volatility and persistent commodity prices weakness.\" Specifically, the firm wrote that \"although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn.\" The writeup cited his \"hostility\" to free trade, his hard line on Muslims, his \"militaristic tendencies,\" his skepticism toward NATO, and his \"indifference\" to nuclear proliferation in Asia. The firm had never rated a pending candidacy to be a geopolitical risk to the United States and the world, an official told Politico. We checked with Robert Powell, the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s New York-based global risk briefing manager, to see whether he thought Clinton\u2019s phrasing was accurate, and he said it was. \"Her quote does accurately describe our global risk scenarios,\" Powell told PolitiFact. \"Despite the high likelihood of more terrorist attacks, the impact on the global economy tends to be relatively slight -- indeed, most global stock markets rose on the day of the Brussels attacks, for instance. However, given that the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, we believe a Trump presidency would have a major impact on the entire global economy.\" Clinton said \"risk analysts\" -- plural -- had determined Trump to be a threat, but we were unable to find any equivalent of the Economist Intelligence Unit report. (Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said that \"analysts\" was intended to refer to the multiple analysts within the Economist Intelligence Unit who came up with the ratings.) But we did find another major economic report that painted a grim picture of what could happen to the economy if Trump wins. On June 17, Moody\u2019s Analytics, an economic research and data-services firm, published its projections of what could happen to the economy under Trump-backed policies on taxes, government spending, immigration and international trade. (We fact-checkedthe political background of one of the Moody's authors in another report.) \"Four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic proposals can be reached,\" the Moody\u2019s team wrote. \"One, they will result in a less global U.S. economy; two, they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; three, they will largely benefit very high-income households; and four, they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment.\" Our ruling Clinton said, \"Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism.\" The analysts at one firm, the Economist Intelligence Unit, have declared the possibility of Trump\u2019s election to be the third-greatest global risk in its current rankings, a risk level that has only grown since the firm began including Trump in its rankings in March. And Clinton has accurately noted that the risk factor given to a Trump presidency is higher than the rating for Islamic terrorism on the firm\u2019s list.

        "doc": "Crossroads GPS, the conservative political advocacy group created by Karl Rove, is one of the top spenders among the third-party organizations targeting Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in his re-election battle with Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.A spin-off of the group American Crossroads, it has spent money most visibly on television ads attacking Brown's record.Among them is \"Doing,\" a 30-second spot whose several claims include the assertion that Brown voted \"for the 1.17 trillion dollar health care law that adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers.\"PolitiFact Ohio wondered particularly about a tax aimed at manufacturing. We asked Crossroads how it supports its cost and tax claim.Crossroads pointed to a July report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The report says that the insurance coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act -- the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare -- contains added costs of $1.17 trillion from 2012 to 2022, confirming the figure in the ad.The cost figures only paint part of the picture, however.The CBO report, and the staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that the cost figures \"do not include the budgetary impact of other provisions of the ACA, which in the aggregate reduce budget deficits.\"When assessing the overall cost of the health care law, the CBO said it could actually reduce budget deficits, because of its provisions that reduce net outlays and because of provisions that increase federal revenues. Those offset the added costs, and then some.One of those provisions is a 2.3-percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices.Crossroads GPS cites that as the \"new tax on Ohio manufacturers,\" and notes that the Joint Committee on Taxation says it will generate $20 billion in revenue by 2020.The tax does not apply to devices made for export, or to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids or other medical device \"generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use,\" the law states.It applies to imported devices as well as those made domestically.In responding to our query, Crossroads GPS also pointed to a 2011 study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed. It said that the excise tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, leading to the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs.An analysis by the research service Bloomberg Government, however, found that the trade group's study \"is not credible.\" Bloomberg concluded that its assumptions conflict with economic research, overstate companies\u2019 incentives to move jobs offshore, and ignore the positive effect of new demand created by the healthcare law.Crossroads GPS also cited an article in the Columbus Dispatch, \"Medical-device makers fight tax,\" to show the tax's negative effects on jobs.But the same article notes that AdvaMed and industry officials \"could not cite an example in Ohio of a company that has cut jobs or put growth plans on hold in anticipation of the tax.\"Where does that leave us?The ad's statement is partially accurate. The Crossroads ad puts an accurate figure on the 10-year net cost of the healthcare law.But the claim leaves out several important details.While there is a federal cost generated by the insurance requirements, overall the law would reduce federal deficits, according to the same reports that Crossroads cites.The law does include an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Its impact is arguable. Dissenters say it could cost jobs and force business overseas.But portraying it broadly as \"a new tax on Ohio manufacturers\" over bills the scope of the tax.In Ohio, Crossroads said, about 20,000 workers are employed by makers of medical devices and equipment. Those jobs amout to about 3 percent of the more than 660,000 workers in Ohio that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says are employed in manufacturing.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.",

        "doc": "On Nov. 12, 2020, an image graphic supposedly containing a statement from U.S. first lady Melania Trump concerning her \u201cfinal Christmas\u201d in the White House started to circulate on social media. The statement came as a surprise to some, since her husband, U.S. President Donald Trump, had not acknowledged President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory and had filed lawsuits contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. Did the first lady really concede defeat as Trump continued to contest the election results? No, this is not an official statement from the White House or Melania Trump. The above-displayed image comes from the website whitehouse.gov1.info. While this website contains information pertaining to White House events (such as Christmas decorations or the Easter Egg Roll), it is not an official government website. When this website writes \u201c2020 marks the final holiday season for the Trump White House,\u201d they do so to acknowledge that Biden is the projected winner of the 2020 election and that the Trump family is expected to leave the White House on Jan. 20, 2021. This is not, however, an official White House statement. Shortly after images from this page went viral, whitehouse.gov1.info added a brief disclaimer at the top of their holiday page: \u201cNote to Readers: Joe Biden won the election which makes this the final holiday season for the Trump White House. This is not the official White House website as noted in the footer below.\u201d As of this writing on Nov. 13, 2020, Melania Trump has not acknowledged the results of the 2020 election and has not reached out to incoming first lady Jill Biden about transitioning to the White House. CNN writes: First lady Melania Trump, much like her husband, is operating as though he didn\u2019t lose last week\u2019s election: She has yet to reach out to first lady-elect Jill Biden, a source familiar told CNN on Tuesday. On this day four years ago, Melania Trump had tea at the White House and a tour of the executive residence, at the invitation of then-first lady Michelle Obama, as is customary. But this time around, any movement towards a transition of the East Wing and the Executive Residence has not begun. Instead, another source with knowledge of Melania Trump\u2019s daily schedule said there is very little in the way of change taking place at all, and most of the focus of the first lady\u2019s office remains on day-to-day meetings and upcoming holiday planning. The president will not leave the White House until Jan. 20, 2021, which means that Melania Trump will have one final Christmas in the White House. Although there have been reports that the holiday decorations will go up as normal, the first lady has previously said that this tradition \u2014 decorating the White House for Christmas \u2014 is not her favorite part about being first lady. In October 2020, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former top aide for the first lady, released a recording of Melania saying \u201cwho gives a fuck about Christmas stuff.\u201d The New York Times writes: Melania Trump, the first lady, delivered a profanity-laced rant about White House Christmas decorations and mocked the plight of migrant children who were separated from their parents at the border, during a 2018 conversation secretly taped by her former aide and close confidante. \u201cI\u2019m working like a \u2014 my ass off at Christmas stuff,\u201d Mrs. Trump laments to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who served as a top aide in the East Wing and has just published a tell-all book, \u201cMelania and Me.\u201d Mrs. Trump continues, \u201cYou know, who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff and decoration?\u201d",

That video, which was presented as if it were the \u201ccoldest moment in sport\u201d history, quickly racked up nearly 1 million views.

The video is actually several years old. It first started circulating in 2019 after Woods hit a 19-foot putt to win a singles match at the Presidents Cup. In the genuine video, Woods watches his ball as it makes its way across the green and toward the cup. It isn\u2019t until the very last second that he raises his head and acknowledges his victory. Here\u2019s the original clip: Woods\u2019 genuine celebration caused some conversation online, as he does lift his head a moment or two before the ball actually goes in. After the match, Woods said: \u201cWell, when it was about probably like six feet out \u2014 the match was over. I might have taken the hat off a little bit early, but it was over.\u201d PuttOut Golf, a company that makes various golf aids, played on this theme and created the viral video that exaggerated Woods\u2019 confidence.

        "claim": "\"(Fritz) Kaegi managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons.\"",
        "doc": "In a recent cable TV ad, Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios accused his Democratic primary opponent, Fritz Kaegi, of profiting from the private prison industry during his tenure as an investment analyst at Columbia Wanger Asset Management. \"Kaegi personally managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons,\" the ad stated. \"Prisons where women refused food to protest abusive guards, immigrant children as young as 5 were held and detainees died suspiciously. But Kaegi only saw profits.\" Berrios also aired a similarly worded radio ad. According to a new report from Comcast Joe Berrios is spending $114K on cable ads to air between tomorrow and the end of December. The for-profit prison industry has long been the focus of animus for Democrats nationally, and the very concept of private prisons has been a source of controversy generally, so connecting Kaegi to it could score political points for Berrios. Investment funds like those managed by Kaegi contain dozens of stocks covering a diverse array of industries. We took a look to see if private prisons were in the portfolio on Kaegi\u2019s watch. Kaegi spent 13 years as an investment manager at Columbia Wanger Asset Management, where he oversaw the Columbia Acorn Fund with two other analysts. He gave up management duties of the fund and left Columbia Wanger on March 13 to begin his campaign. Our first call was to the Berrios campaign to find out the basis for the ad\u2019s allegation. Campaign spokeswoman Monica Trevino provided a quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing from March 31 that showed the Columbia Acorn Fund contained 926,513 shares in CoreCivic, a Nashville-based company that manages 91 prisons and related facilities across the country. The shares are valued at $29,111,038, according to the filing. Trevino also sent an amendment to the Columbia Acorn prospectus dated March 13 that showed Kaegi\u2019s oversight of the fund would end on March 14. Because the quarterly report includes time when Kaegi was one of three managers of the fund, he\u2019s connected to the CoreCivic investment, Trevino said. \"Kaegi has not (provided) any definitive evidence that when the investment was made he wasn\u2019t there,\" Trevino said in an email. Interestingly, Kaegi provided the same March 13 document in defending himself. He said it shows he was not active in the fund\u2019s management after that date and that CoreCivic and other stocks were added to the portfolio between March 14 and March 31. Kaegi explained he ran the fund with two other managers \u2014 lead portfolio manager Matthew A. Litfin and co-manager P. Zachary Egan \u2014 and no investments were made without agreement from all three. \"If one person was against buying, you didn\u2019t buy,\" Kaegi said. Kaegi consistently had blocked investment in CoreCivic and a few other stocks, but that ended when he stepped down as manager on March 13, he said. Neither Litfin nor Egan responded to our requests for comment. \"I always thought these were bad companies\" that \"try to dress themselves up as real estate companies,\" said Kaegi, adding that he believes changing attitudes on mass incarceration make private prison stocks a risky investment. That\u2019s in addition to ethical concerns over privatizing correctional facilities, he said. In a press release issued shortly after Berrios\u2019 ad appeared, Kaegi\u2019s campaign provided links to all of the fund\u2019s quarterly reports from 2015 and 2016, none of which show CoreCivic (or Corrections Corporation of America, as it previously had been known) among its holdings. Kaegi also produced a summary from Feb. 28, 2017 \u2014 just two weeks before his management ended \u2014 that does not show CoreCivic among Columbia Acorn Fund\u2019s holdings. \"This is just about the most controversial stock you can imagine,\" Kaegi said. \"Why on earth would I do that when I\u2019m about to step down to run for this office?\" A comparison of the Feb. 28 summary and the March 31 quarterly report shows several stocks \u2014 Bioverativ, Blackline, Brunswick Corp., Copart, CoreCivic, Credit Acceptance Corp., Pool Corp., Q2, Tractor Supply and TransUnion \u2014 that were added after Feb. 28. Kaegi campaign spokesman DeRondal Bevly said TransUnion was the only stock that was added while Kaegi still managed the fund. Berrios said his primary challenger \"managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons.\" Columbia Acorn Fund, of which Fritz Kaegi was one of three managers, reported $29.1 million in stock of the private prison operator CoreCivic on its March 31, 2017, quarterly report. But Kaegi\u2019s active management of the fund ended March 13, as documented in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kaegi said the CoreCivic investment came after he was gone, and points to two years of quarterly reports and a Feb. 28 holdings summary to back his point. We were unable to confirm from Kaegi\u2019s co-managers, but a scenario in which Kaegi during his final two weeks as a fund manager decides to invest in a controversial private prison stock as a last act before challenging an opponent in a Democratic primary in Cook County borders on absurd. Berrios\u2019 statement contains an element of truth \u2014 the quarterly report on March 31 shows a $29.1 million investment in CoreCivic. But it ignores the critical fact that Kaegi didn\u2019t manage the fund as of March 14 and that as recently Feb. 28 CoreCivic was not part of the portfolio. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "doc": "Nigerians are set to vote for a new president on 25 February 2023 as the second and final term of current president Muhammadu Buhari comes to a close. The Candidates, a series of live televised town hall meetings, allowed five presidential hopefuls to state their case and answer questions. Notably missing were leading candidates Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu. Africa Check and our partners in the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time, on social media. Here is a shorter and more contextual report on that work. Campaigns are in full gear as Nigeria's 2023 presidential election comes steadily into view. The presidential election \u2013 and elections for the national assembly \u2013 is set for 25 February . And in a bid to win voters, the major presidential candidates and their deputies have been appearing on The Candidates , a series of town hall meetings aired on live TV. The series began on 17 November with Adewole Adebayo, the Social Democratic Party candidate. Other candidates in the series are Omoyele Sowore of the African Action Congress , Rabiu Kwankwanso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party and Peter Obi of the Labour Party . Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party skipped the town halls. He was replaced with Kola Abiola of the Peoples Redemption Party . Also notably absent was Bola Tinubu of the governing All Progressives Congress . Each candidate had two hours to outline their plans and respond to questions from the moderator, Kadaria Ahmed . Questions were also taken from the audience in the studio and online. We and the rest of the Nigerian Fact-checkers' Coalition fact-checked each of the five sessions live and posted a summary of our findings on social media. This is a more contextual report of those findings. To keep things shorter, we have left out some claims that were straightforward and correct. They include claims about Nigeria's life expectancy and whether agriculture employs the most labour in the country. Candidate: Adewole Adebayo , Social Democratic Party (SDP) Adebayo argued that the administration of outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari had mismanaged the economy, including its vital crude oil and natural gas resources. He claimed that as much as 80% of Nigeria's crude oil was being stolen. The theft of the country's main export has been widely reported . But are as many as eight of every 10 barrels of oil produced in Nigeria stolen? The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission regulates oil and gas production. As part of this, it tracks how much oil is produced. In June 2022, agency chief executive Gbenga Komolafe was quoted saying that in the first three months of the year, oil theft had been estimated at a daily average of 120,000 barrels. In that period, Nigeria's central bank recorded production at more than 1.2 million barrels every day \u2013 an average of 1.4 million in January, 1.26 million in February and 1.24 million in March. The estimated figure of 120,000 barrels is less than 10% of oil produced. Others have given higher estimates of up to 400,000 barrels a day , but this still does not translate to 80% of the country's output. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Adebayo said the Central Bank of Nigeria 's performance has been poor and included the mismanagement of monetary policy. As a solution, he pledged to pick an economist \u2013 for \"the first time in a long time\" \u2013 as the bank's governor. Nigeria has had four central bank governors since its return to multiparty democracy in 1999. Two of them were economists, one appointed as recently as 2014. Joseph Sanusi , in office from 1999 to 2004, is an accountant. He studied accounting and has experience in capital markets and banking. Chukwuma Soludo , the governor from 2004 to 2009, is a professor of economics. He trained at institutions such the Brookings Institution in the US and the University of Cambridge in the UK. Soludo's successor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi , has a bachelor's degree in economics and taught economics at Ahmadu Bello University before going into banking. He was governor from 2009 to 2014. The current bank governor, Godwin Emefiele , has been in office since 2014. He studied banking and finance and taught finance and insurance at two Nigerian universities before beginning his banking career. But is it important that the bank be led by an economist? Yes, it is important for the governor of the central bank to be an economist, we were told by Ifuero Osamwonyi, a professor of finance at the University of Benin in southern Nigeria. \"The governor of CBN needs to be experienced in macroeconomic modelling. The person needs to be grounded in matters of monetary policy and the macroeconomics of the country and the world,\" he said. Macroeconomics is concerned with factors that affect the whole economy, such as unemployment, inflation and economic growth. In Osamwonyi's view, Soludo has been the most qualified of the bank's governors so far, due to his work in macroeconomics before his time in office. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Candidate: Omoyele Sowore , African Action Congress (AAC) Sowore, an activist and media entrepreneur, is a well-known critic of the government . He attributed Nigeria's electricity challenge to a succession of governments. He then repeated a claim that has been making the rounds for more than a decade \u2013 that the Nigerian government has spent US$16 billion on electricity and still failed to solve the problem. The claim is often made in reference to the spending of president Olusegun Obasanjo's administration on what were known as the National Independent Power Projects during its term from 1999 to 2007. Obasanjo governed under the Peoples Democratic Party, which is hoping to succeed the APC. But is the claim correct? Despite being alluded to several times by APC leaders and Buhari officials, there are still no publicly available official records that support this. A 2017 report by the Lagos-based nonprofit Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project found the Obasanjo administration spent $10 billion and not $16 billion on the power projects. A year later Obasanjo shared the findings of a 2007 probe by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission . This found far lower spending on the projects: about N1.23 trillion (US$9.64 billion) . But only about N360.7 billion ($2.8 billion at the official exchange rate of N127.5 to $1 in May 2007) had been paid out when Obasanjo left office. And the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (formerly the National Electric Power Authority), which oversaw the projects, received N273.65 billion from 1999 to 2007. That comes to $2.15 billion, using the average 2007 exchange rate. This still does not add up to the $16 billion claimed. And in a more recent probe, in 2019, the anti-graft watchdog again did not find evidence of this level of spending. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Sowore said Nigeria's insecurity problem could not be solved without investments in social security or policies that aim to cushion individuals and households against possible hardships. China had more guns than Nigeria but it resolved its security challenges by investing a lot in social security, he said. A 2018 survey estimated that there were 6.2 million firearms in the hands of civilians in Nigeria, or 3.21 firearms per 100 people. The research found civilians in China held 49.7 million firearms, or 3.58 firearms per 100 people . The data shows that China has more guns, both in absolute numbers and per population, in the hands of civilians than Nigeria. What about illegal firearms? It is difficult to estimate how many illegal weapons are in the hands of Nigerian civilians, Sam Smah, a professor of criminology and criminal justice administration at the National Open University of Nigeria in Abuja, told Africa Check. \"The estimate I am working with is about 10 million illegal firearms in Nigeria. The majority of the illegal firearms circulating in West Africa are in Nigeria. I know that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Development Programme and a West African agency have done surveys on this,\" he said. Smah said conflicts in the Sahel and the \"collapse of security\" in some parts of northern Nigeria had led to high traffic in illegal weapons, which were almost impossible to track. \"Recently, I heard president Buhari say that some of the firearms from the war in Ukraine are being diverted to Nigeria.\" A 2021 presentation by UNODC says it is estimated that 70% of over 10 million illegal weapons in circulation in West Africa are in Nigeria. But it  notes that there is little to no data to prove this. \u2013 Allwell Okpi The media have reported that president Buhari, first elected in 2015, tried to meet hi s campaign promise \"to look at the presidential air fleet with a view to cutting down on waste\". Two planes from the fleet were put up for sale in 2016 . In September 2020 the presidenc y reportedly tried to sell another aircraft . But there is no evidence any of the sales have gone through . The cost of maintaining the fleet has reportedly risen by over 120% in the past eight years. This does not mean new planes were added. We found no evidence that the Buhari administration has added any new planes to the presidential fleet. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Candidate: Rabiu Kwankwaso , New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) Rabiu Kwankwaso was governor of the northwestern Nigerian state of Kano from 1999 to 2003. He returned in 2011 for another term, which ended in 2015. He has repeatedly claimed he did not borrow money to run his administration during both terms as governor. But available evidence does not support the claim. The national media reported that Kwankwaso borrowed N4.1 billion from pension funds to build th e Bandirawo, Amana and Kwankwasiya housing estates , a \"mega city\" project that he hoped to leave as a legacy. Data from the country's Debt Management Office (DMO) show that Kano state's domestic debt, owed to Nigerian banks, increased by nearly N60 billion from 2011 to 2015. Kwankwaso's second term began on 29 May 2011. The DMO later published a report that showed Kano's domestic debt was N5.87 billion at the end of December 2011. By the end of December 2015, it had jumped to N65 billion . Kwankwaso left office on 29 May 2015. But since the DMO only publishes state-level data at the end of the year, we were not able to establish the exact debt at his departure. Data from the agency does show that the state's external debt, owed to other countries or multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, dropped slightly during the period . External debt was $63.9 million on 30 June 2011. It dropped to $59.8 million on 30 June 2015 . \u2013 Allwell Okpi Kwankwaso was Kano governor from 1999 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2015. Data from the debt office shows the state owed $59.8 million to external creditors as of 30 June 2015 \u2013 a month after he left the office. The office didn't publish data for domestic debt in June 2015. But at the end of that year, Kano's domestic debt was N65 billion . Kwankwaso's successor, Umar Ganduje, told journalists two days after he became governor that there was nothing wrong with Kwankwaso's administration leaving the state with over N300 billion in debt . We could not find independent data on Kano's debt profile when Kwankwaso left office in 2003. Publicly available official data only goes back to 2006. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Kwankwaso said that if he were elected, he would ensure the national budget for education would be more than what the country currently spends, as he had done when he was governor of Kano state. He referred to a widely quoted \"25% recommendation\" for education funding he said was by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Education (Unesco). There is no evidence the UN agency has such a recommendation. In 2017, Nigeria's education minister Adamu Adamu debunked a similar claim of a \"26% Unesco recommendation\". He said Unesco officials had confirmed the agency has not recommended such a benchmark. The only recommendation we found is that of a 2015 global education monitoring report commissioned by Unesco. The report proposed that governments should spend 4% to 6% of their gross national product, or 15% to 20% of their national budget, on education. But Unesco said it did not represent its opinion. Kwankwaso set aside less than 25% of Kano's budget for education Budget data on the Kano state website dates back only to 2016. But we found other documents online that show how much was budgeted for education in Kano under Kwankwaso's administration. In his 2012 budget speech to the state assembly, Kwankwaso proposed a total budget of N210.38 billion . \"Mr Speaker, we are determined to address the apparent collapse of the education sector. We thus plan to spend a total of N35 billion on education,\" he was quoted as saying . The N35 billion was 16.6% of the total budget. N221.62 billion was eventually approved , with education getting a total of N35.5 billion, or 15.9% . The 2015 budget, the last of Kwankwaso's Kano governorship, allocated N29.55 billion to the education ministry and N18.83 billion to the higher education ministry.  That meant the total education budget was N48.38 billion. The N48.38 billion amounted to 23% of Kano's total budget of N210 billion in 2015. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Candidate: Peter Obi , Labour Party Responding to a question on how he would reduce the budget deficit if elected, Peter Obi gave the country's 2021 budget as N21 trillion, with a N11 trillion shortfall. Obi is running on the Labour Party ticket. A deficit is the difference between what a government earns and what it spends. Budget office documents show N13.6 trillion was budgeted for the 2021 budget, and not N21 trillion. The budget deficit for that year was also lower, at N5.6 trillion . Obi's claim about a N11 trillion deficit would have been correct if he was referring to the 2023 budget . \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Expressing his position on the country's several different exchange rates , Obi said the naira's weakness against other currencies should be tackled. He linked this fragility to the country's low reserves. He then compared Nigeria's earnings from its exports to those of the Middle Eastern country of Israel . He claimed that Israel's exports in 2021 were worth $59.8 billion. According to the World Bank, Israel's export earnings in 2021 were far more, at $143 billion . Nigeria's earnings from export in 2019, the year for which the bank last has data, was $63.73 billion . Israel's exports include precious metals and stones, electrical and mechanical machinery, as well as appliances and chemicals. Obi also gave the value of the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam 's exports as being over $350 billion, even though the country has only a fraction of Nigeria's population. Official data shows the country exported $336.31 billion in 2021. Obi's overall argument about Nigeria's need to strengthen exports was made, but he used incorrect figures. Nigeria exports mainly raw materials Nigeria's industries were weak and on their deathbeds, Abayomi Adebayo, a professor of labour and development economics at the Obafemi Awolowo University in the southwestern Nigerian state of Osun, told Africa Check. Adebayo said Nigeria mainly exported raw materials, and earnings from these tended to be lower. \"We should work on how to process what we export to earn more. Refine crude oil for internal use and export to other countries. We must also begin to produce things internally. We are weak in the production of anything. This must change.\" \u2013 Motunrayo Joel The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission by law regulates the country's electricity supply. According to the commission, Nigeria had a total installed capacity of 10,396 megawatts (MW ) in 2017, with available capacity being 6,056 MW. Installed capacity is the maximum theoretical electricity output when power generation operates at 100%. Effective capacity, on the other hand, is the expected output when operating constraints are factored in. In 2018 installed capacity was 12,522MW . In 2022, vice president Yemi Osinbaj o said the country's installed capacity was more than 18,000 MW. We have asked the commission for official data. Without their response, we can for the time being only rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi did not give a timeframe for when oil was 50% of the Nigerian government's revenue . The most recent data on this is from the central bank data , for the second quarter of 2022 \u2013 the months of April, May and June. This shows that non-oil income accounted for 59.5% of revenue, while revenue from oil was 40.5% , a pattern carried over from the previous quarter . \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi added that oil accounts for 80% of the country's foreign exchange revenue. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a monetary authority in foreign currency. They include banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other foreign government securities. According to National Bureau of Statistics data , crude oil accounted for 78.51% of the country's total exports in the third quarter \u2013 July, August and September \u2013 of 2022. 'We need to boost our reserves' The pressure on reserves is enormous, with more going out than coming in. That's what Dr Muda Yusuf , the former director general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry , told Africa Check. He gave \"demand side\" examples of how Nigeria could boost its reserves. They include reducing the import of petroleum products, reviewing the country's industrialisation strategy to make it less dependent on raw material imports, and securing and developing agriculture to cut food imports. On the \"supply side\", Yusuf highlighted the challenge of oil theft, which meant the country was not meeting its targets. The country's foreign exchange policy should also \"be market driven to improve foreign exchange liquidity in the economy\", he said. He added that Nigeria should grow its non-oil exports to add to increased forex inflows. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi claimed that Britain has an unwritten constitution. Is this true? Robert Blackburn, a professor of constitutional law at King's College London , explains this in a 2015 article for the country's national library. It's titled: \" Britain's unwritten constitution \". \"From a comparative perspective, we have what is known as an 'unwritten constitution', although some prefer to describe it as 'uncodified' on the basis that many of our laws of a constitutional nature are in fact written down in Acts of Parliament or law reports of court judgments,\" the article reads. A codified constitution is written down clearly in a specific document, called \"the constitution\" of a country. \"This aspect of the British constitution, its unwritten nature, is its most distinguishing characteristic,\" Blackburn writes. \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Obi was governor of the southeastern state of Anambra over three stints spanning 2006 to 2014. He claimed that when he left office, the share of poor people in Anambra was a low 11.2%. We traced this data to a 2017 paper on poverty by the University of Oxford in the UK. This used several indicators to work out what is known as the multidimensional poverty index . The index reflects the share of possible deprivations that poor people experience. It gives the results as a range, with zero being no poverty and one the highest deprivation. In addition to a national figure, the research found that the share of poor people in Lagos state, the economic hub, was 8.5% , followed by Osun (10.9%) and then Anambra (11.2%). What does more recent data suggest? The 2022 Nigeria Multidimensional Poverty Index survey from Nigeria's national statistics office has a more recent estimate. According to the survey, 133 million Nigerians are multidimensionally poor, with the states of Sokoto, Bayelsa, Gombe, Jigawa and Plateau the poorest. Sokoto leads with 90.5% followed by Bayelsa (88.5%), Gombe (86.2%), Jigawa (84.3%), and Plateau (84%). The least poor states are Ondo (27.2%), Lagos (29.4%), Abia (29.8%), Edo (31%), and Anambra (32.1%). \u2013 Motunrayo Joel Candidate: Kola Abiola , Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) The most recent economic data from the Nigeria statistics bureau that differentiates between the formal and informal sectors is from 2015. It gives the share of the informal sector as 41.43% . In 2017, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the informal sector contributed as much as 65% to Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) - a commonly used measure of an economy's size. A 2021 World Bank database used two methods to estimate Nigeria's informal economy as between 48.2% and 56.2% of the official 2018 GDP. Developing economies 'have bigger informal economies' It was normal for developing economies like Nigeria to have a large informal sector, Oluranti Olurinola, a professor of economics at Covenant University, Ota in southwest Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"The size of the informal sector is usually inversely proportional to development. So, you see that it is developing and emerging nations that have the largest informal sectors,\" Olurinola said. More developed countries, like the OECD countries, have small informal economies because a lot of things are well-structured.\" The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or OECD is an economic grouping of 38 mainly European countries. \u2013 Allwell Okpi Employment in the informal sector may be even more than 84%, Olunrinola said. \"Different studies in different parts of the country show that over 80% of employment is in the informal sector. I recently reviewed one of such studies done by the Nigeria Institute of Social and Economic Research . I am aware it will be published soon,\" he said. In 2021, the World Bank published a paper titled \" The Long Shadow of Informality: Challenges and Policies \". It found that 80.4 % of employment in Nigeria is in the informal sector. Neither the National Bureau of Statistics nor the federal ministry of labour and employment has data on employment in the informal sector. Based on what data is available we rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Allwell Okpi",

        "claim": "Donald Trump criticized President Barack Obama during the 2013 government shutdown for failing to \"lead,\" \"get everyone in a room,\" and \"make a deal.\"",
        "doc": "In October 2013, during the administration of President Barack Obama, the United States government underwent a budget impasse that led to a shutdown, resulting in most routine government operations being curtailed for the first seventeen days of the month. The shutdown occurred because neither legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year 2014 nor a continuing resolution for interim appropriations was approved in time, largely due to Republican attempts to tie government funding to resolutions delaying or defunding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d). The U.S. government experienced another shutdown in January 2018, during the administration of President Donald Trump. Republicans blamed Democrats for creating the budget impasse by holding out on fixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, while Democrats blamed Republicans for a failure to govern and President Trump for reneging on earlier agreements: Ever since Trump announced in September that he would end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on March 5 unless Congress acted to extend it, Democrats in the House and Senate have been clamoring for a permanent legislative fix to protect the young immigrants known as Dreamers. Prospects for a quick agreement brightened briefly in September after Trump appeared to sign off on a framework with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer; that plan would have traded the Dream Act for additional security at the border. But under pressure from immigration hard-liners, Trump backed away and added a whole new set of demands for a DACA deal, including funding for his border wall and significant changes to the legal immigration system. Pelosi promised immigration activists that Democrats would not leave for the year without addressing DACA, but Senate Democrats agreed just before Christmas to punt the fight to January. With the funding deadline approaching and no immigration agreement in sight, Democrats in both the House and Senate decided to make a stand. Democrats in turn blamed Republicans and Trump for a basic failure to govern, noting that this shutdown is the first in history to occur when a single party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. And they blamed Trump for repeatedly backing out of agreements that would have resolved the dispute. Donald Trump (then a private citizen) was highly critical of President Obama in over the 2013 government shutdown, and President Trump\u2019s critics gleefully turned the table on him in January 2018 by casting his own words back at him: \"A shutdown falls on the President's lack of leadership. He can't even control his party and get people together in a room. A shutdown means the President is weak.\" ~Donald Trump, 2013#TrumpShutdown \u2014 US Rep Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 20, 2018 We couldn\u2019t find an exact match for the words quoted above, which don\u2019t appear in any tweet posted by Donald Trump in 2013; they are more likely a paraphrase or summary of one or more comments Trump made during several television appearances in the latter part of 2013. For example, speaking by telephone to the hosts of Fox & Friends on 20 September 2013, Trump chided President Obama for failing to \u201cget everybody in a room\u201d and creating a \u201csituation [that\u2019s] very embarrassing worldwide\u201d: \u201cProblems start from the top, and they have to get solved from the top, and the President\u2019s the leader, and he\u2019s got to get everybody in a room, and he\u2019s got to lead. And he doesn\u2019t do that, he doesn\u2019t like doing that, that\u2019s not his strength. And that\u2019s why you have this horrible situation going on in Washington. It\u2019s a very, very bad thing and it\u2019s very embarrassing worldwide.\u201d And during an October 2013 interview with Fox News host Greta van Susteren, Trump again took President Obama to task for failing to be a \u201cdealmaker\u201d: \u201cWell, very simply, you have to get everybody in a room. You have to be a leader. The president has to lead. He\u2019s got to get [the Speaker of the House] and everybody else in a room, and they have to make a deal. You have to be nice, and be angry, and be wild, and cajole, and do all sorts of things. But you have to get a deal. Unfortunately, [the president] has never been a dealmaker. That wasn\u2019t his expertise before he went into politics. And it\u2019s obviously not his expertise now. But you have to get the people in the room, and you have to get a deal that\u2019s good for everybody and good for the country.\u201d #TBT to when Trump lectured President Obama about how to negotiate a deal to prevent a government shutdown, saying \u201cthe president has to lead.\u201d \u201cYou have to get everybody in a room\u201d to get a deal because it\u2019s \u201cgood for the country.\u201d pic.twitter.com/sdtcWRrWzz \u2014 DNC Press (@dncpress) January 18, 2018 And, of course, as Donald Trump noted in the immediate aftermath of the 2013 government shutdown: Leadership: Whatever happens, you\u2019re responsible. If it doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019re responsible. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2013 Four and half years later, Donald Trump found himself on the receiving end of that sentiment, in spades: Trump just made history, many ways. First president to preside over a govt shutdown while his party controls the House, Senate and White House AND first president to preside over a shutdown on the first anniversary of his inauguration AND earliest shutdown ever in a presidency. \u2014 Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) January 20, 2018 ",

        "claim": "Frozen wind turbines played a major role in Texas power outages as unusually harsh winter storms covered the region in snow and ice in February 2021.",
        "doc": "Texas sustained widespread power failures in mid-February 2021, after a major and rare winter storm resulted in heavy snow, ice, and extremely low temperatures across the state. And the region\u2019s power generating infrastructure was not prepared. On Feb. 15, 2021, 2 million households across Texas lost power, and found themselves without any heat. The storm shut down most of the state, icing over roads, and U.S. President Joe Biden declared a federal emergency across the state. After water treatment plants sustained power outages, residents of Forth Worth received an official order to boil their water, while the city of Kyle said that it was close to running out of water. Conservatives immediately blamed the state\u2019s reliance on renewable energy resources, particularly wind power, citing frozen wind turbines as the biggest reason why so much of the power had failed. Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson laid the main blame on wind turbines, saying: \u201cThe windmills froze, so the power grid failed. Millions of Texans woke up Monday morning having to boil their water because with no electricity, it couldn\u2019t be purified,\u201d and \u201cThe windmills failed like the silly fashion accessories they are, and people in Texas died.\u201d Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw tweeted that the failure of wind turbines was a major factor in the power outages: With electricity blackouts across Texas, many are wondering: what happened? How does the energy capital of the United States run out of power? Here\u2019s what happened. THREAD \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) February 16, 2021 #1 \u2013 Frozen Wind Turbines: West Texas, where most of the wind energy is focused, had wind turbines that had to be de-iced. The little energy that power regulators planned on wind to supply was now gone. \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) February 16, 2021 This is what happens when you force the grid to rely in part on wind as a power source. When weather conditions get bad as they did this week, intermittent renewable energy like wind isn\u2019t there when you need it.https://t.co/glCm3K0xyp \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) February 16, 2021 Crenshaw cited low supplies of natural gas as another reason and added, \u201cHad our grid been more reliant on the wind turbines that froze, the outages would have been much worse.\u201d He continued with, \u201cThis raises serious concerns about the reliability of renewable-reliant power grids during extreme weather. It also raises serious concerns about the push to decommission baseload power sources like natural gas, which are more reliable than wind and are critical right now to keeping the lights on in Texas.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s headline, \u201cHalf of Texas Wind Turbines Freeze, Hurting Electricity Output,\u201d while technically accurate, did not show the full picture. Half of the wind turbines did go offline, but power loss from that source was a mere fraction compared to the losses from natural gas, coal, and nuclear sources. In a statement to Bloomberg, Dan Woodfin, senior director for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state\u2019s power grid, said that while ice forced some turbines to shut down just as a brutal cold wave drove record electricity demand, that was the least significant factor in the blackouts. Woodfin also told Bloomberg that the main factors behind the power failures were frozen instruments at natural gas, coal, and nuclear facilities, as well as limited supplies of natural gas. An official with ERCOT also said on Feb. 16 that 16 gigawatts of renewable energy generation, mostly wind generation, were offline. In contrast, 30 gigawatts had been lost from thermal sources, including gas, coal and nuclear energy. By the next day that number had changed to 28 gigawatts of power from thermal sources and 18 gigawatts from renewable sources. Wind power is a significant energy source for the state, but the supply tends to ebb in winter months. It accounts for only 25% of total power generation that time of the year. Frozen turbines were still an issue for the state, because it was unpreparedfor the winter ice and snow. Turbines can be \u201cwinterized,\u201d or made snow-ready, given that wind turbines have been operating in regions like Antarctica. Experts pointed out that many of Texas\u2019 power generators, including natural gas plants and wind turbines, have not made the necessary upgrades to be ready for such conditions. \u201c[\u2026] the winterization we were doing was working, but this weather was more extreme than [past storms],\u201d Woodfin said. \u201cThe loss of generation during the morning of Monday, after midnight, was really the part that made this a more extreme event than we had planned.\u201d Given that wind turbines were not the main culprit in the blackouts, but were certainly a fraction of the problem, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d",

        "doc": "A notice on Facebook warns that due to the federal government shutdown, food stamps will no longer be available for March. \"March 2019 and on-going food benefits WILL NOT be available until further notice. Clients are encouraged to use their food benefits as soon as possible in case SNAP benefits are unavailable in March,\" says the Jan. 14 post. This post, which was shared 5,000 times within two days, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, there is some truth to part of the statement, although the sentence that says food stamps \"will not be available\" in March is premature. The post included phone numbers for the Food Bank of Delaware. That organization led us to find the same information on a flyer, which directs people to a website for Delaware\u2019s Health and Social Services agency. A spokeswoman for the state agency pointed PolitiFact to a news release, which made no predictions about benefits in March. \"Our hope is to be back on the regular schedule beginning in March,\" it states. The flyer correctly states that SNAP recipients will receive benefits for February in January, as announced by the federal government last week. Advocates are concerned that recipients may not realize what is happening and spend their February benefits in January, and then run out of food. The federal department hasn\u2019t announced that benefits will be cut off in March if the shutdown continues. While SNAP benefits are considered an entitlement, meaning that anyone who qualifies can receive benefits if he or she applies, the program is historically funded through the annual appropriations process, generally as part of the agriculture bill. Dottie Rosenbaum, an expert on SNAP at the left-leaningCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, told PolitiFact she doesn\u2019t think many states could cover the cost of food stamps in the event the federal government doesn\u2019t fund the program. \"Even if they could, it's not clear how they would get the state appropriation to do so in the middle of the year, and it's not clear whether they would be able to be reimbursed after the fact,\" she said. \"USDA hasn't indicated.\" Elaine Waxman, an expert on food benefits at the Urban Institute, said it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess what will happen. But she thinks it is likely that the federal government will have to find a solution because SNAP benefits are an important part of the food economy, providing benefits to people and making up a key share of retailer revenues. Nationally, about 39 million individuals get SNAP benefits, an average of $123 a month. Generally speaking, the number of food stamp recipients has declined since 2013. In Delaware, more than 136,000 individuals get food stamps, most of them children, seniors and people with disabilities. James P. Ziliak, director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky, said that if SNAP benefits are cut off, \"we will enter largely uncharted territory since the inception of the modern Food Stamp Program in 1977.\" Organizations including the Food Bank of Delaware are preparingfor a potential influx of visitors in the spring. A Facebook post said, \"March 2019 and on-going food benefits WILL NOT be available until further notice. Clients are encouraged to use their food benefits as soon as possible in case SNAP benefits are unavailable in March.\" The first part of that post is premature because it is unknown if SNAP benefits, more commonly referred to as food stamps, will be available in March. All we know is that during the federal government shutdown, food stamps have continued through February. What happens after that is anybody\u2019s guess. We rate this statement Half True. ",

        "doc": "In February 2021, several news outlets reported on an unusual crime story, writing that a woman in Seattle, Washington, had found a substantial quantity of cocaine buried inside a crochet kit she bought from a local thrift store. On Feb. 24, Fox News published an article with the headline \u201cSeattle woman finds 1 kilo of cocaine in crochet kit she bought at thrift shop, police say.\u201d The article stated that: A Seattle woman got more than she bargained for when she bought a crochet kit at a thrift shop and discovered a kilogram of cocaine inside, authorities said. The woman purchased the kit to crochet animal hats around 3 p.m. Sunday in the city\u2019s Greenwood neighborhood, the Seattle Police Department said in a news release. But when the crochet hobbyist opened the kit, she found a suspicious package that was encased in yellow rubber with \u201c100%\u201d written on the outside. The item also gave off an \u201codd odor,\u201d police said. The woman immediately called police, who seized the suspicious package and later confirmed it contained one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of cocaine. Similar articles were published by KCPQ, KOMO, WREG, and The Hill. Those reports were accurate. On Feb. 22, Seattle police described the episode in a news release, as follows: Sunday afternoon, a woman discovered a kilogram of narcotics within a packaged crochet kit in the Greenwood neighborhood. Around 3:00pm, a woman purchased a kit to crochet animal hats at a business within the 6400 block of 8th Avenue Northwest. When she opened the kit, there was a suspicious heavy item encased in yellow rubber giving off an odd odor with 100% written on the outside. The woman immediately called 9-1-1. Officers responded and took possession of the suspicious package. Police later confirmed the substance to be a kilogram of cocaine. The packaged was placed into evidence. That statement erroneously described the store as being located in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle. In fact, the 6400 block of Eighth Avenue Northwest is in the Ballard neighborhood. Police also released the following photograph of the package that contained the cocaine: The Goodwill thrift store effectively confirmed the woman had purchased the crochet kit there, in the following statement, which was provided to The Seattle Times: \u201cThe safety of our customers and employees is our first priority and it is our policy is to keep hazardous, dangerous, or recalled materials away from our stores,\u201d a Goodwill spokesperson said in an email. \u201cWe do our best to identify and remove those items if they are found. Part of our processes is to maintain an up-to-date list of all recalled products and we train employees to identify and spot check for any dangerous items and prevent them from being sold in our stores. \u201cWe strive to comply with the letter and spirit of all regulations on the sale and resale of consumer products and we do not tolerate any known failures to comply with the law. It is also our practice to cooperate fully with local authorities in any investigation.\u201d",

        "claim": "CNN was caught using photographs of the same girl to represent three different refugee crises.",
        "doc": "In December 2016, an image comprising photographs of a little girl being carried by three separate rescue workers began circulating on social media, along with text asserting it documented that CNN had been caught using images of the same girl to illustrate three separate reports of refugee crises in different areas \u2014 and, incredibly, she was garbed in the very same outfit each time: The caption suggested that a major news network (CNN) had falsified their reporting with phony images in order to exaggerate the human toll of violence in three different (unidentified) areas. But simple reverse image searches revealed this rumor to be just more nonsense in the vein of conspiratorial \u201ccrisis actor\u201d claims. The middle photograph in the trio was easy to locate, with dozens of results returned via image searching: According to a contemporaneous report from NBC News, this photograph was taken in the aftermath of the bombing of a funeral in Aleppo, Syria, in August 2016. A related search for the right-hand image revealed that it indeed depicted the same girl, being carried by a rescuer after the same 27 August 2016 bombing in Aleppo: The left-hand image was cropped for the \u201csame refugee girl\u201d meme, but it was also a widely published photograph taken immediately after the August 2016 Aleppo funeral bombing. The original photograph depicted a rescuer carrying the girl along with several other children at the site of the attack: A separate photograph not included above captured the same girl sitting in the back of a van after the Aleppo funeral bombing: So, rather than presenting three images of the same girl (in the same clothing) supposedly being carried by rescuers after three different \u201crefugee crises\u201d in separate times and places, this triptych simply captures one girl being passed around from one rescuer, caretaker, or family member to another in the same disaster zone as part of humanitarian efforts undertaken after the same single bombing event in Syria that left 16 people dead. We found no evidence that CNN ever used any of these photographs to represent anything other than that one event. SIGHTING: In March 2019, we were notified of a variant of the same meme rewritten for a Swedish audience: Translated, the meme reads: \u201cWhen SVT communist channel uses the same girl/in three different refugees crisis pictures/saved by three different men.\u201d",

        "claim": "Says Bernie Sanders opposes \"requiring all children to have a K-12 education.\"",
        "doc": "As the Democratic primary race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont heats up, supporters of each candidate have aggressively gone after the other. We recently looked at a graphic circulating on social media, presumably assembled by backers of Sanders, that contrasted the two candidates\u2019 views on a variety of issues. We found that the descriptions were Mostly True about the candidates\u2019 stances on the death penalty and Mostly True about their positions on trade policy. This time we\u2019ll look at a graphic -- this one presumably put together by Clinton backers -- that compares them on a different set of issues. Here, we\u2019ll check the line in the graphic that says, \"supports requiring all children to have a K-12 education.\" The chart says \"yes\" for Clinton and \"no\" for Sanders. (We asked the Clinton campaign if they wanted to comment, but they declined, saying that they had not produced the graphic.) We had no difficulty tracking down the source of this claim, since the chart cites an article in the liberal magazine Mother Jones. Recently, the magazine has published a few articles reviewing Sanders\u2019 early history in politics and activism. In one, Mother Jones tracked down some of Sanders\u2019 writings from a now-defunct newspaper called the Vermont Freeman. \"Some of his rants bordered on libertarian,\" wrote Mother Jones\u2019 Tim Murphy. In August 1969 in a column titled \"Reflections on a Dying Society,\" Sanders wrote this: It is obvious that in the name of \"public safety\" the State is usurping the rights of free choice in many domains of life. To get (a Federal Housing Authority) loan, one MUST build with specified lumber and materials; to drive an automobile, one MUST have insurance and a car which has no rust going through; to run a farm and sell milk one MUST have a bulk tank; to drive a motorcycle one MUST have a helmet, to cite a few examples. The idea that ALL children MUST attend school until 16 years of age, even if some would rather do other things, is now treated as as given a fact of life as the sunrise. Another Mother Jones article pointed to an article from Seven Days, an alternative weekly in Burlington, Vt., in 1981, shortly after Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington for the first time. The weekly recapped Sanders\u2019 political development and his four statewide races as the nominee of the left-wing Liberty Union Party between 1972 and 1976. \"During his four races for state office as a Liberty Unionist, Sanders called for public takeover of utilities, a guaranteed minimum wage, the abolition of compulsory education, and a radical revision of the nation's tax structure,\" the 1981 article said. In other words, the chart pegs Sanders\u2019 current view on compulsory K-12 education to a column he wrote 46 years ago and to campaigns he ran in the early-to-mid 1970s. That\u2019s pretty weak support. Is there any evidence that Sanders still has the same stance today? His office declined repeated requests to supply an answer, but we found some evidence on our own in Sanders\u2019 legislative record in the Senate. In the previous Congress, Sanders introduced the DIPLOMA Act, which would have authorized grants for disadvantaged youth. The grants would be designed to ensure that \"youth are ready for school,\" \"are engaged and achieving in school,\" and that \"students are ready for postsecondary education at institutions of higher education and 21st century careers.\" He also introduced the Supporting Community Schools Act of 2013, which would give local educational agencies tools to transform under-performing schools. The goals of these efforts would be to improve student achievement, to close achievement gaps between groups of students, and to increase student attendance and graduation rates. (Neither measure advanced through committee.) We couldn\u2019t find any recent comments of Sanders opposing compulsory education. Our ruling A chart on the Internet said that Sanders does not support \"requiring all children to have a K-12 education.\" However, it bases this claim on writings and campaigns from more than 40 years ago, and more recent legislative evidence indicates that Sanders supports a traditional view of K-12 education. We rate the claim False.",

        "doc": "The statement stemmed from a satire website that declares all of its content as fiction. Several social media users have been sharing a post attributed to the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. The post claims that Harris stated that the U.S. government would shut down the veterans' affairs benefits and that the veterans should fend for themselves and find a job. The claim is baseless. The claim originated from a website called 'America's Last Line of Defense.' The article's headline published by the website read- 'Military-Hating Kamala Wants To Shut Down The VA.' However, the website has described itself as satirical. Also, the website declares that all the content carried by it is fiction. Reuters have also debunked the claim. According to their report, Vice President's press secretary has confirmed that the quotation does not belong to Harris. Moreover, we could not find any evidence of these remarks in any media reports, Harris's social media channels, or the White House website that archives statements, releases, speeches, and comments made by the Biden administration. In 2019, as a part of the U.S. presidential campaign, Kamala had released a plan supporting the veterans and their families. She offered health care and housing service benefits to the militants. Later, the Joe Biden-led U.S government had introduced an 'American rescue plan' on January 20, 2021. According to the plan, the administration allocated almost $20 billion for veterans' health administration.",

        "claim": "Says Milwaukee blacks have 55 percent male unemployment, 60 percent truancy, a 50 percent graduation rate, the \"worst\" reading scores and \"lead\" in infant mortality.",
        "doc": "When an African-American tea party congressman held a \"conservative black forum\" on Capitol Hill on Jan. 23, 2012, the Milwaukee County sheriff was among the dozen panelists.David A. Clarke Jr. told the host, U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Florida, and a national C-SPAN audience about the woes of Wisconsin\u2019s largest city.\"I come from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city with a lot of issues, a lot of issues,\" Clarke said in his opening remarks.Then he rattled off a set of startling statistics:\"Fifty-five percent black male unemployment. Truancy rate of sixty percent -- sixty percent of students in the Milwaukee Public Schools system do not attend school regularly. They only graduate fifty percent of the students that do, and when they come out of there the diploma is not worth the paper that it's written on, and they probably can't even read it. We have the worst fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores in the nation. We lead in infant mortality rate and I could go on and on and on.\"Clarke is a Democrat in a largely Democratic county, but he is an outspoken conservative who often speaks bluntly about issues outside of law enforcement.So is the Milwaukee area really as bleak as the sheriff paints it? We\u2019ll look at each of the five parts of Clarke\u2019s claim: Unemployment, truancy, graduation rate, reading scores and infant mortality.Clarke's spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, confirmed that Clarke was speaking about African-Americans, rather than the total population, with the statistics he cited. She said Clarke\u2019s statements were based on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories, but she didn\u2019t provide any specific one.UnemploymentClarke said Milwaukee has \"55 percent black male unemployment.\"Does that mean the unemployment rate among black males is 55 percent?No.Clarke was likely referring to a Journal Sentinel article, published the same day as the forum, about a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study that reported an employment rate -- as opposed to the more commonly reported unemployment rate -- among black males.The study says nearly 45 percent of the area's black males ages 16 to 64 were employed in 2010.So, presumably the remaining 55 percent were unemployed.But the study arrived at its figures by counting virtually all black males, including those who aren\u2019t actively looking for work, such as those who are incarcerated, disabled or full-time students.In contrast, unemployment -- the rate most commonly measured by the government and reported in the news media -- is based on the number people who are unemployed but actively looking for work. That\u2019s a much smaller group.Indeed, the UWM study said that black male unemployment rate for metro Milwaukee in 2010 was 29.5 percent.So, this part of Clarke\u2019s claim is misleading in that \"black male unemployment\" is far less than 55 percent.TruancyClarke said the truancy rate among black students in Milwaukee Public Schools is 60 percent.The latest data from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, for the 2009-2010 school year, show 59.5 percent of black MPS students were habitually truant -- absent from school without an acceptable excuse for part or all of five or more days during a semester. So this part of Clark\u2019s claim, rounded up a half-percentage point, is accurate.Graduation rateClarke said the graduation rate among black Milwaukee Public Schools students is 50 percent.But, as a May 2011 Journal Sentinel article reported, the 2010 high school graduation rate for black MPS students was 59.5 percent, according to the latest available figures from the Department of Public Instruction.That means this part of Clarke\u2019s claim is wrong.Reading scoresClarke said black Milwaukee Public Schools students have \"the worst fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores in the nation.\"The Journal Sentinel reported in December 2011 on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests administered by the federal government in urban school districts.On the reading test, black fourth-graders in MPS tied with Cleveland for last place among 20 districts studied. Black MPS eighth-graders ranked 18th, ahead of the District of Columbia and Fresno, Calif.So, Clarke is a bit off on quoting the study. This part of his claim is also overstated in that the study considered only 20 school districts; the study doesn\u2019t indicate whether MPS reading scores are among the worst for all U.S. districts.Infant mortalityClarke said \"we lead\" in black infant mortality.The Journal Sentinel reported in January 2011 on a Milwaukee Health Department study which found that, from 2005 through 2008, the black infant mortality rate in Milwaukee was 15.7 deaths for every 1,000 births -- 2.5 times higher than the white rate.The report said that for a slightly shorter period -- 2005-2007 -- Milwaukee\u2019s black infant mortality rate was lower than Detroit\u2019s and Philadelphia\u2019s, but higher than many large cities, including New York, Chicago, St. Louis and Minneapolis.So, although the study didn\u2019t cover a large number of cities, Clarke\u2019s suggestion that Milwaukee is among cities with a higher black infant mortality rate is accurate.Our ratingClarke was correct in two parts of his claim: Black Milwaukee Public Schools students have a 60 percent truancy rate and Milwaukee has one of the higher black infant mortality rates among U.S. cities.Clarke was wrong in two parts. He overstated unemployment among black males in metro Milwaukee, which was 29.5 percent in 2010, and he understated the graduation rate among black MPS students; it is nearly 60 percent.On the remaining part of the claim, reading scores among black MPS students were nearly the worst among 20 school districts in a study. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were the worst in the nation, which is what Clarke said.On balance, we rate Clarke\u2019s statement Half True.",

The minister was mocked by the Indian National Congress following a candid conversation with actor Nana Patekar on the show 'Assal Pavhane, Irsal Namune' aired on Colours Marathi, last week. However, at a press conference on October 10, Gadkari refuted the news articles and said they were baseless. Gadkari said he never mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi or BJP in the interview. #WATCH: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari clarifies on his earlier reported statement that 'BJP overpromised in 2014 elections'. pic.twitter.com/WCDkYiqSZf \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 10, 2018 Earlier in the week, the Congress party culled a clip from the interview and tweeted it with a cheeky post that said, \"Good to see Union Minister @nitin_gadkari concurring with our view that the Modi Govt was built on jumlas and fake promises.\" Good to see Union Minister @nitin_gadkari concurring with our view that the Modi Govt was built on jumlas and fake promises. pic.twitter.com/DewDbnd16w \u2014 Congress (@INCIndia) October 8, 2018 Congress President Rahul Gandhi also shared the video clip taking a dig at the minister. Gandhi's tweet in Hindi translates as, \"Rightly said. People also think that the government has made their dreams and hopes a victim of its greed.\" Several news outlets such as Congress mouthpiece National Herald. the Times Of India and Bloomberg Quint have extrapolated Gadkari's quotes. National Herald's headline said, ' Watch: Modi government was built on false promises, says Union Minister Nitin Gadkari'. \"In a rather candid confession, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Narendra Modi came to power on the basis of unrealistic promises, which unexpectedly gave false hopes to the people of the country.\" - National Herald wrote. Gadkari's statement: In Context While Gadkari's politically improper comment was linked to the 2014 elections, the topic of discussion began much earlier when the show's anchor asked Gadkari why the state BJP government failed to act on its pre-election promise to book those who were guilty of scams during the previous government's rule (Click here from time counter 35:10 onwards). Gadkari admitted that while they have not been able to punish those guilty in the irrigation scam, the state has suffered due to legal cases in the courts and government officials 'demoralised' by several court rulings are not keen to take quick decisions. Gadkari also cited the example of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where irrigation projects worth thousands of crores were cleared and will benefit the farmers in the state while the farmers in Maharashtra will continue to suffer due to the incomplete projects and petty politics between the various political parties. \"Who loses out? It is not the BJP or the Congress, but the farmers of this state,\" said Gadkari. At this point, Nana Patekar intervenes to say that the question has come up as the party had made several promises before the 2014 state elections. Following is the transcript of what Gadkari said which led to his now controversial soundbite - Nitin Gadkari: \"In politics, please keep this in mind. Politics is a game of compulsions, limitations and contradictions.\" Nana Patekar: \"You are saying that now, but that is not what you said during the elections.\" Nitin Gadkari: \"I never said that....\" (All three participants on the show laugh, even as Gadkari continues to speak). Nitin Gadkari: \"About two or three issues, Devendra (Fadnavis) was the Chairman and there was Gopinath Munde, I had told them not to do anything about toll nakas. And I took the view that presently do not include in the manifesto (not clear\u2026.) We were so confident that in our lifetime, we will not come to power in the state. So our people were saying, \u201cSay what you want, where are you going to be held responsible\u201d But now our government has come\u2026. now you know what did Gadkari say, what did Fadnavis say?\u2026 You people ask, didn't you say this, now what? We laugh and move on. This is how it works. \" The minister correctly points out in his clarification earlier this week, that he never spoke anything about PM Narendra Modi or the party's election campaign during the 2014 general elections in the country. Though it is not clear why the union minister chose to make such a light-hearted comment about its chances in the elections. It had become quite clear before the state elections that the BJP on the back of the Modi wave had a strong chance to unseat the Congress-NCP combine when the state went to polls in October 2014. As expected, the BJP-Shiv Sena came to power after a gap of 15 years in the state. It was not just the Congress party or its mouthpiece National Herald who misquoted Gadkari. The country's largest newspaper daily, the Times Of India's headline said, ' Nitin Gadkari reveals why PM Narendra Modi vowed to put 15 lakh in your account'. But Gadkari does not make any mention of Rs 15 lakhs in the two-part episode. We also found the newspaper's recently formed fact-checking desk's article, where they have presented Gadkari's quote in the correct context, without citing it's own incorrect article. Meanwhile Bloomberg Quint's article also misquoted Gadkari with its headline, \"We Made False Promises to Win 2014 Elections, Says Nitin Gadkari\". The story has been taken down and is no longer available on the website. Editor's Note: In an earlier version of the article, we had mentioned that Bloomberg Quint is yet to make any corrections in the story. The website has informed BOOM that they have retracted and a correction posted across social media.",

        "claim": "children don\u2019t need to get a COVID-19 vaccine; the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines is in doubt",
        "doc": "185 SHARES Share Tweet Introduction On 27 September 2021, the group Project Veritas published a video on several social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, containing claims that children don\u2019t need to get a COVID-19 vaccine and that the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines is uncertain. The claims are based on an interview with two people identified in the video as employees of the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J & J): scientist Justin Durrant and business lead Brandon Schadt. J & J developed one of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the U.S. Altogether, copies of the video have received more than 2 million views to date, although the copy on Facebook has since been removed. Identity of individuals in the video In order to verify the identities of both people in the video, Health Feedback first reached out to J & J for comment, but didn\u2019t receive a response. We will update this review if new information becomes available. We also searched for social media profiles and scientific publication records, as these might provide information that would be consistent with the identification of both individuals provided by the video, thereby assisting in verification. With regards to Durrant\u2019s identification as a scientist, we were unable to find any scientist by that name, or scientific publication records listing such an author, in Google Scholar and ResearchGate (a social networking site for scientists) demonstrating expertise in vaccines or immunology. Searching for Justin Durrant on PubMed, a database of biomedical research publications maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, yielded just one publication, co-authored by a Justin W. Durrant whose affiliation is listed as College of Dental Medicine, Roseman University. That publication reported the results of a study that examined the effect of cigarette smoke on cancer cells, which is unrelated to vaccines. In short, we weren\u2019t able to find a scientist named Justin Durrant with expertise in vaccines or immunology. Schadt\u2019s LinkedIn profile indeed identifies him as a business lead for J & J. It also listed his qualifications as Bachelor of Business Administration from West Virginia University. His profile lists no credentials in biology or medicine. Overall, none of the information we were able to find suggests that either individual interviewed in the video possesses the scientific expertise relevant to the claims they made about the COVID-19 vaccines in the video. Pediatricians and public health authorities recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to eligible children The claims that children don\u2019t need to get a vaccine and that the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines is in doubt are inaccurate and misleading, as we will explain below. Scientific evidence has shown that children in general are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 or die from COVID-19 as compared to adults. Nevertheless, certain parts in the U.S. saw a spike in the number of pediatric hospitalizations during August and September 2021, as reported by the New York Times and NBC News, likely as a result of the Delta variant\u2019s higher transmissibility. A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 14 states reported that between 1 March and 14 August 2021, there were ten times more hospitalizations in unvaccinated adolescents compared to those who were fully vaccinated[1]. In children aged 0 to four years old, hospitalizations increased tenfold. This age group isn\u2019t eligible for COVID-19 vaccination at the moment, as the COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. have only been authorized for emergency use in children aged 12 and above. The rise in child hospitalizations also led to overstretched hospitals in some parts of the U.S., given that children\u2019s hospitals and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) tend not to have as much capacity as hospitals treating adults, as reported by the New York Times. Christopher Carroll, a pediatric intensivist at Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center said to the Times: \u201cThe average pediatric I.C.U. in the U.S. has 12 beds [\u2026] In a system that small, even a few patients can quickly overrun the capacity. And there are fewer specialty trained pediatric clinicians to pick up the slack.\u201d Overstretched hospitals can and have led to difficulty in delivering medical care, as documented in the case of a 2-year-old ill with COVID-19 in Houston, who had to be airlifted to another hospital because the pediatric hospitals in that city were already full. These observations demonstrate COVID-19\u2019s impact on children, the importance of vaccination in protecting children, and underpin recommendations by public health authorities for eligible children to be vaccinated. The CDC recommends that children aged 12 and above get vaccinated. The American Academy of Pediatricians also published the same recommendation and added: \u201cAny COVID-19 vaccine authorized through Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, recommended by the CDC, and appropriate by age and health status can be used for COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents.\u201d The benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh their risks; safety monitoring thus far indicates that long-term effects from the COVID-19 vaccine aren\u2019t expected Like all medical interventions, vaccines have side effects. Many of the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines are relatively short-lived and mild, like fever, fatigue, and headache. Side effects can also happen a few weeks down the road and these can be more serious, but our experience with pre-existing vaccines suggest that these are more uncommon. As this article by the Vaccine Education Center (VEC) of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia explained, long-term side effects tend to occur within two months of vaccination. For example, a serious adverse event, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), was later found by scientists to have been caused by a particular swine flu vaccine made in 1976. GBS is a neurological disorder resulting from the body\u2019s immune system wrongly attacking the nervous system. Nearly all cases following vaccination occurred within eight weeks after vaccination. In light of this information, it is important to note that a person is more likely to develop GBS from having the flu than the flu vaccine. This means that the benefits of the flu vaccine outweigh its risks. As the VEC article stated: \u201c[W]hile the rules of science do not allow scientists to say that long-term effects can never happen, the evidence is strong that these vaccines will not cause long-term harm.\u201d Paul Offit, pediatrician and professor of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, explained in this 28 January 2021 video that long-term side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines are very unlikely: \u201cI think in those preapproval studies where the vaccines have been tested in tens of thousands of people, you could say with confidence that there wasn\u2019t at least a relatively uncommon, serious side effect. And now that the vaccine has been given to more than 10 million people, I think you can say with some confidence that there doesn\u2019t appear to be right now a very rare, serious side effect that would be something that would cause a long-term problem. But again, we need to be humble, keep our eyes open and look what happens as we vaccinate hundreds and hundreds of millions of people to make sure that there\u2019s not an additional problem. But usually when those problems occur, they occur within six weeks of a dose.\u201d Indeed, given this context, it is helpful to consider that COVID-19 vaccines have been in use for more than six months since December 2020, after the first vaccine was authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And to date, more than 214 million people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The length of time that has passed and the sheer number of people who have been vaccinated all indicate that long-term side effects are very unlikely. And another reason why long-term side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely is because the ingredients from the vaccines don\u2019t persist in the body. In this National Geographic article published in July 2021: \u201cA key reason for this limited window of side effects is the short time all vaccines stay in the body, says Onyema Ogbuagu, an infectious diseases specialist at Yale Medicine and a principal investigator of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine trial. Unlike medicines that people take every day or week, vaccines are generally administered once or a handful of times over a lifetime. The mRNA molecules used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are especially fragile, he notes, so \u2018they are out of your body in a day or so.\u2019\u201d Case of cyanide contamination of Tylenol capsules occurred in 1982 and wasn\u2019t due to manufacturing error by J & J In a further attempt to cast doubt over the J & J COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s safety, the video showed Schadt citing a case in which Tylenol was contaminated with cyanide, leading to a product recall by J & J, which Schadt claimed had happened during \u201c[his] time in consumer products\u201d. It is true that there was a highly publicized case of mass murder committed by someone who had laced Tylenol capsules with potassium cyanide, also known as the Chicago Tylenol murders. Seven people died\u2014the perpetrator was never caught. However, this case occurred in 1982, long before Schadt began working at J & J in 2008, and there have been no other recorded incidents like this in the U.S. Using this incident to cast doubt on the vaccine is also misleading, given that the poisonings didn\u2019t arise from a manufacturing error on J & J\u2019s part, but as a result of someone tampering with products that were already on shelves. The incident did prompt J & J to develop new product protection, such as tamper-proof packaging to prevent cases like this from occurring again, which led to overall improvements for the safety of over-the-counter drugs.

        "doc": "\"Biden waves and points to nobody again,\" says text over a video shared July 12, 2023 by Tim Young, a conservative comedian and social media personality. Young's posts show a roughly 13-second clip from the close of Biden's July 12 address in Vilnius, Lithuania, during which he vowed the West \"will not waver\" in its support of Ukraine against Russia's invasion. The remarks followed a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a summit for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But despite the social media posts, Biden did not wave \"to nobody\" -- the video is zoomed in and edited to omit the spectators Biden waved at. Other footage captured by AFP and other news organizations (archived here and here) shows the full crowd surrounding Biden's stage. AFP also took several photos of the audience, including people situated toward the right side of the stage at Vilnius University -- the direction of Biden's wave. AFP contacted the White House for comment, but no response was forthcoming. Similarly edited or altered clips purporting to show Biden sleeping, confused or misreading social cues have targeted the Democrat for years, often amplified by opponents who argue he is too old for the job at 80. AFP has debunked other misinformation about Biden waving at no one here.",

        "claim": "Emergency Alerts will let the government know which phones are active, where they are, and will link the government to a user's personal data through the data collected when they signed into a venue using the NHS Covid-19 app during the pandemic.",
        "doc": "Several Facebook posts claim that the government's new emergency alert system will allow personal data to be collected, and that this will be matched with data collected when people signed into venues during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is not true. The post, which also appears on Instagram , says: \"On 23rd April the government will send a 'test' emergency alert to all mobile phones. You won't be able to use you phone until you acknowledge that alert. \"When you do, the government will know exactly which phones are active, where and be able to link them to you personal data through the data they collected when you use your App to sign into a pub during Covid [sic]\". Another post incorrectly says that the government is using the emergency alert for \"data harvesting\". Misinformation about what data is being collected may lead to unnecessary alarm, and in this case, may cause people to opt out of the alerts (as many online have claimed they have) and therefore risk not being warned about nearby dangers in future. Full Fact has written before about false claims about data collection, including that the Covid-19 vaccines supposedly use microchips to harvest personal data. Emergency Alerts service Emergency Alerts is a new government service to warn people via their phones or tablets if there's a nearby \"danger to life\", for example in the case of severe flooding, fire or extreme weather. Only emergency services and government departments, agencies and public bodies dealing with emergencies will be able to send the alerts, with advice about how to stay safe during the emergency. The system is due to be tested across the UK on Sunday 23 April, on devices that use 4G or 5G networks . The alert will appear as a notification and loud siren-like sound for up to 10 seconds. Personal data The Cabinet Office has confirmed to Full Fact that the alerts will not collect personal data. The alerts will also not enable the government to know if phones are active or where they are. In an information sheet about the alerts, the government said : \"The system uses the cell tower your phone is connected to. When an alert is triggered, all towers in the area will broadcast the alert. \"To do this the Government does not need to know the specific location or personal data on your device.\" The government website describes the alert as \" one-way \" and confirms that the alert does not require the government to know any individual phone numbers. Full Fact has also recently written about a post falsely claiming that phone companies breached GDPR by giving the government access to personal data. Covid-19 check-in data Since no data is collected by the Emergency Alert system, it isn't possible for it to be matched with personal data collected during the pandemic, as the post claims. Besides, the NHS Covid-19 app did not share personal information , such as someone's name and address, with local authorities. It shared the time and date an infected person visited a venue. Venue check-in data on the app was held for only 21 days. Can you use your phone? The Facebook post also claims that you won't be able to use your phone until the emergency alert has been acknowledged. The Cabinet Office confirmed the emergency alert will not prevent calls coming through or end a call in progress, and those calling a phone that has not acknowledged the alert will not be sent to voicemail. Notifications will still come through to the device's home screen and will be underneath the emergency alert. However, the emergency alert will need to be acknowledged by pressing 'ok' before the phone can be used as usual.",

        "doc": "In April 2022, thousands of social media users enthusiastically shared what appeared to be a photograph of Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth knighting, with a sword, a black cat named \u201cRuben.\u201d The April 1 post, published by the \u201cRuben the Cat\u201d Facebook page, showed Elizabeth holding out her investiture sword towards a black cat whose front paws are placed on the knighting stool. The text caption read: I am very proud to finally announce that I have become the first cat to be awarded honours by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Love, Sir Ruben J. Cat, KBE. In reality, that picture was the result of some relatively decent digital editing, and did not actually show Elizabeth knighting Ruben \u2014 a black cat from Exeter, England, who has garnered a loyal online following in recent months. The Facebook post was no more than a bit of fun, and our rating is \u201cFalse.\u201d The original photograph was actually taken in 2019, and showed the queen knighting the English actor Simon Russell Beale. The picture was taken by the PA Images (formerly Press Association) photographer Yui Mok, on Oct. 10, 2019. The PA Images caption reads as follows: \u201cSir Simon Russell Beale is made a Knight Bachelor of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Thursday October 10, 2019.\u201d The true origins of the photograph can be seen in a few key places, as demonstrated in the collage below: the facial expression of the guard standing behind Elizabeth; the presence of a man walking through the hallway into the room next to the investiture room, in the background; and the posture of the guard to the far right of the picture. All these features are identical across both pictures: Ruben is a black cat owned by the Brammer family in Exeter, on the south west coast of England. In recent months, his website and social media pages have gained tens of thousands of followers intrigued by his daily adventures and tendency to wander from house to house. ",

        "claim": "\"Although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida's 25 districts, their districts received 60 percent of the stimulus funds.\"",
        "doc": "The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. Some Republicans say the site is a bunch of unreliable propaganda. Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller ridiculed the site in a newsletter Nov. 19, writing about how he looked on the Web site and found jobs created in Florida's 34th, 53rd, 86th, and \"00th\" districts. \"The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist,\" Miller wrote. \"Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts.\" \"We know that the Administration is pulling a 'jobs created or saved' number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high,\" Miller wrote. \"The people of Florida know. We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida\u2019s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption.\" Miller was right that Recovery.gov did have incorrect information on it. Officials blamed it on errors entering the data and have since replaced the erroneous districts with the notation \"unassigned congressional district.\" ABC News broke the story on Nov. 16 and the corrections were made about two days later. The error caught our attention here at PolitiFact, and we archived the Florida page that confirms Miller's observations on bad district data. We rated Miller's statement on this Mostly True. So Miller was correct about the errors on Recovery.gov congressional districts, though they're fixed now. But was he right that Democratic districts are receiving more money than Republican districts? It's worth noting that Miller is criticizing the data but is still using it to make a political point. We ran the data ourselves using the Recovery.gov numbers, and found he was correct. In Florida, Democratic districts are getting 57 percent of money reported thus far, about $3.9 billion, while Republican districts are getting 43 percent, or $2.9 billion. It's important to understand that at this point, Recovery.gov is pretty much the only game in town for quantifying the stimulus. The numbers are reported by government agencies and private businesses from around the country, and they automatically feed into Recovery.gov. The government does not independently verify the numbers, but officials have taken steps to remove numbers that seem obviously incorrect once they are pointed out. Nevertheless, officials are aware that the data at times contain errors. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent agency that does investigations for Congress, found that while agencies and employers were making good-faith efforts to report data, the reporting has been inconsistent. \"Even recipients of similar types of funds appear to have interpreted the reporting guidance in somewhat different ways and took different approaches in how they developed their jobs data,\" the agency said in a report filed last week. Looking at stimulus money in Florida, we noticed that the money and jobs reported for District 2 -- a seat in North Florida held by Democrat Allen Boyd -- stuck out like a sore thumb. That district reported almost 24,000 jobs saved or created and $2.2 billion in funding. The next closest is District 11, a seat in Tampa held by Democrat Kathy Castor. Her district listed 430 jobs saved or created and $428 million in funding. We suspected that statewide funding is being applied to Boyd's district because it includes the state capital in Tallahassee. In fact, we found a project for the Florida Department of Education that listed close to 13,200 jobs saved or created and $1.5 billion in funding -- all credited to District 2. The project details said it was intended to pay for teachers, teachers' aides and other educational staff. The fund was tagged as being for the \"State Fiscal Stabilization Fund,\" which aimed to make up statewide budget shortfalls. This suggested that much of the money credited to Boyd's Tallahassee district was actually spent statewide. We contacted the office of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, and a spokesman confirmed our observation about the 13,200 jobs. \"These jobs represent statewide information and statewide jobs,\" said spokesman Sterling Ivey in an e-mail. \"Showing them in the Tallahassee Congressional District or in Leon County does not reflect that the jobs are statewide. Our hope is that the federal reporting system will be refined to more accurately reflect the information.\" We also asked him whether there was any evidence that the money was being distributed in a partisan manner. \"Most of the funds are distributed through existing federal funding formulas or through competitive processes. Don Winsted, Special Advisor to Governor Crist, has closely observed this process throughout and has seen no evidence of partisan distribution of funds. \"It is probably fair to criticize the federal reporting process (and last week\u2019s GAO report on job reporting does exactly that), but the shortcomings are largely attributable to a first attempt to report very complex information rather than any partisan dimension,\" Ivey said. Remove the Department of Education funding from the Democratic side of the ledger, and the total for Democratic districts actually drops a bit below the total for Republican districts: $2.4 billion vs. $2.9 billion. We asked Miller's staff about this, and they sent us the following statement from the congressman: \"Recovery.gov made numerous errors in reporting of jobs and Stimulus money disbursements on their website. Although some of their errors have been removed from the site, it would not surprise me if there were other errors in the assigning of disbursements to the wrong Congressional District.\" Clearly, the data on Recovery.gov is subject to some amount of clerical errors and distortions. Those errors might be unintentional, but the data should still be approached with caution. And we should note this isn't the first time that we've seen problems with the Obama administration's aggressive promotion of stimulus numbers. Back in May, President Barack Obama said the economic stimulus has \" saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs \" in its first 100 days. That was an estimate created by White House economic advisers, and independent economists we interviewed said that it was far too early to create a definite projection with a high level of accuracy. So we rated his statement Barely True. On the other hand, our reporting has also found the stimulus is properly credited for contributing to 3.5 percent growth in the Gross Domestic Product during the third quarter. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh said all that was due to Cash for Clunkers and a homebuyers tax credit , but we found that Half True. In the claim we're examining here, Rep. Jeff Miller said, \"Although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida's 25 districts, their districts received 60 percent of the stimulus funds.\" Recovery.gov is the primary source for data on the stimulus, and it does show more money going to Democrats. But it didn't take us long to notice that the projects reported in at least one Democratic district are way off. Miller himself said the data was unreliable, but then uses the same data to say Democrats are getting more money. That doesn't seem to be the case. We rate his statement Barely True.",

The claim seems to have originated from comments Biden made during an ABC News town hall on Oct. 15. About 24 minutes into the town hall, Biden was asked what he had to say \"to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them.\" Biden responded that there are two things he\u2019s cared about throughout his career: enabling Black Americans to generate wealth and education. He talked about the importance of pre-kindergarten education and successfully completing 12 years of school after that. Then he pivoted to housing and affordability, and compared white homebuyers to Black homebuyers. If a house was built in a white neighborhood and then the same exact house was built in a Black neighborhood, the home in the Black neighborhood would be valued at 29% less than the home in the white neighborhood. \"We\u2019ve got to end this,\" Biden said. He then talked about his own family history, saying that after his father lost his job he couldn\u2019t afford to buy a home for years, but that once he did, the Biden family was able to start accumulating wealth. In the meantime, though, \"we lived in an apartment,\" Biden said, \"which became Section 8 housing much later.\" Biden then says, \"It wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was just normal apartments.\" He didn\u2019t claim to live in Section 8 housing, a program that was authorized by Congress in 1974 to provide rental subsidies for eligible Americans. Biden would have been about 32 in 1974. We rate this Facebook post False.",

        "doc": "The house withstood Hurricane Ike in 2008 owing to its construction standards when it was built in 2005. No exorcisms ever took place in that house. An image of a single house surrounded by debris near a coastline is making rounds on social media platforms. The caption claims that in 2008 Hurricane Ike hit Houston and only one house remained intact because an exorcism was performed in it in 1998. However, this claim is false. The house has not been standing since 1998. On conducting a reverse image search, similar images can be found on various stock image websites like Getty Images. It is documented that in September 2008, after Hurricane Ike hit Gilchrist, a residential community in Texas, a beachfront home was standing among the debris. Further research on the house led to a report by CNN, which explains that the house was built after 2005. Warren and Pam Adams lost their house in 2005 to Hurricane Rita, and they started living in this yellow house in April 2007. The Houston Chronicle reported that Warren Adams built this house according to \"Galveston County code\" that \"anticipates 130-mile-per-hour winds on the seaward side of the county.\" In part, Adam explained that he built the house high to get a break on flood insurance. The home sits approximately 15 feet above the ground. In 2018, ten years after the Hurricane, ABC13 News reported the house on Church Street was on the list of rental findings. Swedes Real Estate named the listing the \"Last House Standing'' and noted its availability as a vacation rental. Ike is known to have been a significant storm that hit central U.S. after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The claim made on the lone standing house has been making rounds for over a decade and has also been debunked by other fact checking organizations. Indeed, Adams\u2019 house is the only one that is standing after Hurricane Ike. However, there is no basis in fact that this happened due to an exorcism.

        "claim": "Carolina Panthers quarterbacl Cam Newton was arrested for \"fixing\" Super Bowl 50.",
        "doc": "On 7 February 2016, the Denver Broncos upset the favored Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 to claim the National Football League championship for the 2015-16 season. After the game, dejected and sulking Panthers quarterback Cam Newton grew tired of answering media questions about what went wrong in the Panthers\u2019 24-10 loss to the Broncos and got up and walked off the post-game press podium after about three minutes. The following day, an online rumor claimed Newton had been arrested on charges of \u201cfixing\u201d the Super Bowl game and thus enabling himself to collect a whopping $100 million garnered from betting on the underdog Broncos: Police have arrested Cam Newton his father, his uncle Richie and seven other people, including four panthers players, over allegations of a football betting scam in which they fixed the 2016 super bowl. It is believed that there was a pattern of irregular betting, with stakes being put on the Denver Broncos at the last minute totaling 100 Million. These were done by several different accounts owned by Newtons family and linking back to Cam. Other red flags were raised by Cam\u2019s questionable gameplay by poorly throwing several passes and making no attempt to recover a fumble. Newtons 58-year-old father, also called Big Cam, is thought to have been arrested at his home. Wayne Newton, Richie Newton and two other men were later bailed pending further enquiries. 6 family members remain in custody along with four others. There was no truth to this story, however. It originated with the Daily Media Buzz, a fake news site known for publishing fabricated clickbait headlines and stories.",

        "claim": "A study found the risk of a group of patients having a heart attack within five years increased from 11% to 25% after they were given their mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.",
        "doc": "\"What this research has shown is that markers associated with increasing the risk of heart attack and probably even progression of underlying heart disease in people who have already got some heart disease. There's been a significantly increased risk from 11% at five years, the risk of heart attack, to 25%.\" Dr Aseem Malhotra, 25 November 2021 . A clip of health campaigner and cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra on GB News talking about claims linking the Covid-19 vaccines to heart attacks has gone viral on Twitter and been viewed at least one million times. He did say the findings need to be replicated to confirm whether or not they are true, but what Dr Malhotra did not mention is that the journal which published an abstract of the research has issued an \" expression of concern \" about it, noting that it contains \"potential errors\" and \"may not be reliable\". Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What the research claims The research claims to have measured various biomarkers ( biological characteristics like blood pressure) before and after patients received their second mRNA Covid-19 vaccine dose (such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines). It uses these biomarkers to calculate a \"PULS score\", pre and post-vaccination, which it claims predicts the five-year risk of developing new acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS includes a range of conditions associated with reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attacks. The research claims that results from 566 patients showed the risk of developing ACS within five years, as measured by the PULS score, increased from 11% before vaccination to 25% after vaccination. It was presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA) in the form of a poster (a format used by academics to present summary findings of research at conferences). Only the abstract has been published in an open-access format, though screenshots from the poster presentation are circulating on Twitter. Issues The \"expression of concern\" , issued by the AHA's journal Circulation, raises a number of issues with the research. One issue is that \"there are no statistical analyses for significance provided\", meaning that it is not clear if the results are due to chance or some other factor. The research claims a number of biomarkers indicating heart disease risk were elevated after vaccination, but some of these fall within the margin of error. Of the three biomarkers mentioned in the abstract, only one increased by a statistically significant amount, and we only have the margins of errors listed in the abstract to base this on. As we've said, exactly how they may have been calculated is unclear. Another issue is that the study doesn't actually measure the risk of heart attacks directly, but the PULS score. There is little evidence on why this might be a reliable metric to measure the risk of heart attacks. Oncologist Dr David Gorski, notes that on the PULS test website , the evidence given for the claim that the test has been validated actually links to a paper which claims a different, though similar, biomarker test has been validated. Circulation also says of the research paper that \"the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used,\" which means there may be an element of selection bias, affecting the legitimacy results. Additionally, the research has not been peer-reviewed. All these issues means the work cannot be used as a basis upon which to build the argument that Covid-19 vaccines increase the risk of heart attacks, as Dr Malhotra went on to say on GB News. Other evidence The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has identified an increased, though still low, risk of heart inflammation among young men in particular after receiving an mRNA vaccine. It has also noted that a side effect of the vaccines is a rapid heartbeat. It has not warned of any other link between the vaccines and any other heart condition. People who experience adverse health events after vaccination can report them via the Yellow Card scheme to be investigated.",

        "claim": "\"While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars.\"",
        "doc": "Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said he has tested thousands of rape kits that his predecessor Richard Cordray had let languish. \"While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again,\" said DeWine\u2019s TV ad narrated by rape survivor Allyssa Allison. \"Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars.\" DeWine ousted Cordray in 2010. The two men are now facing off for governor. DeWine portrays Cordray as ignoring untested rape kits as they piled up. But the backlog of untested rape kits can\u2019t be blamed mainly on the attorney general; local police departments had a role, too. The ad omits that Cordray started to address the backlog as it drew more attention in the summer of 2010, but he had little time left in office. \"Rape kits\" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, which are collected soon after a sexual assault or rape. A nurse or a doctor collects evidence including tissue and hair samples from the victim\u2019s body and clothing, including saliva, blood and semen. The evidence helps law enforcement investigate assaults. The ad said that while Cordray was attorney general, 12,000 rape kits were left untested, but they were not sitting around his office. That number reflects those that were sent in by police departments across the state once DeWine took over. Untested rape kits languishing in police evidence rooms had been a longstanding problem in many states when Cordray became Ohio attorney general in 2009. Some departments didn\u2019t test the kits, citing hassles or cost. The national backlog continues today. During Cordray\u2019s tenure, news coverage by the Cleveland Plain Dealer led to more scrutiny. Here\u2019s what was known about untested kits when Cordray was in office. In July 2010, the Cleveland Police said they had found in their possession more than 6,000 rape kits going back to 1993, some of which had already been tested. The department decided it would start submitting all kits for testing to the state. By mid 2011, Cleveland began submitting untested kits in small batches to the state, according to a timeline written by Case Western Reserve University. While Cordray was attorney general, Ohio -- like much of the country -- had no consistent testing policy. Each law enforcement agency decided whether and how to test rape kits, which could be done at local labs or sent to the state. Cleveland police decided whether to test kits on a case by case basis. The Plain Dealer reported that the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation would test every kit Cleveland planned to send, though its preference was for departments to limit their submissions to evidence that officials thought would be most likely to provide leads. (BCI is under the purview of the attorney general.) Cordray in 2010 called for lawmakers, law enforcement officials and victim advocates to study best practices for testing and develop a statewide protocol. In his final months in office, Cordray formed the Ohio Sexual Assault Kit Testing Commission and announced that the state would receive new DNA-testing robots to speed up testing. Cordray then lost to DeWine. In a recent conference call with reporters, Cordray questioned why DeWine took seven years -- until he was in the middle of a campaign -- to clear out the backlog. \"What he cannot explain is why it took him seven years to do a job he says I should have done in five months,\" he said. Cordray counterattacked with his own ad that featured Republican Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart. The sheriff said that Cordray put the technology in place and \"fixed\" the backlog that had stretched for decades. That\u2019s misleading -- while Cordray started to address the problem, he didn\u2019t fix it. DeWine took office in January 2011. A few months later he restarted the rape kit test commission after the Cleveland Heights police department misplaced evidence tied to Anthony Sowell, a serial killer and rapist. The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote in an editorial in May 2011 that \"building on an initiative of his predecessor, Richard Cordray, DeWine says he will stop sending DNA samples to private labs.\" Instead, the state would handle processing. In December 2011, DeWine announced that police should submit all kits for testing if a crime probably occurred. At the time, about half of sexual assault kits were submitted to the state crime labs. DeWine started a new unit with four forensic scientists to test the old kits and began the push to clear out the backlog in 2012. Six more scientists were added later. Though DeWine deserves credit for tackling the backlog, so does Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty. His office worked with Cleveland police to inventory rape kits, which resulted in identifying thousands of untested rape kits that were submitted to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2014. The General Assembly played a role, too. In 2014, Gov. John Kasich signed Senate Bill 316 to require law enforcement agencies to forward untested rape kits to the state or other crime labs within one year. In February 2018, DeWine announced that the state had analyzed 13,931 rape kits and had loaded more than 8,600 DNA profiles to a federal database used by law enforcement. (The TV ad cited 12,000 rape kits because it subtracted any rapes that occurred after Cordray left office.) DeWine said that charges had been filed against hundreds of attackers. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor said that they have convicted 376 defendants between 2013 and 2018 largely based on rapes that occurred between 1993 and 2010, before DeWine took office. The average prison sentence is 11 years. DeWine said in a TV ad, \"While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars.\" The ad leaves out a lot of context when it blames Cordray. First, it omits that Cordray inherited a statewide problem. Cordray started to take steps to address the problem, but didn\u2019t get far before he was ousted by DeWine in November 2010. The ad is on firmer ground when it gives credit to DeWine for his efforts to clear out the backlog. But it omits that it took him several years to do it. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this statement Half True.",

        "claim": "\u201cThe Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008. The Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters\u2026 (while) voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.\u201d",
        "doc": "Just before the Libertarian Party of Texas held its state convention, it suggested its fortunes are rising while the two major political parties are on the decline. \u201cThe Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008,\u201d the Libertarians said in a June 7 press release. \u201cThe Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters in that time period. There is one exception: the Libertarian Party. Over the same time frame, voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.\u201d Did the major parties bleed voters while the LPT surged? Significantly, party affiliations based on voter registration records can only be gauged in the 29 states that allow citizens to declare an affiliation when they register. Texas is among 21 states that don\u2019t permit voters to air a preference at registration time. To back up its claim, the Texas party\u2019s release cites a blog post on smallgovtimes.com. We found that post largely based on research by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of Public and International Affairs at George Mason University. McDonald cites his research in two May posts at Pollster.com. In his first post, McDonald writes that since the 2008 election, voters registering as Democrats are down by 2.7 percent and voters registering as Republicans have dropped 3.5 percent in those states where voters are allowed to register an affiliation. Voters registering their affiliation with a minor party increased by 2.4 percent, he writes. Still, McDonald does not see an incipient minor-party revolution afoot. \u201cAmerica is a long way from having a viable multi-party system at the federal level, like we are currently witnessing in the United Kingdom,\u201d he says in his second post. \u201cHowever, these trends are consistent with the notion that some American voters are willing to express their frustration with the major parties by registering with a minor political party or affiliating with no party. Indeed, the increase in unaffiliated registrations is a long-term phenomenon observed since the 1970s.\u201d We contacted McDonald in hopes of boring in on Libertarian voter registrations. He told us he did not separately calculate registration for minor parties, but referred us to Richard Winger, a Libertarian himself and the editor of Ballot Access News, a monthly newsletter. A May 26 blog post by Winger says Libertarian registrations in places that allow registration by party are up 8 percent since October 2008 \u2014 the figure cited in the release from the Texas Libertarians. Generally, Winger writes, more \u201cvoters are registered Libertarians now than ever before. Between October 2008 and this spring, Libertarian registration rose in 19 of the 23 states that tally Libertarians. It declined in four states, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota,\u201d a state where the party has not been on the ballot since 2006.Professor McDonald told us he still doesn\u2019t see Libertarians succeeding at the polls unless, he said, they move en masse to, say, lightly populated Wyoming. \u201cThey\u2019re not concentrated enough in one state or district in order to win elections,\u201d he said.Here\u2019s why: Regardless of cited changes in party affiliation percentage-wise, the raw numbers of voters registering affiliations underscore the dominance of the major parties. As researched by McDonald, some 43.3 million voters now line up as Democrats, while 29.9 million align as Republicans. Meanwhile, 2.2 million voters are registered as members of minor parties. As of May, according to Winger\u2019s research, more than 259,000 voters had registered affiliations with the Libertarian Party.Even if we assume that some of nearly 23.6 million unaffiliated voters in states where voters can register their affiliations end up supporting Libertarians at the polls, their numerical share of the electorate is swamped by either of the major parties.In elections, numbers are everything. That brings us to a statistical problem with the Libertarian\u2019s statement: it compares a reduction in numbers (how many voters fell off the Democratic and Republican rolls) with an increase in a percentage (the share of voters affiliated with the Libertarian party).Patrick Dixon of Lago Vista, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Texas, told us that\u2019s how the information was presented on the cited online sources. \u201cMaybe I was a little lazy there,\u201d Dixon said. Regardless, he said, the trend is that \u201cour party is growing and theirs are shrinking or growing flat.\u201dIn fact, McDonald\u2019s breakdown, shown on a chart in his first May blog post, tracks registrations both by raw numbers and percentages for the two major parties and all minor parties lumped together.Upshot: Based on voter registrations in 29 states that allow voters to declare their party affiliation, the statistics cited by the Libertarian Party are correct.But comparing raw numbers and percentages to make a point, as the Libertarians do, can leave a distorted impression: that the major parties are fading away as the Libertarians gallop ahead. Voter for voter, that\u2019s at least an incomplete characterization.We rate the statement Half True.",

        "claim": "House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \"blocked\" Republican efforts to read the names of 13 U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan on Aug. 26, 2021.",
        "doc": "In August and September 2021, several right-leaning websites and Republican Congress members made outraged claims that House Democrats, and in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, had \u201cblocked\u201d their attempts to read the names of the 13 U.S. troops killed in an Islamic State group attack at Kabul airport in Afghanistan. For example, on Aug. 31, U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Florida, wrote on Twitter: \u201cHouse Democrats just refused to recognize Republican veterans on the House Floor to read the names of our fallen service members in Afghanistan. That\u2019s how far our nation has fallen.\u201d While U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Florida, framed the incident as part of an alleged \u201ccover up,\u201d by Democrats, of the Kabul attack: \u201cHow badly do Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats want to cover up this Afghanistan debacle? They just blocked Members of Congress from reading the names of the service members who sacrificed their lives in Afghanistan last week.\u201d A third Republican Congressman from the state, Brian Mast, made similar claims in an interview with the right-leaning Floridian website: Rep.Brian Mast(R), a wounded combat veteran from Afghanistan, tells The Floridian that during a Republican-only \u201cmoment of silence,\u201d Speaker Pelosi refused to recognize them to\u201d read names or bring up bills or anything.\u201d \u201cWe gaveled in, had a prayer, said the Pledge of Allegiance, took a moment of silence with pretty much all Republican veterans, then asked to be recognized to read names and bring up Afghanistan legislation. They did not acknowledge us, and just closed the House down,\u201d said Rep. Mast. Similar articles, which either leveled or uncritically repeated the allegation that Democrats had \u201cblocked\u201d Republican House members from reading the names of the troops, were published by Mass Central, American Military News, Law Enforcement Today, Breitbart, the U.S. Sun, Becker News, the Daily Wire, and the Washington Examiner. Many of those reports specifically accused Pelosi of having been responsible for \u201cblocking\u201d GOP efforts to read the list of names, and none of them mentioned a crucial contextual fact about the Aug. 31 House session in question, which is explained in detail below. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cMostly False.\u201d The claim that Pelosi, in particular, had \u201cblocked\u201d the House Republicans in question, was demonstrably false. Video of the Aug. 31 session, which only lasted a few minutes, clearly shows that the House Speaker was not even present in the chamber during the incident in question. Rather, the session was overseen by U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., whom Pelosi had designated as the speaker pro tempore: The sequence of events was as follows (all times EDT): 11:30 a.m.: The session opened11:30 a.m.: The House Clerk read a note from Pelosi, designating Dingell speaker pro tempore11:30 a.m.: House Chaplain Margaret Grun Kibben read a prayer11:32 a.m.: Dingell formally approved the journal of the previous day\u2019s proceedings (Aug. 27)11:32 a.m.: House members recited the Pledge of Allegiance11:33 a.m.: Dingell asked the House to join in observing a moment of silence in honor of the 13 U.S. troops killed in Kabul on Aug. 2611:34 a.m.: Dingell adjourned the House until Sept. 3. Clamor is audible among Republican members, but no specific remarks are discernible. The video footage of the Aug. 31 session provides no evidence that Dingell was even aware, at the time she adjourned the session, that Republican members were attempting to make remarks of some kind, nor that she was aware specifically that they wanted to read out the names of the troops killed in Kabul. Snopes asked the House Republican Conference, as well as Steube, Gimenez and Mast \u2014 the three House Republicans who criticized Democrats for \u201cblocking\u201d their efforts on Aug. 31 \u2014 whether any Republican had made any advanced request or given any advanced notification, verbal or written, to Pelosi, Dingell or any Democrats, that they wanted to read out the names of the troops during the Aug. 31 session. We also asked those House Republicans for a copy of any written correspondence that would demonstrate that Pelosi, Dingell or their respective staffs, were aware in advance that the GOP members wanted to make remarks from the floor, and that they were aware of the content of those remarks. We did not receive a response of any kind. Furthermore, several of the reports highlighted above described the moment of silence held on Aug. 31 as being \u201cRepublican\u201d or \u201cRepublican only.\u201d This is laughable. It was Dingell, from the chair, who initiated that moment of silence, saying: \u201cThe chair asks that all members in the chamber, as well as members and staff throughout the Capitol, to rise for a moment of silence in remembrance of the 13 service members who were killed during the terrorist bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan on Aug. 26.\u201d Setting aside the blatantly inaccurate claims of Pelosi\u2019s involvement in the session, the question then becomes whether Dingell or other Democrats \u201cblocked\u201d House Republicans from reading out the names. In order to address that contention, one essential piece of context must be explained, something the GOP representatives and online articles highlighted above completely failed to do \u2014 the Aug. 31 meeting of the House was a \u201cpro forma\u201d session. Every two years, American voters elect a new Congress, composed of the House and Senate. For example, the current Congress is the 117th, which began on Jan. 3, 2021, and will last until Jan. 3, 2023. The last Congress, from Jan. 2019 to Jan. 2021, was the 116th. In turn, each Congress is made up of two annual sessions. Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution states, in part: \u201cNeither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days\u2026\u201d If either the House or Senate fail to meet for more than three days, that chamber is deemed to be in a \u201crecess of the session.\u201d Falling into a recess of the session triggers various administrative and technical procedures and protocols, with arguably the most significant being the ability of the U.S. president to make \u201crecess appointments,\u201d which can often be a source of considerable political tension and controversy. In order to avoid falling into a recess of the session, while allowing House members to stay in their far-flung districts and (in principle) work on behalf of their constituents, Congress has developed a long-standing tradition of holding \u201cpro forma\u201d sessions, derived from the Latin phrase meaning \u201cfor the sake of form.\u201d As the Congressional Research Service explains: Both houses have also used pro forma sessions as a means of establishing a constituency work period without requiring a \u201crecess of the session.\u201d A chamber may effectively establish a one week constituency work period, for example, by arranging to meet only on Monday and Thursday of the week in question, and only for short sessions at which no business is to occur. In this way, none of the intervals between daily sessions need constitute an adjournment for three days or more\u2026 By convention, and by the agreement of all parties, pro forma sessions do not involve any substantive legislative activity, such as votes, motions, debates or remarks from the floor. One significant logistical reason for this is that introducing a bill, for example, could require hundreds of Congress members to quickly return to Washington D.C. from their home districts, in order to debate and vote on the legislation \u2014 something that would, at various times, cause considerable inconvenience and mutual resentment among members from all sides. In order to avoid such scenarios, a tradition has developed over time whereby pro forma sessions take place simply in order to keep the House and Senate from falling into a recess of the session, and do not exist for the purpose of any substantive legislative business, or political controversy. Thus, it would be accurate to say that, during the Aug. 31 House session, it was the uniformly agreed-upon conventions and protocols surrounding pro forma House sessions \u2014 not Dingell, and certainly not Pelosi \u2014 that \u201cblocked\u201d House Republicans from reading out the names of the troops killed in Kabul. In this way, the claims and allegations made by various right-leaning websites, as well as some House Republicans, were profoundly misleading and \u2014 assuming those members were aware of the conventions surrounding pro forma sessions \u2014 disingenuous. However, one disclaimer needs to be presented at this point. Pro forma sessions are governed by convention and tradition, but not formal written rules and regulations. As the Congressional Research Service explains, a pro forma session \u201cdoes not have a precise formal sense,\u201d but is commonly used to describe \u201ca short daily session of either chamber in which little or no business is transacted.\u201d While bound by the conventions surrounding pro forma sessions, we could find no written rule which technically precludes the chair of the House from acknowledging members and, in principle, allowing them to make remarks such as the ones House Republicans claim they attempted to make. However, evidence is so far completely lacking that, in this specific instance, either Pelosi or Dingell had any awareness of what the GOP members were endeavoring to do, on the floor. Even if they were aware of the content of the remarks, departing from protocol by allowing such remarks to be made would have posed a significant risk of setting a precedent that could, over time, undermine the functional purpose of the conventions surrounding pro forma sessions. Finally, the broader claim that Pelosi and Dingell were supposedly motivated by a desire to \u201ccover up\u201d the deaths of the 13 service members in Kabul, is also contradicted by the facts. In a news release on Aug. 31, Pelosi named each of the 13 troops, adding: \u201cWe are united in prayer for the thirteen U.S. servicemembers killed last Thursday as they helped bring over 124,000 Americans, allies and Afghan partners to safety, an act of profound valor, selflessness and sacrifice.\u201d Dingell, for her part, is one of 238 co-sponsors of a bipartisan bill to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to each of those 13 service members. On Sept. 10, nine days after its original article was published, Breitbart updated its report on the controversy to include the following editor\u2019s note: According to Pelosi spokesperson Robyn Patterson, House Republicans did not request in advance to read the names of the fallen, but rather did so after the moment of silence, which was a protocol violation.In a pro forma session no legislative business is conducted and there are no votes, floor resolutions, or free-speech periods. As of Sept. 13, none of the other articles highlighted above have been updated to reflect this crucial piece of context.",

        "claim": "The Trump administration is paying Southwest Key $458 million to run immigrant child detention centers, and its CEO earns a $1.5 million salary.",
        "doc": "In late June 2018, a series of investigative news reports exposed the fact that Juan Sanchez, the chief executive of non-profit Southwest Key, was making a salary of $1.5 million while his organization had scored $458 million in federal grants to shelter detained children who had been taken from their parents at the southern U.S. border. The reports came amid widespread outrage over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy and as viral stories often do, resulted in a number of memes that spread throughout social media: Introducing pic.twitter.com/aYaDYIY38z \u2014 Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) June 21, 2018 Although memes are not always factual, the one shared by actor Samuel Jackson is. The figures were taken from a 19 June 2018Bloomberg report: The nonprofit, Southwest Key Programs Inc., is to be paid more than $458 million in fiscal 2018, according to the data \u2014 the most among the organizations, government agencies and companies that run a detention and care system for immigrant children on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services. Southwest Key has about a dozen facilities in Texas, including a site at a former WalMart Inc. store in Brownsville that has drawn attention from members of Congress and national news organizations. [\u2026] Southwest Key rapidly increased the compensation of its CEO, Juan Sanchez, from about $269,000 in 2010 to more than $786,000 in 2015, the most recent year for which its tax returns are available through the website Guidestar.org. His compensation nearly doubled to $1.5 million in 2016, according to tax records for an Austin charter school he founded. We independently confirmed with tax records publicly available through the non-profit tracking site Guidestar.org and public financial data posted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees programs for unaccompanied immigrant children, that the figures reported by Bloomberg are accurate. Sanchez\u2019s salary and money awarded to his non-profit both ballooned in recent years. In fiscal year 2017, Southwest Key was awarded more than$285,000,000 and about $211,000,000 in 2016. Sanchez\u2019s salary roughly doubled from 2015 to 2016. The Austin-based charity runs27 immigrant children\u2019s shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, according to an archived version of its web site (which is currently down). It has been awarded almost half of the $948 million budgeted for the care of unaccompanied immigrant children by HHS. Southwest Key became the focus of heightened scrutiny in June 2018 amid outcry over Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy enacted in April 2018. Under the policy, all adults who cross the border between ports of entry were charged with federal offenses and their accompanying children were taken from them. Many of those children were placed at Southwest Key facilities, including Casa Padre, a converted WalMart in Brownsville, Texas reportedly holding 1,500. As people began asking questions about the welfare and whereabouts of the children, unpleasant answers began emerging. Among those providing those answers has been Antar Davidson, a 32-year-old whistleblower who worked atEstrella del Norte, a Southwest Key shelter in Tucson, Arizona from February 21 to 12 June 2018. Davidson described scenes of chaos after \u201czero tolerance\u201d went into effect. The facility was unprepared for the stream of younger children that began around May. The children, he said, were traumatized, disoriented, and acting out, running around, throwing things and fighting. \u201cIt was really a big mess,\u201d he told us in a phone interview. Davidson, who is of Brazilian descent, said he would hold classes for the martial art form capoeira. But during classes, \u201csome little six or seven year old would run in and an employee would be chasing them down.\u201d Many times, he said, the children had to be physically restrained by staffers. Training for situations requiring restraint increased in frequency when the younger children started showing up. Davidson, who quit his job out of disillusionment, confirmed a story first reported by the Los Angeles Times. At one point he was asked to translate for a group of Brazilian siblings, aged six, ten and 16, who had been separated from their parents. The distraught, crying children, who were clinging to each other, were separated and placed in different parts of the facility because they were of different ages and genders. He was told to prevent them from hugging, because the shelter has a strict \u201cno touching\u201d policy. The result of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy has been that more than 2,000 children have been taken from their parents at the border. The Trump administration has provided no information on how they will be reunified. Wrenching news stories and audio published by ProPublica of weeping children calling for their parents after being separated drew public outrage. In response, Trump signed an executive order on 20 June 2018 that does not reunite families already separated but seeks to change laws limiting the amount of time children can spend in detention, which could result in families being in detention indefinitely. We attempted to contact Southwest Key for comment and received no response.",

The tweet read, \"Two UFOs recorded by NASA eight years ago have finally been released. Two rectangular UFOs are fast moving through an 'atmosphereless' region of space. It turns out that it transcends the technology of NASA.\" The tweet ended with the hashtag, \"#Aliens.\" Readers likely won't be surprised to learn that this was not true. [See also:Is Outer Space 'Only an Hour Away' if You Could Drive Straight up at 60 MPH?] The video truly was released by NASA, but it had not been \"recorded\" with cameras. The clip showed a digital animation created byNASA's Scientific Visualization Studio thatshowed two twin spacecraft satellites from theGravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, not \"two rectangular UFOs\" being flown by aliens. (Twitter user @HoaxEye alsonotedthe truth behind this video.) The part from the tweet appears at the 1:37 mark in the video's upload on theNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory YouTube channel. The original GRACE science mission ended in October 2017.NASApublished that its purpose had been to \"study key changes in the planet's waters, ice sheets and the solid Earth\": An award-winning mission that's changed the way we study Earth's gravitational forces and the Earth system, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, mission flew twin spacecraft in tandem around Earth to study key changes in the planet's waters, ice sheets and the solid Earth. In 2011, the gravity measurement technique pioneered by GRACE, which works by measuring changes in the push and pull between the twin spacecraft as they orbit Earth, was put to use on NASA's twin GRAIL spacecraft embarking on an ambitious mission to study the gravitational forces of Earth's moon. In more than 15 years of operations, the GRACE satellite mission revolutionized our view of how water moves and is stored on Earth. GRACE measured changes in the local pull of gravity as water shifts around Earth due to changing seasons, weather and climate processes. Among its innovations, GRACE has monitored the loss of ice mass from Earth's ice sheets, improved understanding of the processes responsible for sea level rise and ocean circulation, provided insights into where global groundwater resources may be shrinking or growing and where dry soils are contributing to drought, and monitored changes in the solid Earth.

        "doc": "The images of a man, allegedly father of one of the accused in Hathras case, with UP CM Yogi Adityanath and PM Narendra Modi have gone viral The death of a 19-year-old girl in Delhi on September 29, two weeks after she was brutalised in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Hathras, has sparked nationwide outrage and protests. The state police arrested four accused - Sandeep, Ramu, Lavkush, and Ravi - in connection with the case. The accused are currently in police custody. Amid rising cries for stringent punishment for the perpetrators, some images are viral on the internet with a claim that they show the father of one of the accused in the case along with some prominent BJP leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh can be seen in these viral pictures. The caption to one such post uploaded on Facebook in the Hindi language translates to English as, \u201cYogiji and Modiji with the father of Hathras gang rape accused Sandeep. Now the four accused will be saved. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is false. The man in the viral images is Shyam Prakash Dwivedi, a BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh. Dwivedi is the regional vice president of BJP Yuva Morcha's Kashi division. Similar claims are also viral in the Bangla language on Facebook. The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here and here. AFWA probe With the help of reverse image search and appropriate keywords, we found the viral images uploaded on multiple Facebook pages in the name of Dr Shyam Praksh Dwivedi. We also found some more images of Dwivedi with other BJP leaders uploaded on these pages. According to the about section of the pages, Dwivedi is a senior BJP leader from UP\u2019s Prayagraj. Further searches led us to multiple media reports about Dwivedi. According to reports published on September 16, 2020, by Zee News and DNA, Dwivedi is an accused in a 2019 gang-rape case. Prayagraj police registered a case against him on September 16. The reports also confirmed that Dwivedi is the vice president of the BJP Yuva Morcha's Kashi unit. Reportedly, on September 27, Samajwadi Party workers took a dig at Yogi government\u2019s Operation Durachari initiative and put up controversial posters of Dwivedi near Subash Chowk in Prayagraj. Under 'Operation Durachari', the UP government said it will put up posters of people accused of crimes against women at famous road crossings across the state. Dwivedi also made headlines in 2016 after he announced a reward of Rs 1 crore to whoever cut off All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi\u2019s tongue. Owaisi had allegedly said that he would never chant 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'. Though Dwivedi was suspended from BJP following this statement, he was later re-inducted in the party. We also cross-checked the name of Hathras case accused, Sandeep\u2019s father. According to an India Today report published on September 30, Sandeep\u2019s father\u2019s name is Narendra. As per the report, Narendra was also accused of assaulting the Hathras victim\u2019s grandfather in 2001. However, these viral photos are not of accused Sandeep\u2019s father. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Viral images show the father of one of the accused in the Hathras incident along with PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath. Conclusion The image is of BJP leader and vice president of the BJP Yuva Morcha's Kashi unit - Dr Shyam Prakash Dwivedi.

        "claim": "Aruna Jain, a MasterChef India contestant, refused to cook an egg-based dish and withdrew from the 25 Lakh Price race",
        "doc": "A social media post shares a photo of Aruna Jain, a contestant in the Season-7 of MasterChef India. The post Description claims that Aruna rejected a reward of 25 lakh rupees when she was asked to cook an egg-based dish. The post claims she withdrew from the 25 Lakh Prize race by refusing to cook eggs as a Jain. Let's fact-check this claim through this article.Claim: Aruna Jain, a MasterChef India contestant, refused to cook an egg-based dish and withdrew from the 25 Lakh Price race. Fact: This incident happened in Season 7, Episode 24 of MasterChef India. Contestants were asked to cook an Egg-based dish. Aruna Vijay, who belongs to the Jain community, refused to cook an Egg-based dish owing to her faith-based principles and gave away her Immunity pin, which saves a contestant from elimination. Giving up an immunity pin does not mean a contestant has withdrawn from the competition. Hence, the claim made in the post is Misleading.A thorough search on the Internet regarding this incident led us to an article published by Latestly where it was reported that MasterChef India contestant Aruna Vijay gave up her immunity pin, and she tweeted about it. The same incident was also mentioned in an article published by the Times of India about the controversies generated by the last season of MasterChef India.After looking through the official YouTube channel (SET India) of Sony Entertainment TV, which aired this show, we found that this incident took place in Episode 24 (watch it here). When contestants were asked to prepare an egg based dish, Aruna Vijay refused to cook something she doesn't use (Egg) and gave away her immunity pin. The immunity pin saves a contestant from elimination. About this incident, Aruna Vijay expressed herself through a now-deleted tweet in which she said, 'I gave up the immunity pin for an egg, PROUD JAIN\u2026.'However, giving away an immunity pin does not mean that a contestant has rejected the prize money or has withdrawn from the competition; it means they have just lost the immunity against elimination in future episodes. Furthermore, Aruna Vijay continued her journey as a contestant until the final four, when she was eliminated. Here, you can see the episode in which she was eliminated. Here, you can watch the finale of this season in which Nayanjyothi Saikia won the contest.To sum up, Aruna Vijay gave up her immunity pin but did not withdraw herself from the competition; in fact, she continued and even reached the final four.",

        "claim": "Banks in Shanghai stopped ATM operations due to the fear of contaminated banknotes spreading COVID-19.",
        "doc": "Banking services in Shanghai were suspended during the lockdown from mid-March to the end of May but they are now fully in operation. In June, a series of tweets in different languages claimed banks in Shanghai suspended ATM operations due to the fear of contaminated cash spreading COVID-19. Most of these tweets included a video from the YouTube channel \u201cSpotlight on China,\u201d a self-claimed news channel based in the United States, which has been viewed more than 4,600 times. The posts in Chinese, English, Spanish, and Japanese have over 1,400 likes and more than 870 retweets as of this writing. The Japanese voice over of the video appears to have been generated through a text-to-speech tool. This claim, however, is misleading. Banking services in Shanghai were suspended for over two months from mid-March during the lockdown following a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in the city. Different banks told Annie Lab that they have not heard any issues about their cash being supposedly contaminated with the coronavirus. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission Shanghai Office said operations have started to normalize after the lockdown was lifted on June 1, with demand for Shanghai\u2019s banking services reaching its \u201cpeak\u201d this month due to the work that has accumulated since March. Jing Xiao Wei (\u91d1\u6653\u73ae), the head of the Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, also said the long queue was the result of accumulated financial work. Annie Lab looked into announcements from some major banks in Shanghai and found ATM services have become available in the city gradually. Postal Savings Bank of China said on May 31, 2022, that they are \u201censuring automated self-service machines function normally, to minimize the gathering and waiting time of the clients.\u201d Xinmin Evening News reported on 16 June that ATM services in Shanghai have resumed. In late May, a Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank branch opened four in-person counters and two ATMs to cope with the rising banking demands, while the Shanghai branch of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank is reported to have diverted customer flow to traditional counters or automated machines according to their needs. Even with the resumption of ATM services, however, the slots of counter services have been limited, causing the long queues. Postal Savings Bank of China in Shanghai set a quota of 40 bank accounts per day for offline banking services, pushing many elder customers to queue outside the bank, according to Xinmin Evening News. Other banks in Shanghai also had similar policies. A news report said the elderly have to rely on offline banking for daily transactions because they are unfamiliar with smartphone banking. Even with the quota restrictions, people refused to leave, hoping to wait for a new round of tickets to get their savings and pension from their accounts, it said. The Shanghai headquarters of the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, issued a notice on June 9 and asked banks to streamline their cash withdrawal and pension payment procedures for the elderly. It said PBC has also increased its cash allocation by four times from June 1 to 15 as compared to last year. Annie Lab was unable to confirm if the video used by Spotlight on China is their original footage or sourced from somewhere else. But we did find similar scenes showing old people queuing outside banks in other news reports including Knews, Xinmin Evening News, and Sina Finance. They all said the elderly lined up outside the Postal Savings Bank of China because branches in Shanghai have quota restrictions. They did not mention anything about virus-contaminated cash. Low chances of COVID-19 infection through banknotes Banks such as Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Construction Bank told Annie Lab that they have not received any complaints regarding infection through banknotes. The Shanghai anti-epidemic requirements banks need to follow do not mention banknote transmission, either. The chances of catching the coronavirus by way of handling cash are smaller than by breathing in virus-laden droplets or aerosols, according to a study conducted in 2020 by the Bank of England. It found the level of the virus on a banknote declined rapidly over time. The virus on the note can still be detected within 24 hours but only at a very low level. The World Health Organization has not warned people against the use of cash during the pandemic, according to an article by the U.K.-based fact-checking organization Full Fact. Many banks in Shanghai are reported to have carried out extensive anti-epidemic measures before the resumption of services. Shanghai Securities News wrote disinfection of the environment and temporary isolation spots for visitors who showed COVID-19 symptoms are seen among banks. Some banks also have policies to sterilize the banknotes before circulation as a cautionary measure. China Merchants Bank, for example, uses UV lamps on cash to prevent cross-contamination during the handling process.",

        "doc": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share \u201cThe Trump administration has awarded more than $50 billion in new federal contracts to companies that continue to shutter U.S. factories as they seek cheaper labor abroad.\u201d \u2014 tweet by Indiana Democratic Party, Feb. 5 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight We spotted this tweet and followed a link to an opinion article that attacked President Trump for betraying American voters for failing to take action against companies that offshore U.S. jobs. The article, by Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of labor-backed Good Jobs Nation, cited a study by the group that included the statistic in the tweet. We wondered about this claim, given that we had recently concluded that the president had \"some bragging rights\u201d to boast about companies returning jobs to the United States. Good Jobs Nation has promoted its study with tweets similar to the one above, labeling Trump as \u201cOffshorer-in-chief.\u201d Advertisement So let\u2019s take a look at the study that formed the basis of the tweet. The Facts The Good Jobs Nation report, titled \u201cBroken Promise #2,\u201d was issued in August. It noted that Trump had pledged on \u201cday one\u201d to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to stop. It\u2019s so easy,\u201d he said at a campaign rally Nov. 7, 2016. But the report, by George Faraday, legal and policy director for Good Jobs Nation, argues that the president has failed to crack down on companies that feast on big U.S. contracts and yet continue to ship some jobs overseas. The Labor Department has a program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), originally enacted in the 1960s to assist workers whose jobs were displaced by free trade agreements. Faraday studied the jobs certified as being shipped to another country and then crosschecked with data on federal contract awards posted on usaspending.gov. (Correction: an earlier version of this article said TAA dated to the enactment of North American Free Trade Agreement; there was a related program called the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program.) Advertisement He concluded that, as of June 8, major contractors had earned $52 billion contracts and had shipped more than 13,000 jobs offshore. Most of the list consists of 12 companies that received about $48 billion in contracts, with the biggest job losers led by General Motors, Boeing, United Technologies and Siemens. In a recent blog post, Faraday provided updated numbers, as of Jan. 24: $115 billion in federal contracts and 15,000 jobs shipped overseas. The overall numbers add up in the report and a spot check of the data indicates it is sound. (We have questions about the yearly rate data, putting Trump at a disadvantage, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this fact check.) So what\u2019s wrong? It provides only half of the picture. We had noted before that data from the Reshoring Initiative shows that companies started to return jobs to the United States \u2014 or other countries invested in the United States \u2014 during the Obama administration, but the trend really started to pick up in 2017. About 73,000 jobs were brought to the United States in 2015, 113,000 in 2016 and 171,000 in 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office. That\u2019s a gain of more than 50 percent between 2016 and 2017. Advertisement Looking at the TAA numbers, one sees a similar decline in workers who were certified as having lost jobs because they were shipped overseas. We calculated there were 126,165 lost in 2016, Obama\u2019s last year in office, and then 85,482 lost in 2017 and 78,514 lost in 2018. Obama had two better years, in 2014 and 2015, but otherwise overall losses were higher in every other year of his administration \u2014 including 214,125 in 2010 and 244,617 in 2009. Certainly the pattern of the past three years shows fewer jobs are being shipped overseas. Combined with more jobs being returned, that\u2019s a pretty positive trend line. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting point,\u201d acknowledged Faraday, but he said the group was focused on the losses, not the gains. \u201cWe\u2019re labor, and that how\u2019s we see the world.\u201d He said it was important that the jobs be returned to the communities that had lost them. Advertisement Faraday noted that the focus of the report was on companies that benefited from U.S. contracts. He said that Trump could have taken action, via an executive order, to punish companies that shipped jobs overseas but that the president had failed to do so. The top executives of five companies that had offshored jobs, according to the TAA data, were members of Trump\u2019s American Manufacturing Council, which the president later disbanded. Still, a number of companies on the list have also said they will bring jobs back from overseas or add jobs in the United States, according to news reports. AT&T, for instance, is listed in Faraday\u2019s report as offshoring 270 jobs since Trump became president. Yet in 2017, the company announced an agreement with the Communications Workers of America to bring back 3,000 jobs that had been sent to Mexico. (The CWA, in a report in January, charged that the company has continued to close call centers in the United States and lay off workers.) \u201cAT&T is abiding by our agreement for hiring in the Southwest, but still continues laying off workers and offshoring throughout the company,\u201d said Beth Allen, a CWA spokeswoman. The Pinocchio Test As regular readers know, context is important. If the glass is half full, you can\u2019t look at only the empty part. A more balanced presentation in the report would include the jobs that have been returned from overseas, not just the ones that are lost.

        "doc": "On 31 October 2017, the disreputable web siteFreedum Junkshunpublished a fake news article claiming that two of Hillary Clinton\u2019s employees were arrested for destroying evidence related to a probe launched by House Republicans in response to several Trump allegations: Hillary Clinton is really worried about something. On Monday afternoon, FBI and local law enforcement surrounded a Clinton Foundation office in Ettleboro, North Dakota. Recently, Hillary Clinton was ordered by Congress to preserve all records related to her sale of Uranium to Russia when she was Secretary of State, and law enforcement received a tip that some of her underlings were not obeying that order. Breitbart News reports: Authorities arrested Jon Crawford, 23, and Elizabeth Palmer, 27, for allegedly tampering with evidence. The FBI received a tip from within the Clinton Foundation office that some staffers were shredding documents and that two hard drives had been taken from the office in defiance of the order from the Congressional Committee. There are a number of ways to tell that this story is a work of fiction. For one,theBreitbartarticle cited byFreedum Junkshundoes not exist. The web site linked toBreitbart\u2019shome page, not a specific article, and our search for news about the arrest of \u201cJon Crawford\u201d and \u201cElizabeth Palmer\u201d onBreitbartcame up empty handed. Second, the image purportedly showing two Clinton employees getting arrested for destroying evidence is actually several years old. The earliest posting of this photograph we could uncover came from the \u201cPopular Resistance\u201d Twitter account on 3 November 2014 and purportedly shows two people getting arrested during a protest against theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission: Homeland Security arrests protestors from #FERCblockade! They should arrest @FERC because #fercdoesntwork pic.twitter.com/TfnWtSocAF \u2014 Popular Resistance (@PopResistance) November 3, 2014 Lastly,Freedum Junkshun isa well-known fake news web site that has a history of publishing misinformation. The web sitecarries a \u201csatire\u201d tag in the footer of the web site and states in its \u201cAbout\u201d section that all of their articles should be considered fictitious: Freedom Crossroads uses facts that don\u2019t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today\u2019s aging conservative.

        "doc": "On 28 February 2017, the Underground Report web site published an article positing that a Florida drug trafficker who had been pardoned by President Obama was re-arrested three months later on charges that he had murdered his girlfriend: Just 94 days ago, James G. Winters of Gainesville, FL was pardoned from a life sentence by former President Barack Obama. Yesterday Winters was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend, Joanna Walker. Walker was reported missing by family early last week. Her body was discovered on Sunday, in the trunk of an abandoned 1998 Toyato Corrola in an Orlando Publix parking lot. Though the tags were removed the car was traced by to Winters and Officers made the subsequent arrest, booking Winters on one count of first degree murder. During his presidency, Obama granted pardons or clemency to an unprecedented 1,927 criminals. James Winters was serving a life sentence for drug trafficking and weapons charges. None of this was true. No one by the name of James G. Winters was pardoned by President Obama or arrested on murder charges in Florida in February 2017. The photograph of \u201cJames G. Winters\u201d that accompanied the article was actually a picture of a man named Avery Draughty, who was arrested in California in March 2015 and charged with a killing that had taken place over a year earlier. The only source reporting this information was the Underground Report, a known fake news site. So known, in fact, that at the foot of every article the site\u2019s creation has since added a link to a page explaining his deliberate spread of fabricated reports (and the public\u2019s reception of them): When I started this [fake news] site, I had no idea that the stories would garner this much attention. While writing them, I was aiming for stories that no one would believe, but rather would be satirical in an age where disinformation is so prevalent. Just for fun, I decided to post some of the stories in Trump fan groups on Facebook to see the reactions. To my surprise, the Trump masses embraced my stories as fact, almost universally. It seemed that there wasn\u2019t anything I could write that was too wild or outrageous to be believed by this particular audience. If I wrote about CNN being fake news and connected to ISIS, readers would agree wholeheartedly with my fabricated article. If I wrote about a black liberal or Obama supposedly saying something controversial, the response was unbridled racism and hatred. When I wrote about Hillary Clinton\u2019s new emails that proved she was a child sacrificing maniac, people screamed for her head.",

        "doc": "The day after the 2020 presidential election was called for Joe Biden, the communications director for Donald Trump's campaign tweeted a photo of a newspaper front page announcing Al Gore's victory 20 years earlier to highlight an alleged mistake by journalists reporting on results. But, the Washington Times said the photo had been \"doctored,\" and the original correctly described George W. Bush as the 2000 presidential election winner. \"Greeting staff at @TeamTrump HQ this morning, a reminder that the media doesn't select the President,\" Tim Murtaugh tweeted on November 8, 2020. Two photos were attached to the tweet. One showed an image of a front page of The Washington Times that read: \"PRESIDENT GORE,\" followed by: \"Florida pushes Gore over the top with bare majority.\" The second showed dozens of copies of the image on the walls of the Trump campaign headquarters. Screenshot of a doctored Washington Times front page, taken on November 8, 2020 The tweet was later deleted, but screenshots of the photo of the front page remained and were shared on other social media platforms, including on Facebook.

The original copy that was falsified read: \"PRESIDENT BUSH,\" followed by: \"Florida pushes Texan over the top with bare majority,\" according to a photo by a Twitter user who said they had a physical copy. Screenshot of a tweet taken on November 8, 2020 However, other printed versions of the November 8, 2000 Washington Times edition featured the headlines \"No President Yet,\" and \"Down to the Wire.\" Screenshot of a tweet taken on November 8, 2020 Screenshot of a tweet taken on November 8, 2020 The falsified headline tweeted by Murtaugh was based on the \"PRESIDENT BUSH\" version, as it is the only one that reports 207 seats for House Republicans, and 189 for House Democrats. While the headline was doctored in the image tweeted by Murtaugh, other text on the front page was not, CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski pointed out on Twitter. One article read: \"George W. Bush, the son of the president who was vanquished by the Clinton-Gore team eight years ago, avenged his father early this morning by defeating Al Gore, creating only the second father-son presidential dynasty in history.\" Also Read: Social Media Posts Claim Michigan County Vote Count Glitch Was A Fraud False calls did happen in 2000 On the night of November 7, 2000, news organizations including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and the Associated Press predicted Democrat Al Gore had won the race. But Bush's victory was eventually called by most media on November 8. An agonizingly long recount in the key battleground state of Florida was eventually halted by the US Supreme Court weeks later, definitively giving the presidency to Republican Bush.

        "claim": "\"A black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail.\"",
        "doc": "Several 2016 presidential candidates in both parties have discussed how the criminaljustice system might be improved. The latest to address this issue was Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during a June 11, 2015, interview on PBS. \"A black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail. This is (an) unspeakable tragedy.\" When we took a closer look, we found that the statistic may not be far off -- but it\u2019s hard to know for sure, because the data Sanders relies onis so old. As with other dramatic talking points we\u2019ve seen over the years, this one has been repeated and repeated over a decade and a half without being updated, despite evidence that the underlying trends have changed direction. The statistic dates back to a 2003 paper published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the U.S. Justice Department. The Bureau of Justice Statistics paper includes the line, \"About 1 in 3 black males ... are expected to go to prison during their lifetime, if current incarceration rates remain unchanged.\" By contrast, the paper said, one of every six Hispanic males and one of every 17 white males can be expected to go to prison during their lifetime. (For this fact-check, we\u2019ll ignore Sanders\u2019 imprecise use of \"jail,\" where people are held temporarily, rather than \"prison,\" where inmates are typically serving substantial sentences.) Not only was this data published 12 years ago, but the paper is based on data from 2001 -- a full 14 years ago. Despite its age, the statistic has been cited repeatedly -- notably in 2013 with the publication of a report by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform and promotes alternatives to incarceration. That report\u2019s claim -- that \"if current trends continue, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime\" -- was footnoted to a 2011 paper by Marc Mauer, the Sentencing Project\u2019s executive director. When we contacted Mauer, he said he doesn\u2019t know of any updated research that would shed light on the percentage today. \"It's a very complex analysis to produce, so that's at least part of the reason that it hasn't been replicated in recent years,\" Mauer said. We did, however, find reason to believe that the trend line that had been assumed in the 2003 paper has changed course. According to annual Justice Department reports, in 2001 there were 3,535 sentenced black male prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction for every 100,000 black male residents. By 2013, the equivalent number was 2,805. So black incarceration rates were 21 percent lower in 2013 than they were in 2001. That said, there\u2019s little doubt that black men have disproportionately higher incarceration rates. For instance, a study published in the journal Crime & Delinquency found that nearly half of black males and almost 40 percent of white males in the United States have been arrested by the age of 23. But because of the complexities of modeling the statistics, Mauer said, it\u2019s hard to know how much the decline in incarceration rates would specifically change the one-in-three statistic Sanders used. \"We can't necessarily say that the one-in-three figure should be reduced by 21 percent, although if we did, it would bring it down to about 1 in 4, which is still quite dramatic,\" Mauer said. Our ruling Sanders said that \"a black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail.\" This calculation, while it\u2019s the most recent one available, is 14 years old, and changes in the underlying data suggest that the actual odds of incarceration may be somewhat smaller today. Still, other evidence suggests that blacks have a disproportionate likelihood of ending up in prison. On balance we rate it Mostly True.",

        "claim": "\"If we increase fuel efficiency standards to 40, 45 miles a gallon, we would have to import zero oil from the Middle East.\"",
        "doc": "Obama's Mideast oil claim, made to the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees on June 26, is artful sleight-of-hand. He relies on an extremely optimistic (and possibly unrealistic) notion that the U.S. fleet would average 40-45 mpg at some point in the near future. He does not specify whether he means 40-45 mpg in the equivalent of today's tests (which would mean on-road performance much lower) or if he means on-road. Since he used the testing standard before, we'll assume the same here, which would equate to 35 mpg in the real world. At 35 mpg, Schipper estimates fuel usage could be reduced by about 40 percent. Instead of simply saying it would reduce fuel use by 40 percent, Obama shrewdly plays on the belief by many Americans that the U.S. is heavily dependent on Mideast oil. \"Contrary to popular belief, we don't import a lot of oil from the Middle East,\" saidsaid John DeCicco, a senior fellow for automotive strategies with the advocacy group Environmental Defense. In fact, the U.S. gets less than 20 percent of its imported oil from the Mideast, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. gets almost twice as much oil from Canada than it gets from Saudi Arabia. Obama is correct that a reduction in oil demand because of more fuel efficient cars could theoretically eliminate the need to import any oil from the Mideast. But he ignores the reality of global petroleum markets. \"It's not correct to say that we can specify where we buy our oil,\" Schipper said. \"Oil goes into one big world barrel.\" Obama's comment \"if we import zero oil from the Middle East, that means the gas prices are going to go down at the pump\" is a bit of a stretch. Given the volatility of oil prices and the time it, the price at the pump might still go up because of other factors. But under his scenario, it would go up less.",

        "doc": "About this rating On April 11, 2023, Foxx experienced what his daughter Corinne referred to in a since-deleted Instagram post as being a \"medical complication.\" As of June 5, no further specifying information about Foxx's private health matter had been announced by him, close family members, or any of his representatives. We will update this story should any clarifying details be released in the future. In early June 2023, readers sent us questions that asked about an unsubstantiated rumor that said entertainer Jamie Foxx had become paralyzed and blind after experiencing a blood clot from a COVID-19 vaccination. This claim stemmed from genuine news that Foxx had been hospitalized in April in what was referred to at the time as being a \"medical complication.\" Here's the bottom-line: As of June 5, no specific details had been released yet by Foxx, close family members, or any of his representatives that would further explain the kind of private health incident he had experienced nearly two months earlier. We emailed two publicists associated with Foxx to ask questions about the rumor but had not yet received a reply as of several hours later. We will add their responses to this story if they provide any information. Before we discuss the rumor's origins, we will first document several key dates with a timeline for context. This story began on April 12 when Foxx's daughter, Corrine, wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post that her father had \"experienced a medical complication yesterday.\" Her post continued: \"Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery. We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time.\" The \"CBS Mornings\" TV show broadcast a screenshot of the post before it disappeared: Actor Jamie Foxx is recovering after he \"experienced a medical complication\" on Tuesday, according to his daughter. She did not provide many details, but said quick action and great care are helping him on his way to recovery. pic.twitter.com/Ifdv1Gj4OF \u2014 CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) April 13, 2023 In the days prior to the \"medical complication,\"Foxx had reportedly been filming with fellow actor Cameron Diaz and other actors for a Netflix movie titled \"Back in Action,\" according to People.com. The film was scheduled to shoot scenes in Atlanta, Georgia. People.com also reported that he had been hospitalized in the same state. On May 3, an image was uploaded to Foxx's Instagram account that read, \"Appreciate all the love!!! Feeling blessed.\" The message included emojis of prayer hands, a heart, and a fox. A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) As of June 5, this was the only post made on Foxx's Instagram account since the time he had begun experiencing the unspecified health issue. On May 12, the Los Angeles Times reported that Corrine had issued another update about her father's condition. In her Instagram Stories, she responded to a screenshot of a headline that claimed, \"Jamie Foxx's Loved Ones Reportedly Preparing for the Worst.\" She wrote, \"Update from the family: Sad to see how the media runs wild. My dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating. In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone's prayers and support! We have an exciting work announcement coming next week too!\" The Geek Vibes Nation account captured a screenshot of the story: Jamie Foxx's daughter, Corrine Foxx, shuts down misinformation regarding her father's health \"Update from the family: Sad to see how the media runs wild.

Four days later, on May 16, former heavyweight boxing championMike Tyson appeared onPatrick Bet-David's \"PBD Podcast.\" At the 1:29:26 mark in the video, Bet-David asked Tyson, \"Mike, are you following what's going on with Jamie Foxx?\" Tyson answered, \"He's not feeling well.\" Bet-David responded with, \"Something's going on with...\" Tyson replied, \"Yeah, they said stroke. I have no idea what happened to him.\" Guest Adam Sosnick later asked, \"Has there even been any actual news on what this medical condition is? I mean, Jamie Foxx is a young, vibrant, healthy guy. And all of a sudden, boom.\" Tyson responded to Sosnick with, \"Hey, listen. If we don't know by now, they don't want us to know.\" On May 30, gossip columnist and podcaster A.J. Benza appeared on Dr. Drew Pinsky's podcast, \"Ask Dr. Drew.\" The episode was titled as, \"Jamie Foxx Health Scare: Is The COVID mRNA Booster To Blame? A.J. Benza Shares Exclusive \u2013 Ask Dr. Drew.\" At the 11:26 mark in the episode, Benza presented the idea that Foxx had become paralyzed and blind, purportedly from a blood clot that was caused by a COVID-19 vaccination. According to Benza, Foxx was \"pressured\" to get the vaccine. We transcribed Benza's remarks below: I worked my butt off to get a story about what happened to Jamie Foxx, because it was all baloney what they were reporting. \"He's playing pickleball. He's responding on Instagram.\" No he's not. People do that for you. It's all lies. I had somebody in the room who let me know that Jamie had a blood clot in his brain after he'd got the shot. He did not want the shot but the movie he was on, he was pressured to get it, this movie he's doing with Cameron Diaz. And I'm thinking, is that why he blew up on the set a week before this medical emergency happened? Is that why he fired three or four people? Because he just had had it with these mandates? I don't know, but what I found out from the man in the room was that the blood clot in the brain caused him at that point to be partially paralyzed and blind, because if you read into what they were saying early on, \"he's communicating with us\" ... that doesn't mean talking. That could be anything. It could be writing, sign l-... I know those little code words. And then when you tell me your father's playing pickleball, give me a break. You know, I don't know w-... There's a great shroud of secrecy around Jamie Foxx. He's probably the most multi-talented person we have in Hollywood, but even TMZ is not reporting this, and I know TMZ has got sources in hospitals who give them information, whether it's legal or not. But they're not... Mike Tyson got close. A week after I broke my story on my show, Mike Tyson said that Jamie had a blood clot in his brain. No one's gone that far to say that yet. Pinsky then responded to Benza, saying, \"It's been widely known that he had a stroke, right? I mean they've said stroke a hundred times.\" Again, as of this writing, there had been no official word from Foxx, close family members, or any of his representatives that would explain the \"medical complication\" he had experienced in April. On June 5, we asked Benza several questions in a direct message on Twitter. One of our questions was if he had any new details to share. He responded to us with the following: No, I have no additional information other than what my very reliable source gave me last week. What you should be doing is asking the Foxx family why Jamie isn't holding up his iPhone and telling his fans he's fine. I don't make things up. I've been at this for over 30 years. This story will be updated should any further details come to light. Note: Benza's mention of the \"he's communicating with us\" line appeared to come from a report filed by TMZ. ",

        "doc": "The 100+ mph winds of Typhoon Manghut destroyed homes, caused landslides, and left dozens of people dead when it swept across Southern China in mid-September 2018. As footage of the destruction started making its way online, millions of viewers came across a dramatic video which purportedly showed a DragonAir B-737 airliners being tossed about in the typhoon-force winds as it struggled to land at an airport: WATCH: Pilot amazingly saves his passengers\u2019 lives during a typhoon But this video was not real: it was a combination of computer-generated graphics and genuine footage of an unrelated airliner incident. The first segment of the video was created by \u201cMeniThings,\u201d a production company which specializes in CGI and frequently posts content about UFOs and alien encounters. This video was originally shared to YouTube under the title \u201cExtreme Crosswind | Airliner spins 360\u201d and filed under the \u201centertainment\u201d tag: Meni Tsirbas, the director and owner of MeniThings, confirmed that this portion of the video was CGI when he retweeted a message from @UFOInterest explaining how the video was made: The second portion of the video shows a real, albeit unrelated, incident that was filmed at Shenzhen airport in August 2018. Reuters reported that a passenger plane operated by Capital Airlines was en route from Beijing to Macao when it encountered wind shear and was forced to make an emergency landing. AIRLive.net also reported of the event that: Capital Airlines flight #JD5759 from Beijing to Macao was damaged in a hard landing attempt during windshear at Macao Airport. Parts of the nose gear broke away and hit the left engine during the landing attempt. The Airbus A320 (reg. B-6952) diverted to Shenzhen, where it landed safely. One of the airport\u2019s two runways was shut after emergency landing the other runway was operating normally. Five passengers were slightly injured.

        "doc": "Political partisans often rush to social media in the wake of a mass shooting with unfounded claims, memes, and half-baked theories attempting to show how the \u201cother side\u201d was responsible for the violence. In June 2019, after a 40-year-old man shot and killed a dozen people in a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va., a pair of rumors concerning his political affiliations were circulated on social media. The first rumor held that DeWayne Craddock was a \u201cblack Muslim\u201d, a claim we covered here. The other rumor, which we\u2019ll examine below, maintained that he was a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, wore a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d (MAGA) hat, and had a \u201c2020 Trump\u201d bumper sticker on his car: We found no basis for this claim, and the Facebook user who spread this rumor provided no news reports or any other documentation to support the assertion. When pressed in the comments to provide a source, the user responded with a mocking message imitating Trump\u2019s speech pattern: My sources are the best sources. I have the best people and the best sources. I am never wrong and I never lie. Anybody who disagrees with me is fake news. Believe only me. Only I can save you. You have no hope without me. I am your savior. I am a stable genius. Many people say I am a genius. Many fine people tell me that. . As of this writing, little is known about what motivated the Virginia Beach shooter. He didn\u2019t appear to have any social media presence, and he also didn\u2019t post any sort of manifesto online explaining his reasons for the attack. Police Chief James Cervera told USA Today that \u201cpolice don\u2019t have a motive at this point for the attack.\u201d Law enforcement have not indicated that Craddock\u2019s politics, or his religion for that matter, played a role in the shooting: Just why Craddock opened fire at the city\u2019s Department of Public Utilities Building 2, part of a sprawling municipal complex, where he held a mid-level engineering job for 15 years, remained a mystery a day after the massacre. He had not been fired, as some early reports had claimed; he left no explanatory note or online manifesto. In fact, he apparently shunned social media. He had no criminal record, other than a few traffic violations \u2014 and both the firearms he used Friday were legally obtained, officials said. It\u2019s no wonder that City Manager Dave Hansen called the deadly rampage \u201ca senseless, incomprehensible act of violence.\u201d",

        "claim": "India received highest ever FDI worth $ 64.37 billion in FY 2018-19 because of the path breaking reforms by the Modi Government.",
        "doc": "Recently, the government claimed that India received the highest ever FDI worth $64.37 billion in 2018-19. Here is a fact check of the claim. The official Twitter handle of Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) had on 31 July 2019, tweeted about the record Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2018-19, due to the reforms of Modi government. Here is a fact check of this claim. Claim: India received highest ever FDI worth $ 64.37 billion in FY 2018-19 because of the path breaking reforms by the Modi Government. Fact: The provisional FDI inflow figure for 2018-19 was initially estimated at $ 64.37 billion, but later revised to $ 62 billion. While these numbers are TRUE, these present only half the picture. The increase in FDI inflows is in continuation of the increasing trend witnessed over the past decade. Also the \u2018Net FDI\u2019 flow has witnessed a negative (decreasing trend). The FDI Inflows into India have witnessed a broad increasing trend As per the infographic in the tweet, the FDI received in 2018-19 was $ 64.37 billion. The infographic further states that the total FDI received over the last five years was $ 286 billion. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) publishes a quarterly report on the FDI. As per the report published at the end of June\u201919 quarter , the provisional figures for FDI received in 2018-19 was $ 62 billion. However, as per the report published for the previous quarter (Jan\u201919- Mar\u201919), the provisional FDI inflow for 2018-19 was estimated at $ 64.37 billion. In other words, the infographic quotes figures from the March report and not the latest report available for quarter ending June 2019. Though the broad figures in the tweet are true, it does not present the complete picture. The FDI inflows into India have broadly followed an increasing trend with minor dips in certain years. During the UPA\u2019s 10-year tenure, the FDI inflows increased from $4.32 billion in 2003-04 to $36.05 billion in 2013-14, an increase by more than 7 times. The highest ever FDI inflows during the UPA was in 2011-12 when India was the recipient of $ 46.56 billion worth FDI. This increasing trend is continued during the current government. The FDI inflows during the current government increased from $ 36.05 billion in 2013-14 to $ 62 billion in 2018-19. FDI includes both inflow and Outflow, with Net FDI providing a better reflection of state of Economy Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an investment made by a business entity belonging to one country into another country. FDI inflows refer to the investments received by into the country from the foreign investors. Similarly, FDI also includes an Outflow component which refers to the Investment made by the domestic investors into the business entities of other countries. The Net FDI is the offset between the Inflows and the Outflows, which provides a more accurate picture of the state of Country\u2019s Economy. The FDI inflow over the last five years, as indicated in the Infographic has indeed seen an increasing trend and the annual figures recorded are the highest ever received. However, this is in continuation of increasing trend in FDI inflows over the past decade as noted above. Another side to the FDI coin is the FDI outflow. This includes the Investment made by the Indian investors in business firms outside India, as well as the disinvestment i.e. the taking back of the investments made in a country by the foreign investors. Net FDI can be understood by a simple formula: Net FDI = Gross FDI Inflows \u2013 FDI outflow \u2013 disinvestment/repatriation The Net FDI has shown negative trend due to the increase in the FDI outflows as per Reserve Bank of India\u2019s data. Therefore, the claim that the increase in FDI inflows alone would contribute towards the economic growth, is not complete unless net FDI is factored in. Factly has earlier published two stories, on FDI trends, one about the FDI inflow over the past decade and the other one on sources of FDI & Net FDI , which can be referred to for further reading.",

        "claim": "\u201cRight now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car.\u201d",
        "doc": "Last year\u2019s soaring gasoline prices drove many Americans to consider electric vehicles as a cheaper alternative to paying at the pump. A recent Facebook post claims that\u2019s a misguided quest, and it\u2019s more expensive to drive an electric car than one with an internal combustion engine. \"Are you one of those people driving down the road past the gas station, smugly thinking \u2018at least I'm not paying for gas,\u2019\" said conservative radio host Erick Erickson in a video shared Jan. 27 on Facebook. \"Or do you think, \u2018At least I'm not destroying the planet so long as I don't think about the coal-fire plant powering my car,\u2019\" Erickson continued. Then, citing a post published by car blog Jalopnik, Erickson said, \"Right now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car.\" The video was excerpted from an episode of Erickson\u2019s podcast, on which he also claimed the U.S. government is driving up petroleum prices to push people toward electric cars, and that increasing dependence on renewable energy sources like solar and wind power will eventually spark an energy crisis. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The Jalopnik blog post Erickson mentioned refers to a report released in late January by Anderson Economic Group, which looked at fuel costs for midpriced vehicles and luxury cars from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022. Because of rising electricity costs, the report found that for the first time in 18 months, it was cheaper to fuel a midpriced internal combustion engine car than it was to charge an electric vehicle. The comparison did not hold true for luxury vehicles, though. The report said drivers of midpriced electric cars paid about $11.60 to charge their vehicles at home for 100 miles of driving. Drivers who used commercial charging stations paid about $14.49. By comparison, drivers of similarly priced internal combustion engine cars paid about $11.29 in fuel costs for 100 miles of driving. Fuel costs were higher for luxury cars. For those vehicles, electric car owners paid about $12.40 for at-home charging and about $15.95 for commercial charging for 100 miles of driving. Those with internal combustion engine vehicles paid about $19.96. The Anderson Economic Group calculated the costs based on the price of the underlying energy \u2014 such as gas, diesel and electricity \u2014 excise taxes, the cost of operating a fuel pump or charging station and driving to a fueling station. But the group\u2019s conclusions and methodology have critics. Car and Driver magazine pointed out the report based its fuel, electricity and tax costs on prices in Michigan. Each of the costs vary by state, but the study did not account for this: Another criticism of the study is that it didn\u2019t account for electric vehicles\u2019 impact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Although the report acknowledged the \"environmental costs of different types of vehicles,\" it focused solely on the cost of fueling. Car and Driver said calculating the environmental costs between electric and internal combustion engine cars may be difficult, but focusing only on fuel costs \"feels disingenuous.\" Estimates vary for the environmental benefits of an electric car, but the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization, found in 2015 that, regardless of its electricity source, an electric car produces less than half of the greenhouse gas emissions of a similarly sized internal combustion engine car. Several estimates found that after being driven for 15,000 to 20,000 miles, an electric car reaches the point of offsetting the carbon emissions made by its production. Anderson Economic Group\u2019s report also didn\u2019t account for the difference in maintenance costs between electric and internal combustion engine cars. In 2020, Consumer Reports found that it costs about half as much to maintain electric cars because they have \"fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines, and they don\u2019t require fluid changes.\" The organization compared nine electric cars priced at less than $50,000 that were popular in 2020 with three comparable internal combustion engine vehicles. It found the lifetime ownership cost for electric cars was $6,000 to $10,000 cheaper than their gas-powered counterparts. We contacted Erickson for comment. He acknowledged our query on Twitter but did not respond to the request for comment. Citing a post by car blog Jalopnik, Erickson said, \"Right now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car.\" The claim was based on a study conducted by the Anderson Economic Group, which found that from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, for midpriced vehicles, it was more expensive to charge an electric car than to fuel one with an internal combustion engine. But the comparison did not hold true for luxury vehicles. And the report didn\u2019t account for differing costs across the nation for fuel, electricity and taxes. It also did not factor in other points of cost comparison between the vehicles, such as maintenance and environmental costs. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.",

(Representational Image) Have Mumbai police issued an advisory against a gang of robbers for residents between Malad and Dahisar? A viral social media post claims that a group of 15-20 miscreants are on the loose in these parts of the megapolis, and asks residents not to open their doors at night if they hear a baby crying outside. The post claims that the message has been received from Dahisar senior police inspector Ramkant Patil. India Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA), however, has found it to be a hoax. In fact, there is no officer by the name of Ramkant Patil posted at Dahisar police station. On June 24, Facebook user Pooja Mehta uploaded a post that says, A group of 15-20 people, including women and children, are active between Malad and Dahisar. They are armed. Please do not open the door at night or any other time if you hear a baby crying outside. The archived version of this post can be seen here. Other Facebook users have shared the post along with videos. One such post by Arpan Kothari shows CCTV footage and a press conference by a police officer. While the CCTV footage shows a few men and women talking and climbing the stairs of a building, the police officer speaks about some arrests. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Facebook user Jigna Dhanak uploaded another video containing CCTV footage different from the earlier video. This post too had the same claim of the message being forwarded by Ramkant Patil. CCTV footage in this video shows a woman being attacked by a man. AFWA searched the Internet to find incidents in Malad or Dahisar where a group of 15-20 armed people, including women, robbed houses using crying children as baits. But we could not find even one such incident. AFWA then looked through the website of Mumbai police. There is a list of senior police inspectors in charge of every police station. The name of senior police inspector of Dahisar police station is Vasant Narayan Pingle. AFWA spoke to Pingle who said, This post has been viral for the last one-and-a-half years. People keep asking me and I keep telling them it\u2019s fake. I have been posted in Dahisar police station since August 4, 2017. Before me, there was an officer named Subhash Sawant in my position. He was here for one-and-a-half years. Before him, another officer named Prakash Jadhav served here for two years in this position. No one here has heard of a senior police inspector named Ramkant Patil in several years. AFWA also checked the videos that have been posted along with the viral claims. The post with CCTV footage and press conference by a police officer is actually about an incident unrelated to the viral claim. Dahisar police had arrested 13 people, including two women, who had raided the house of a real estate agent by posing as income tax officers. News about the incident can be seen here. CCTV footage in the other post shows a man following a woman into a building lift and subsequently attacking her when she tries to get out. Neighbours come to the rescue of the woman and the attacker is caught. This clearly has nothing to do with the viral claim of a group of 15-20 people robbing a house with weapons. (With inputs from Shivshankar Tiwari) INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim A group of 15-20 armed people are on the loose in certain Mumbai localities.

        "claim": "Photo of Malaysian prison officers waiting to take ex-PM Najib Razak to jail in August 2022",
        "doc": "The picture was shared on Twitter here on August 23, 2022, where it has been retweeted more than 1,100 times. It shows a man wearing a helmet and a jacket that reads \"Prison\" in Malay standing next to a motorcycle and watching a black car pull into an entranceway. The post\u2019s caption, written in Malay and English, states: \u201cPrison officers already standby outside the court. Get your camera ready folks. This may be the day Najib almost got away.! This may be the best Independence Day present to our nation!\" It circulated on the same day that Malaysia's highest court upheld former prime minister Najib Razak's 12-year jail sentence for corruption in the 1MDB financial scandal, saying his appeal was \"devoid of any merit\". According to Malaysian newspaper The Star, Najib was sent from the Federal Court to the Kajang Prison. A lower court had earlier sentenced Najib after finding the former prime minister guilty of abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust over the transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10 million) from SRC International, a former unit of state fund 1MDB, to his personal bank account. The picture was also shared on Twitter here and here, and on Facebook here and here. The claim, however, is false. A reverse image search on Google and subsequent keyword searches found the photo was shared on Facebook here on June 2, 2015, by Wan Azizah Wan Ismail -- a Malaysian politician who would later become deputy prime minister in 2018. The post's Malaysian-language caption reads: \"The vehicle carrying DSAI has arrived at HKL with very strict controls.\" DSAI refers to her husband, the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, with his honorifics Dato Seri, while HKL refers to Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Below is a screenshot comparison of the picture in the misleading post (L) and the genuine picture from Wan Azizah's Facebook post (R): Anwar, then serving a jail sentence for sodomy, was transferred from the Sungai Buloh Prison and admitted to the hospital for medical treatment, as reported by The Sun Daily, a local newspaper, on the same day. AFP geolocated the picture to this spot at Kuala Lumpur Hospital, which was captured in November 2015 via Google Maps. Below is a screenshot comparison of the picture in the misleading post (L) and the location on Google Maps dated November 2015 (R), with similarities highlighted by AFP: Nanyang Siang Pau, a Chinese-language newspaper in Malaysia, also shared the same photo in a Facebook post about Anwar's hospital admission on June 2, 2015. The picture was also used in a Facebook post from the Seremban Prison on February 6, 2020, titled: \"Malaysian Prison Department's Motorcycle Escort Unit.\" Local newspaper Harian Metro has also debunked the claim the photo shows prison officers waiting for Najib outside court here.",

        "claim": "Says the federal agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid will disburse $803 billion in benefits this year, making \"it larger than all but 15 of the world's economies.\"",
        "doc": "Republicans balked at President Barack Obama's July decision to appoint the top federal administrator for Medicaid and Medicare without a congressional hearing, saying Congress deserved the chance to quiz the appointee, Donald Berwick, on how he intends to manage the federal behemoth called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Later that month, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chimed in with a financial reason he wishes Berwick had undergone a public grilling: \"The CMS will disburse $803 billion in benefits this fiscal year, which makes it larger than all but 15 of the world\u2019s economies.\" The U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, which publishes policy papers for GOP senators to consider, had said as much weeks earlier. McCaul serves on a similar panel advising House Republicans. We wondered whether McCaul's international comparison was on point. In its cost estimates for fiscal 2010, CMS notes that it distributes \"more benefits than any other federal agency\" \u2014 $803.1 billion in this fiscal year that runs through September. A CMS spokeswoman told us that figure still holds. Mike Rosen, a McCaul spokesman, pointed us to the International Monetary Fund, which publishes a report twice a year \u2014 most recently in April \u2014 analyzing global economic developments, including data on inflation, unemployment and countries' gross domestic product. The IMF estimated that this year, the United States has the largest GDP among 182 other countries, $14.79 trillion, followed by China ($5.36 trillion), Japan ($5.27 trillion) and Germany ($3.32 trillion). By that yardstick, Rosen said, CMS's annual spending would rank 16th among those countries, behind Korea's gross domestic product ($991 billion) and ahead of the Netherlands ($797 billion). Paul Van de Water, an analyst at Washington's liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed the CMS would rank 16th \u2014 the new health care law has little effect on Medicare and Medicaid spending this year \u2014 but said the billions in benefits merit some perspective. \"The United States is a big country, and health care is much more expensive in the U.S. than anywhere else, so it's not surprising that health care for the elderly, disabled and poor costs a lot of money,\" Van de Water said. The United States has the world's third-largest population, according to the CIA World Factbook, behind China and India. \"U.S. government spending on national defense and homeland security will total about $750 billion this year; that number exceeds a lot of foreign GDPs, too, but the comparison provides no information about appropriate defense policy.\" Van de Water said a more reasonable benchmark is the size of the U.S. economy. CMS \"estimates that total health care spending in the U.S., for all people and programs, in calendar year 2010 will equal 17.3 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product,\" he said. \"Of that amount, federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to equal 5.3 percent of GDP.\" Defense spending: also about 5 percent. Thomas Saving, an economist and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University, agreed the GDP comparison would be more valuable. He noted that total health care expenditures in Japan, which has the world's the third-largest GDP, are about 9 percent of its GDP \u2014 or about half the U.S. ratio. Saving said McCaul's \"comparison has no useful information,\" pointing out that the population of the smaller economies are tiny when compared to the populations in countries with the largest GDPs \u2014 or states, for that matter. \"Another not useful fact is that (national) CMS benefits are smaller than the Texas state GDP,\" he added. \"Social Security benefits are 4.8 percent of the U.S. GDP \u2014 also larger than most of the world's economies,\" Saving said. \"We are a big country in population and a rich country in per-capita GDP. Offering a less critical take, Brian Blase, a health policy analyst from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said McCaul's comparison illustrates a bigger point: \"The U.S. spends an awful lot on health care, primarily on Medicaid and Medicare. We spend more (total) on health care for seniors and poor people than most of the other countries could spend if they spent all their income.\" However, Blase agreed McCaul's claim is \"somewhat misleading\" and said \"if you really want to do a comparison, you want to put it in per capita terms.\" How come? Gross numbers can be misleading without context. For instance, China recently passed Japan as the country with the second highest GDP, but it's \"nowhere close to as wealthy as Japan right now because Japan's population is a fraction of the population of China,\" he said. Rosen of McCaul's office stood by the congressman's statement in an e-mail: \"We were not comparing our health care expenditures to that of other countries... The numbers are the numbers. 16th is 16th.\" Our take? True, the CMS is poised to spend some $800 billion this year, more money than the size of all but 15 nations' economies. But this dramatic point isn't a meaningful comparison, because it lacks any context \u2014 such as spending per person \u2014 that puts the numbers in perspective. We rate McCaul's statement Half True.",

        "doc": "In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which gave Americans the constitutional right to an abortion, President Joe Biden's history on the issue has drawn renewed scrutiny.A Facebook post shared June 27 shows a screenshot of a tweet senior editor of The Federalist David Harsanyi shared with a link to a New York Times article titled \"When Joe Biden Voted to Let States Overturn Roe v. Wade.\"\"In 1982 Joe Biden proposes a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to choose their own policies on abortion,\" reads the tweet, which amassed over 10,000 likes since it published on June 24.The Facebook post generated 3,000 shares in less than a week. Similar posts have amassed hundreds of interactions on Facebook and Twitter.But the claim is off the mark.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, introduced the constitutional amendment to overturn Roe v. Wade in 1981, not Biden. Biden did vote in favor of it in 1982, however.USA TODAY reached out to social media users who shared the claim for comment.Hatch introduced the amendment in 1981, according to congress.gov. The amendment would have granted \"concurrent power to Congress and the States to restrict and prohibit abortions\" and \"declares that the Constitution does not secure a right to abortion.\"Biden, then a senator and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted in favor of the amendment in committee in March 1982, according to the New York Times. He said the vote was \u201cthe most difficult one he had made as a senator and that, as a Roman Catholic, he was not sure that he had 'a right to impose' his views on an issue that would affect the entire nation,\" the Times reported.Fact check: Biden once said he 'never believed' gun control, federal registration would reduce crimeThe proposal failed to advance to the full Senate. Hatch introduced a second amendment in 1983 that again declared that \"a right to abortion is not secured by the Constitution,\" but Biden changed his stance and voted against it, according to archived congressional records.Biden's views on abortion have fluctuated over the years. He told the Washingtonian in a 1974 interview that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling \"went too far\" and he didn't think \"a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.\"But in 2012, President Barack Obama tweeted a direct quote from Biden, then the vice president, on abortion that said, \"I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people, women, that they can\u2019t control their bodies.\u201dAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, Biden said, \"The health and life of women in this nation are now at risk,\" USA TODAY reported.Based on our research, we rate PARTLY FALSE the claim that Biden proposed a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe v. Wade in 1982. Biden did vote in favor of that amendment initially, but he's not the one who proposed it. And Biden voted against the same amendment when it resurfaced a year later.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

        "claim": "According to the Census Bureau, \u201c5 million more people voted than were registered to vote\u201d in the 2020 election.",
        "doc": "In the race to fill the U.S. Senate seat now held by retiring Republican Rob Portman, all but one of the candidates for the Republican nomination cast suspicion on the 2020 presidential election. At a recent debate, businessman Mike Gibbons, a top contender, repeated a favored talking point. \"Five million more people voted than were registered to vote,\" Gibbons said March 28. \"And that\u2019s according to the U.S. Census Bureau. There\u2019s a problem. We need to investigate it. The Jan. 6 commission should be investigating that instead of some sort of false accusation of some sort of insurrection.\" Gibbons is wrong. No numbers back up his claim of 5 million more votes cast than there were people registered to vote. We\u2019ve checked iterations of this statement before and found them false. Gibbons\u2019 invocation of the Census Bureau failed to improve his accuracy. The Census Bureau reported in April 2021 that its surveys found 168,308,000 registered voters, and 154,628,000 votes cast in the 2020 election. Neither is an exact figure; these estimates are based on people\u2019s answers to survey questions. But since Gibbons name checked the Census Bureau, it\u2019s worth noting that, according to the bureau, there were at least 13 million more registered voters than people who voted. That\u2019s the opposite of what Gibbons asserted as fact. Gibbons spoke as if the Census Bureau was the gold standard for election results. But data collected from the states gives a more accurate picture of the number of registered voters and the number of ballots cast. In its latest report to Congress, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission said numbers sent to them by state election officials showed there were 209,441,338 active registered voters in 2020, more than the Census Bureau found. \"Active\" registered voters includes people who meet every requirement to walk into a polling station and cast a ballot. Finding that number nationwide isn\u2019t as simple as it might seem. Not every state automatically reports the distinction between people who have voted recently and those who haven\u2019t in a long time and need to reconfirm their address and voting status before they can vote. University of Georgia political scientist Trey Hood said there can be other complications in working with state data. \"Some states have same-day registration during early voting, or Election-Day registration,\" Hood said. \"Some of these figures may not get lumped in with existing registrants, depending on how the state records these statistics.\" The commission\u2019s questionnaire to state election officials aimed to cut through the clutter and capture the truest estimate of the people ready and eligible to vote. As for how many actually voted, the commission reported 161,303,109 ballots cast. There are other wrinkles to the data. Not every ballot included a vote for president. University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald estimated that the figure for the presidential election could be closer to 158,407,000. Readers might find other numbers, based on earlier reporting and preliminary statistics, but in every case, the number of people who voted is many millions less than the number of people registered to vote. Based on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s work, there were about 48 million fewer votes cast than the number of registered voters, meaning than in total, Gibbons was off by about 53 million. Gibbons said that according to the Census Bureau, \"5 million more people voted than were registered to vote\" in the 2020 election. Contrary to what Gibbons said, the Census Bureau estimated that 13 million fewer people voted than were registered to vote. That was based on statistical sampling in a survey. The U.S. Election Commission worked directly with state election officials and found that 43 million fewer people voted than were registered to vote. That report came out last year.

        "claim": "People with the COVID-19 vaccine are being \"tracked in real time via 5G cellular, and all that data can be hacked into to track you.\"",
        "doc": "A video shared by a radio host resurfaces a previously debunked claim that vaccines contain a microchip allowing a person to be tracked through the 5G cellular network. Hal Turner posted a four-minute Russian-language video with English subtitles to his website on May 20 allegedly showing a programmer hacking into a leaked database for Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine. \"Claim: Vaccinated People Are Being TRACKED in Real Time via 5G Cellular, and all that data can be hacked-into to track YOU,\" the post\u2019s headline reads. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the video, the programmer claims he\u2019s able to use the database to access information that\u2019s been transmitted over the 5G cellular network from a microchip that was injected into a vaccinated person. The information allegedly showed the person\u2019s real-time location, that he was currently asleep at the time and the microchip\u2019s current firmware. \"We know that our government is doing stuff like mass jabs and not everything is as they tell us,\" the man says. Turner said he doesn't know what to make of the video and that he has no knowledge of the claim\u2019s \"possibility or its impossibility.\" Despite his reservations, Turner said the video was compelling enough for him to share it on his site. Versions of this claim have repeatedly been checked by PolitiFact and other media organizations. There have been no reports of a database leak or hack related to the Sputnik V vaccine, and there is no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips. In fact, microchips are too big for the syringes used in administering the vaccine and other immunizations. The world's smallest microchip is 1 mm x 1 mm large, whereas the inner diameter of the needle typically used in vaccinations is about .41 mm, according to Nebraska Medicine, a nonprofit hospital affiliated with the University of Nebraska. Additionally, none of the ingredients listed for the Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Sputnik V suggests they have technology that can connect to a cellular network. Conspiracies about the vaccines containing microchips and being related to the 5G network have been persistent; it prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to include an entry in its COVID-19 vaccine FAQ that says they don\u2019t contain microchips. \"There may be trackers on the vaccine shipment boxes to protect them from theft, but there are no trackers in the vaccines themselves,\" the agency says. Turner posted a video on his website that claims to show a Russian hacker accessing information from a microchip that was injected into someone when they received a COVID-19 vaccination. That information can be used to track someone\u2019s movements. There is no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in use contain microchips or any ingredients with networking capabilities that allow people to be tracked. Similar claims about the vaccines have been debunked in the past. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",

Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject. \"I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation\u2019s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days,\" Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release.That\u2019s about three years.We grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject.But before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget.This is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years.If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.If a budget resolution doesn\u2019t pass, the federal government won\u2019t go dark.Budget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money. If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills.As a previous PolitiFact National story said, \"the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.\"Now, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson\u2019s claim is accurate.Last year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats \"passed\" a budget.LeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution.Indeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service.PolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn\u2019t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility.Let\u2019s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats \"have gone without any budget at all\" for more than 1,000 days.Ryan\u2019s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True.Isakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to \"submit\" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days.Democrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote. We took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress\u2019 proceedings.On April 26, 2010, under the heading \"Submitted Resolutions,\" is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He\u2019s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee.The resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission. A resolution is \"submitted\" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly\u2019s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress. Instead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time.In an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad\u2019s submission of the budget resolution as a \"gimmick.\"\"It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour,\" the email said.Federal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours.The Democrat-controlled Senate didn\u2019t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don\u2019t intend to put one up this year, either.Isakson\u2019s claim that the \"Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days\" needs some revision.No budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release.That said, this flaw in Isakson\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven\u2019t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions.The statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It meets our definition of Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next 10 years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true.\"",
        "doc": "Conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh dismissed climate change as the work of agenda-driven computer models spitting out threats that loom just beyond the horizon, where scientists can elude accountability for their dubious predictions. \"Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30,\" Limbaugh said on Fox News Sunday. \"Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true.\" What's not true, in this case, is what Limbaugh said. We'll explain why with the help of scientists. The first problem with Limbaugh\u2019s claim is this: Climate change is already happening. Its impact is seen around the world. Here\u2019s the topline: The broad scientific consensus is that human factors are the main contributor to global warming, with carbon dioxide emissions primarily driving up the earth\u2019s temperature, which are now at record levels. \"Utter nonsense,\" is how climate scientist Kevin Trenberth characterized Limbaugh\u2019s claim. \"We can simply look at the actual climate record,\" said Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \"The Earth is now hotter than it has ever been on record.\" The last four years were the hottest on record, according to an analysis by the World Meteorological Organization of five leading international datasets. In 2018, the oceans as a whole \u2014 which contain most of the earth\u2019s energy \u2014 were the hottest on record, according to an international panel of scientists who track the data. What\u2019s more, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s leading authority on climate change has concluded with high confidence that \"impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed.\" Last summer, the Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area of Norway was found to be 40 percent below average for that time of year, according to the Norwegian Ice Service, which tracks data going back to 1981. Scientists also point to an uptick in extreme weather. Trenberth noted that rainfalls are heavier in most places around the world, and that 2015 was the most active hurricane year globally on record. \"It\u2019s not just \u2018a bunch of computer models,\u2019 \" said Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. \"Climate change is visible in hundreds of independent observational data sets of land, ice, ocean, ecosystems.\" Limbaugh said climate predictions are always pegged to some distant future, \"when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true.\" But what about predictions from decades past? According to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist with Berkeley Earth, these older projections have largely been borne out. \"Broadly speaking, climate models have been quite skillful over the past 30 years in predicting warming in the years after they were published,\" said Hausfather, who assessed previous climate change models in an analysis for the website Carbon Brief. He cited the example of Columbia University scientist Wally Broecker, who in 1975 predictedglobal temperatures would rise due to increased CO2 emissions. \"Broecker predicted by 2010 the world would have warmed by around 0.74C,\" Hausfather said. \"In reality, it warmed by 0.62C, which is pretty good for a very rudimentary climate model in the 1970s.\" Scientists often focus on longer-term projections because a warming trend, relative to natural variability, can be seen more clearly from this timeframe, said John Reilly, a climate scientist at MIT. However, many climate models begin their simulations around 1850, and can project forward through the present day, and up to the year 2100. \"So there are projections for the present and next few years,\" Reilly said. Limbaugh said, \"Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true.\" First, global warming is already happening. Earth is the hottest it has ever been, and the impact is observable. Second, climate change predictions from decades past have largely been borne out. Third, models project further out because it helps show warming trends more clearly, relative to natural variability. But scientists also have near-term projections available. We rate this False. We updated this article on March 5, 2019, to make clear that the Earth is now hotter than it has ever been based onthe recordof the planet'smeasured climate.",

        "claim": "Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer helped former Barack Obama give an \"enemy of the U.S.\" $150 billion in cash.",
        "doc": "As President Donald Trump prepared on 8 January 2019 to deliver a televised speech to the nation making the case for billions of dollars to construct a wall along the roughly 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico, some social media users circulated an inaccurate meme containing the claim that the preceding Obama administration, with the help of Democratic lawmakers Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, had given Iran $150 billion in cash. President Trump battled Congress over his request for $5.7 billion to fulfill a 2016 campaign promise to \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d The resulting impasse over budget appropriations for the wall\u2019s construction led to a protracted shutdown of the federal government. As with many memes, the one above paired two topics that were unrelated to each other, along with a generous helping of inaccuracy. The \u201cenemy of the U.S.\u201d referred to Iran, which was never given a $150 billion cash payment by President Barack Obama with the help of Pelosi and Schumer. Instead, billions of dollars worth of Iranian assets were unfrozen as a result of the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated with that country, which had nothing to do with the U.S. federal budget or border wall construction. Trump floated the \u201c$150 billion\u201d figure in conjunction with his desired border wall construction in a 12 December 2018 Twitter post: The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can\u2019t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2018 The $150 billion figure is an estimate of the value of Iranian assets that were unfrozen as a result of Iran\u2019s agreeing to the terms of the nuclear agreement reached with seven nations in 2015, including the U.S., anagreement formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In other words, Iran gained access to assets that already belonged to them, assets that had been frozen in various financial institutions around the world due to sanctions imposed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But Iran didn\u2019t get $150 billion in cash, nor did they receive any money at all from U.S. taxpayers \u2014 they only regained access to assets that had been frozen in several different countries (not just the U.S.), and the $150 billion figure was merely an upper estimate. Moreover, that $150 billion figure was the highest estimate of the value of Iran\u2019s frozen assets, with multiple sources reporting much lower figures. For example, Adam J. Szubin, Acting Under Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, supplied written testimony to a U.S. Senate committee in August 2015 stating that U.S. assessment of the total liquid assets Iran would regain control of as a result of the nuclear agreement was \u201ca little more than $50 billion\u201d: We must also be measured and realistic in understanding what sanctions relief will really mean to Iran. Estimates of total Central Bank of Iran (CBI) foreign exchange assets worldwide are in the range of $100 to $125 billion. Our assessment is that Iran\u2019s usable liquid assets after sanctions relief will be much lower, at a little more than $50 billion. The other $50-70 billion of total CBI foreign exchange assets are either obligated in illiquid projects (such as over 50 projects with China) that cannot be monetized quickly, if at all, or are composed of outstanding loans to Iranian entities that cannot repay them. These assets would not become accessible following sanctions relief. Nader Habibi, professor of economics of the Middle East at Brandeis University, told us via email his best estimate was that between $30 billion and $50 billion of unfrozen funds were made available to Iran as a result of the deal. On 8 May 2018, President Trump announced that he was pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal with Iran, which had been negotiated over the course of two years.",

        "doc": "In April 2018, Comedian Michelle Wolf became the target of a smear campaign after she offered numerous pointed jabs at members of the Trump administration, news media figures, and politicians at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. Fake news articles were published falsely claiming that Wolf had been fired from her job at Comedy Central and that her stand-up special had been cancelled by Hulu. We also came across an image of purported newspaper clipping from July 2015 reported that Wolf had pled guilty to bestiality charges: Michelle Wolf, a 30 year old aspiring comedian from Hershey, has pleaded guilty to charges of bestiality. Hershey Investigator, Dan Browlinski, told The Sun that several hundred images and videos of Miss Wolf engaging in illegal sexual intercourse with a number of male dogs was found on her hard drive. Browlinski said that the police department was tipped off by an unnamed informant. Wolf graduated from Hershey High School in 2003, and the College of William & Mary in 2007 where she majored in Kinesiology. Wolf was sentenced to 12 months probation and a $1,100 fine. This image is not a reproduction of a real newspaper article, nor was Michelle Wolf arrested in 2015 on bestiality charges. This image was created with a fake newspaper clip generator which allows users to make their own realistic headlines in just a few minutes. The user simply picks a name for a fake newspaper, a title for a fake news article, and writes a brief piece of text, and then the web site generates a passable image of a vintage newspaper clipping.

(Just to clarify, the Snopes Daily did not publish an article entitled \u201cFake News Spreads About Wolf After WH Dinner\u201d on 30 August 1732): The Hershey Sun, the newspaper mentioned in this fake news clipping about Michelle Wolf\u2019s being arrested for bestiality, also published an article debunking the image: \u201cIt\u2019s laughably bad,\u201d The Sun\u2019s Managing Partner David Buffington, said. \u201cThe person who faked this thing messed up all sorts of easily verifiable stuff.\u201d For example, The Sun is a weekly newspaper and is published on Thursdays, not Sundays. The Sun does not use the typefaces shown in the fake clipping, and The Sun\u2019s police news reports are not written in that style. \u201cYou could go to our website, thesunontheweb.com, and figure out that stuff in five minutes,\u201d Buffington said. A search of The Sun\u2019s current archives shows no mention of Dan Browlinski. (The Sun dates back to 1871.) A search of the archives does show that a Michelle Wolf was mentioned in 2010 as a bridesmaid at a wedding. A search of court records in counties covered by The Sun does show that a Michelle Wolf pleaded guilty to speeding in 2018, but the search showed no other offenses.",

        "claim": "More children suffered a severe reaction to the Covd-19 vaccine than required oxygen therapy for Covid-19.",
        "doc": "A video watched more than 700,000 times on YouTube, and being shared on Facebook, wrongly claims that a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) means that \" the risk of adverse events [from vaccination] is roughly a little more than four times greater than the risk of the child requiring oxygenation [from Covid-19]\". The video was posted by a popular YouTuber called Dr John Campbell, who regularly posts videos about Covid, and whose YouTube channel has been watched more than half a billion times. At the end of the video, Dr Campbell invites viewers to \" see if I have misinterpreted anything \". He has, in several ways. The study shows that the vaccines protected children against hospitalisation with Covid, and does not show that the risk of serious adverse reactions to the vaccine was greater than the risk of getting seriously ill with the disease. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What is the study all about? The study used data from Singapore in the early months of 2022, when Omicron was the dominant Covid-19 variant, to assess the effectiveness of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in about a quarter of a million children aged 5 to 11 . Among these children, about 200,000 were fully (two doses) or partially vaccinated during the study period (21 January to 8 April), and about 50,000 were not vaccinated. Up until the end of February (so about half way through the study period), 22 serious adverse events following vaccination were reported within the group, corresponding to 0.005% of doses\u2014although the Singaporean document carrying this data, and which the study links to, says that a reported adverse reaction \" does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment/vaccination \". During the whole study period, there were also a total of 288 hospitalisations with Covid \u2014whether among vaccinated or unvaccinated children\u2014five of which involved the children needing oxygen treatment . The study estimated that fully vaccinated children were about 83% less likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid than unvaccinated children, and partially vaccinated children were also protected, but to a lesser extent. What the video got wrong In his video, Dr Campbell agrees that the study shows that the vaccines significantly protected children against being hospitalised with Covid . He does a different analysis, however. Instead of comparing the number of Covid hospitalisations among vaccinated and unvaccinated children, he compares the number of serious Covid hospitalisations by his own definition (five, who received oxygen treatment) with the number of adverse events reported following vaccination (22), thereby seeming to suggest that the risk of vaccination may outweigh the risk of Covid-19 to children. But this is seriously flawed, in several ways. Firstly, the total number of children seriously ill in hospital with Covid doesn't measure the underlying risk of the disease to them, because about four fifths of the children in the study had already been protected by the vaccine\u2014meaning some of them may otherwise have caught Covid and got seriously ill, but didn't. If Dr Campbell wanted to measure the risks of Covid for people who aren't vaccinated, he should have looked at the rate of hospitalisation among unvaccinated children only. Or, like the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) or the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) looked at the benefits of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations prevented . In any case, Dr Campbell does not count the total number of hospitalisations with Covid (288). He counts only the hospitalisations that needed oxygen treatment (five), with the justification that he believes \"a lot are being admitted on a precautionary basis\". However the study itself does not say that the other 283 admissions were non-serious or \"precautionary\" cases. What about the risks of vaccination itself? Despite excluding 283 of the 288 hospital admissions on the assumption that many may be \"precautionary\" cases, Dr Campbell includes all 22 serious adverse events reported following vaccination when considering the risk from the vaccines. He does this despite not knowing whether these adverse events were as serious as the cases of children needing supplemental oxygen, or whether they were even caused by the vaccine. The events are described by the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in a document cited in the original study. This document explains that an adverse event is classified \"serious\" when \"the event resulted in hospitalisation/extended stay in hospital, resulted in a significant reduction in functioning level/disability, resulted in a life-threatening illness (e.g. anaphylaxis) or death, resulted in birth defects or is a medically important event\". It is therefore possible that some of the 22 events Dr Campbell mentions \"resulted in hospitalisation\", but were in fact less serious than some of the 283 hospital admissions with Covid that he disregards. Dr Campbell also incorrectly suggests that these serious events were caused by the vaccines, including when he describes them as a \"reaction to vaccine\" in the video note. The same HSA document says : \"It is important to note that the [adverse events] reported do not necessarily mean that the vaccine has caused these [adverse events] as they may be related to an underlying or undiagnosed disease or the natural progression of an underlying disease. It may be coincidental that the event occurred around the same time when the vaccine was given but is not caused by the vaccine.\" Dr Campbell does not mention this. How long does protection last? Dr Campbell talks about doing a risk benefit analysis with the data in this study, but a large part of the benefit of the vaccines is not included, because we know that the Covid vaccines continue to protect against hospitalisation with the disease for months at least. According to UKHSA estimates , the Pfizer vaccine still offers around 85% protection, even with Omicron, after 4-6 months. Much of the benefit of being vaccinated therefore wouldn't be captured by this study, which only looked at a period of two and a half months. Any adverse events from vaccination, on the other hand, usually occur within six weeks . The data on adverse events is potentially also incomplete, because the study only included adverse events reported following vaccination up to 28 February, not until the end of the study period. In short, Dr Campbell may sound as though he is comparing the risk of the Covid vaccine to the risk of Covid itself, but his analysis: includes serious adverse events that the vaccine may not have caused excludes many Covid hospitalisations that may have been more serious than those events excludes many Covid hospitalisations that would have occurred if most of the children in the study had not been vaccinated excludes much of the benefit (and potentially some of the risk) of vaccination Full Fact approached Dr Campbell for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. The benefits of vaccination do outweigh the risks The risks to children, both from Covid and from Covid vaccines, are very low. They are also hard to estimate precisely. When assessing the evidence for healthy 5-11-year-olds in February, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the benefits of vaccination were uncertain because they would depend on the size of future waves of Covid and the characteristics of future variants. \"Overall,\" it said, \"the committee agreed that the potential health benefits of vaccination are greater than the potential health risks\".

Similar posts have amassed hundreds of interactions on Instagram.The claim stems from comments Bancel made at a January panel discussing how many vaccine doses Moderna produced in 2019. He never said the stat was a reference to COVID-19 vaccines specifically. Moderna did not begin developing the COVID-19 vaccine until 2020, according to a Moderna spokesperson.The claim is \"totally incorrect,\" according to Kate Cronin, a Moderna spokesperson.The Substack article shows a clip featuring journalist Sasha Vakulina, Bancel and other speakers during a Jan. 18 panel session called \u201cState of the Pandemic\u201d at the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2023 conference in Davos, Switzerland.In the session, Vakulina asks Bancel to discuss vaccine development, adoption and scaling in regard to different variants and subvariants.Bancel says in response:\"So the great news versus 2020, where we are today is that we have manufacturing capacity. ... When the pandemic happened, Moderna had made 100,000 dose in 2019 for the whole year. And I remember walking into the office of my manufacturing and I say, \u2018How about we make a billion dose next year?\u2019 And they look at me a bit funny and say, \u2018What?\u2019 And I say, \u2018Yeah we need to make a billion dose next year, there\u2019s going to be a pandemic.\"He never said the doses were for the COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna made approximately 100,000 vaccine doses in 2019 across all of the company\u2019s products, Cronin said. This does not include the COVID-19 vaccine, which the company had not developed yet.Moderna has worked since 2011 to develop mRNA technology, which uses a genetic code to teach the body\u2019s cells to make a certain protein that trains the immune system, according to the company website.Cronin said Moderna did not have the COVID-19 genetic sequence until Jan. 10, 2020, when it began developing a COVID-19 vaccine using mRNA technology. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.Fact check: Georgia schools' sudden cardiac arrest form is from 2019, predates COVID-19 vaccinesModerna's COVID-19 vaccine gained emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in December 2020, as USA TODAY reported.Bancel has made similar remarks in other interviews. In a November 2021 interview with the American Heart Association, Bancel said Moderna was on track to ship up to 800 million COVID-19 doses, whereas it \"made less than 100,000 doses of any vaccine in all of 2019.\"USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.The Associated Press, Lead Stories, AFP and Reuters also debunked the claim.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

The last date to file one's income tax returns for assessment year 2019 -2020 was previously extended by a month earlier this year - from July 31 to August 31. Therefore, the time at which this fake notice has surfaced is opportune; just one day before the final date of filing returns. Many users online have spread this and fallen for this message. Archived versions of the tweets above can be found here and here. The Income Tax Department, however, has clarified that no such extension has been given through a tweet.

        "claim": "The date of Earth Day was chosen as April 22 by the Unicorn Killer to coincide with Vladimir Lenin's birthday.",
        "doc": "Earth Day is an annual event celebrated since 1970 on April 22, a day on which events are held around the world to demonstrate support for environmental protection. The modern Earth Day observance originated with efforts set in motion by Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson amidst the burgeoning environmental movement of 1969, to create a national day of school teach-ins about environmental issues: On September 9, 1969, Gaylord Nelson spoke a few words to a small crowd in Seattle about his idea for a day of national teach-ins on the environment. Within a few months the Earth Day idea had become a nationwide grassroots event supported by millions of people. How did this happen so quickly? The idea\u2019s momentum began with newspapers. The Associated Press and United Press picked up the story in September 1969 and newspapers across the country reprinted Nelson\u2019s proposal. \u201cNelson Leads Movement,\u201d the headline in the Manitowoc Herald Times proclaimed. Readers learned of a day when \u201ccollege scientists, public leaders, students, and faculty discuss threats to the ecology of the world.\u201d Nelson relayed his wish to see programs scheduled at all the nation\u2019s universities. As wire stories popped up in the next few weeks, the national press took notice. A small notice in Time on October 10 notified millions of Americans about the teach-in. \u201cWisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson is convinced that the hottest growth stick in U.S. protest is conservation,\u201d the article titled \u201cAmerican the Befouled\u201d began. \u201cIn fact, he has been toiling to make the nation\u2019s campuses erupt next spring \u2014 in a giant, peaceful teach-in about environmental evils.\u201d Many read these words and immediately got to work planning their own events. On November 11, 1969, Nelson and his staff announced that April 22, 1970 would be the day of what they named the \u201cNational Teach-In on the Crisis of the Environment.\u201d Another flurry of media attention followed. His November Senate newsletter announced the proposal to his Wisconsin constituents. A New York Times article featured a photograph of University of Minnesota students conducting a ceremonial burial of an internal combustion engine and included the prediction that Nelson\u2019s teach-in \u201ccould be a bigger and more meaningful even than the antiwar demonstrations.\u201d Press coverage swelled throughout the winter and into the spring of 1970. Several newspapers and magazines hired reporters to cover the new environmental beat. Life, Newsweek, Time, Fortune, Esquire and other major periodicals published special environmental editions. Nelson\u2019s teach-in proposal simultaneously gained grassroots support and national publicity from this widespread media attention. Nearly a half-century after that first Earth Day observance, the most common question now associated with this environmental event is \u201cWhy is Earth Day on April 22?\u201d The date has no seeming significance: It falls in the spring, an appropriate season for a celebration dedicated to the preservation and renewal of our planet\u2019s ecology and resources, but it doesn\u2019t fall on the symbolically appropriate first day of spring (also known as the vernal equinox). Peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace at a 1969 UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, a day to be observed on the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere (21 March 1970), but the modern Earth Day takes place a month later. In the lack of any obvious reason for a chosen date of April 22 as Earth Day, various theories have been floated to explain it, ranging from the sensible (it was chosen to coincide with Arbor Day, a traditional day on which the public was encouraged to plant and care for trees), to the ridiculous (that it was selected by \u201cUnicorn Killer\u201d Ira Einhorn to coincide with the birthday of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin): I\u2019m seeing a lot of articles and facebooks posts about Earth Day being founded by Ira Einhorn (the Unicorn Killer), and he made it on Lenin\u2019s birthday. Since the latter example is unfortunately prominent enough to be in need of debunking, we\u2019ll offer one here. Ever since the very first Earth Day, rumors have been floated linking its date of April 22 to the birthday of Vladimir Ilich Lenin, Russian leader of the Bolshevik Revolution and first head of the Soviet state, who was born on that day in 1870. Just after the first Earth Day, Time magazine famously reported claims that the choice of an April 22 date was all part of \u201ca Communist trick\u201d implemented by \u201csubversive elements [who] plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them.\u201d Later commentators have asserted a putative connection between Earth Day and the father of Communism by maintaining that \u201cLenin\u2019s goal was to destroy private property, and this goal is obviously shared by environmentalists.\u201d Into this unsavory brew of notorious Earth Day connections has been stirred the exploits of Ira Einhorn, an environmental activist in the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s who was nicknamed \u201cUnicorn\u201d because his last name means \u201cone horn\u201d or \u201cunicorn\u201d in German. After Einhorn\u2019s then-girlfriend, Helen \u201cHolly\u201d Maddux, broke up with him and moved to New York, she returned to their shared apartment in Philadelphia on 9 September 1977 to collect her personal belongings and was never seen again. Einhorn told police inquring into her disappearance that \u201cshe had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some tofu and sprouts and never returned;\u201d it wasn\u2019t until 18 months later, after one of Einhorn\u2019s neighbors complained about a reddish-brown, foul-smelling liquid leaking from their ceiling (directly below Einhorn\u2019s bedroom closet) that police searched the apartment and found Maddux\u2019s body stuffed in a trunk full of Styrofoam packing, air fresheners and newspapers. Einhorn jumped bail after his arrest and spent the next two decades evading U.S. authorities and hiding out in various European countries before he was finally extradited to the United States from France and put on trial in 2002 (after having been declared guilty via an in-absentia trial in 1993). At his in-person trial, Einhorn (who had been dubbed the \u201cUnicorn Killer\u201d by the press) offered the bizarre defense that his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents, who had in turned framed him for her death because he knew too much about the agency\u2019s paranormal military research. The jury didn\u2019t buy it, and Einhorn was (again) convicted of Maddux\u2019s murder and sentenced to life in prison. Einhorn has since been linked to Earth Day in various news reports identifying him as a \u201cco-founder\u201d of the event and/or \u201cmaster of ceremonies at the first Earth Day;\u201d and accounts of Einhorn\u2019s crime have played up those supposed Earth Day connections and his environmentalist past by (erroneously) stating that he \u201ccomposted\u201d his murdered girlfriend. This confluence of circumstances has led to the rumor that it was the evil, communistic \u201cUnicorn Killer\u201d himself who selected the date for Earth Day, and he chose April 22 because it coincided with Lenin\u2019s birthday. However, Einhorn\u2019s involvement with the original Earth Day was minor and tangential, and his claims of having had more substantial involvement in the event have been disputed by the accounts of others who took part in it, such as testimony of psychiatrist Donald Nathanson offered during Einhorn\u2019s murder trial: Einhorn, during his testimony the day before, had spoken at length about his \u201960s-era protest activities in an effort to make the case that powerful interests may have had an interest in setting him up on a murder rap. One of his claims was that he had been the organizer of the 1970 Earth Day protest, and in fact had been the event\u2019s MC in Philadelphia. But Nathanson, who said he had been on the organizing committee for Earth Day, testified that the committee had barred Einhorn from their discussions, considering him a nuisance. There was no MC, Nathanson said, and Einhorn\u2019s only role at the event had been as a liaison with poet and featured speaker Allen Ginsberg. But, Nathanson said, Einhorn didn\u2019t merely introduce Ginsberg \u2014 he \u201ccommandeered the stage,\u201d speaking \u201cincoherently\u201d for half an hour and refusing repeated requests to leave and let the program continue. It was devastating testimony, and the defense offered no evidence to counter it. The Earth Week Committee of Philadelphia, the group responsible for setting up the first Earth Day, has also denied that Einhorn was significantly involved in the birth of that environmental holiday: We are former members of the original 1970 Earth Week Committee of Philadelphia. Our group, which was made up of 33 members and 92 sponsors, organized the first Earth Day and Earth Week in Philadelphia. We were inspired to undertake this activity because of a speech that was given in 1969 by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day. His idea was implemented not only in Philadelphia, but also in thousands of communities across America in 1970. Much to our dismay, we now find that the self-styled hippie guru and alleged murderer of Holly Maddux, Ira Einhorn, has been taking credit for initiating and/or organizing Earth Day. He is not telling the truth. A group of very dedicated young people worked very hard to organize Earth Day, but Einhorn was not one of them. In fact, Einhorn was asked to leave several meetings of the organizing committee which he attempted to disrupt. He was not welcome there, nor did he contribute in any material way to the committee\u2019s activities. Einhorn, given a small role on the stage at Earth Day, grabbed the microphone and refused to give up the podium for thirty minutes, thinking he would get some free television publicity. We just waited until he had completed his \u201cact\u201d and then got on to the serious business at hand, the keynote speech of U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie, author of the landmark U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970. A good many historical events and birthdays (including those of Isabella I, Emmanuel Kant, and J. Robert Oppenheimer) have taken place on April 22, but neither any of them nor Ira Einhorn has anything to do with the choice of that day for Earth Day. The true (and more mundane) explanation is that when founder Gaylord Nelson was pondering when his first \u201cNational Teach-In on the Crisis of the Environment\u201d should take place, he wanted a date that fell during the Spring but would be far enough into the season that the weather would likely be temperate enough for outdoor celebrations. He also wanted a date late enough in the calendar to avoid any potential conflicts with school exams, spring breaks, or Easter/Passover celebrations that might find students too busy or too far away from school to attend the teach-in. Having determined that the week of April 19\u201325 was optimal for his purposes, Nelson selected the mid-point of that week (Wednesday, April 22) for what would later become celebrated as the first \u201cEarth Day.\u201d",

        "doc": "A Facebook post appealing for help to find a missing five-year-old girl from South Tyneside is a hoax. The post appears in a community buy-and-sell group for South Shields in the North East of the UK. It says: \"Please Help!!! My niece who's 5 years old went out on her bike earlier today in South Shields and still hasn't returned. Her name is Sofia. We recently moved in, so she isn't familiar with the area yet. There is a silver alert activated on her. Please help bump this post so we can get her home safely!! [sic]\" The post shares a photo of a young girl who is supposedly Sofia. However, a reverse image search shows that the photo actually comes from a US article about a child from Washington state who was kidnapped in 2018 by her biological, non-custodial mother. The child, who was found alive and safe in March 2023, is not called Sofia and is eight years old, rather than five. Another clue that the post is a hoax is that it refers to \"silver alerts\". As Full Fact has written before , this is a way of notifying the public about missing people who may be elderly, have dementia or other conditions and which only operates in the US . It is not used in the UK. The post's comment section has been disabled. As Derbyshire Police has previously warned , this is a common sign of a hoax post because it stops people from commenting to alert other Facebook users that the post isn't real. Beyond this, the details in the post are also very similar to another hoax post we have written about recently. Both posts refer to a five-year-old girl called Sofia who has not returned from a bike ride in an unfamiliar area. Other fact checks we've written on hoax posts about injured pets , missing people and abandoned babies also use similar phrasing, such as asking people to \"bump\" the post to help spread the appeal. We have seen hoax posts like these being edited to offer cheap housing, links to surveys or other freebies. This behaviour means that local groups may become overwhelmed with false information and that people genuinely trying to trace relatives or look for missing loved ones could get ignored or even dismissed as false. We have written to Meta expressing these concerns and asking the company to take stronger action in response to this problem. Image courtesy of Solen Feyissa",

        "claim": "On March 4, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden made the comment that Indian Americans are \"taking over the country.\"",
        "doc": "On March 4, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden held a video meeting with the NASA team responsible for landing a massive spacecraft on Mars two weeks earlier as part of the space agency\u2019s ongoing effort to determine whether there is, or was, life on the planet. Sitting at a conference table in the White House\u2019s Roosevelt Room, the president congratulated the team of engineers and scientists on the other side of a screen. They included Swati Mohan, who emigrated from India to the U.S. as a toddler and helped develop and operate the spacecraft\u2019s control system, according to her NASA bio. Soon after the virtual conversation, news outlets across the world published headlines alleging that Biden told Mohan that Indian Americans were \u201ctaking over the country,\u201d without any further context. The claim, at surface value, was true. However, without further details to explain under what circumstances he made the comment and to whom he was referring, the verbatim quote as written in the headlines served as a misleading portrayal of the president\u2019s comments and invited misinterpretation. According to C-SPAN\u2019s video recording of Biden on the call and a White House transcript of the conversation, the meeting included the below-transcribed excerpt: Biden: Hey, Doc. How are you? Mohan: I\u2019m doing very well, Mr. President. Thank you for \u2014 Biden: I just want you to know \u2014 Mohan: \u2014 for taking the time to speak with us. Biden: Are you kidding me? What an honor this is. This is an incredible honor. And it\u2019s amazing. Indian \u2014 of descent \u2014 Americans are taking over the country: you; my Vice President; my speechwriter, Vinay. I tell you what. But thank you. You guys are incredible. In other words, the president indeed said people of Indian descent are \u201ctaking over the country\u201d by, in his opinion, filling more high-profile roles in American politics and science than ever before. He referenced Vice President Kamala Harris and Vinay Reddy, his direct of speechwriting, both of whom have a parent who immigrated to the U.S. from India. The C-SPAN video showed Biden smiling during the moment, discrediting possible assumptions that he highlighted the alleged trend as something negative for America. Additionally, given the tone and timing of the statement, it was erroneous to interpret it literally, or to surmise that the president believed an unknown group of Indian Americans were immediately assuming control of the federal government, for better or worse. Hypothetically speaking, presidential records show, the commander-in-chief would not make that type of significant announcement in a light-hearted tone, in passing, during a video call about an unrelated matter. Also, no evidence showed that Biden believed and proclaimed that a growing number of people were emigrating from India to the United States, or that Indian-Americans were procreating at a rate higher than other populations, so that they were on track to represent the majority of the country\u2019s population. According to the U.S. Census\u2019 American Community Survey, which was last conducted in 2018 as of this report, roughly 4 million people of Indian origin currently live in the U.S., representing about 1% of the total population. In sum, while it was true that Biden literally used the phrase \u201ctaking over the country\u201d while describing what he believes is a growing number of people with Indian ancestry assuming high-profile roles in politics and science, it was false to claim the president meant anything more than to highlight the successes of Indian Americans with the statement. For those reasons, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of misleading and true information.",

        "claim": "\"Republican policies have led to business investment growth that\u2019s 10 times\nfaster than what we saw under President Obama.\"",
        "doc": "Republicans love praising the Trump economy. With one of the lowest unemployment rates in years and steady job growth, there\u2019s a lot to boast about. But just how well does the Trump administration\u2019s overall economic performance compare to his predecessor Barack Obama? And how has the business climate fared under the two presidents? Here\u2019s what U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed in a July 15, 2019 tweet: \"Republican policies have led to business investment growth that\u2019s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama.\" The numbers don\u2019t lie, he says. But how exactly is he measuring them? Although the tweet is a bit old, the issue will be an important one in the coming election, so we decided to take a look. The data To come to his conclusion, Johnson\u2019s staff told us he used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that measures economic growth. Johnson pointed to statistics measuring \"private fixed investment, nonresidential\" which show how much businesses invest in structures, equipment and intellectual property, such as software and research and development. Johnson broadly said growth has been 10 times faster under Trump than Obama in his tweet. Those who read it would, presumably think it took in Obama\u2019s entire eight year tenure. But in the data Johnson used, he only compared the final two years of the Obama administration, 2015 and 2016, to a little over the first two years of data for the Trump administration. That approach often signals cherry-picking. Let\u2019s dig deeper. \"We use the final two years of the Obama administration for comparison because it constitutes a comparable length of time with the two years of data for the Trump administration,\" said Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for Johnson. \"It is a time adjacent to, rather than remote from, the Trump years.\" According to Johnson\u2019s data points, Obama had an average of 0.6% growth in that period, compared to 6.4% under Trump. The Bureau of Economic Analysis updated the data shortly after Johnson made the statement. In doing so, figures for some of the quarters were slightly adjusted, but the overall trend was largely the same. The new numbers showed between 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration had an average business investment growth of 0.7%. Meanwhile, between 2017 and 2018 (and the first quarter of 2019), the Trump administration had a growth of about 5.5%. That\u2019s not far off from the original numbers, though quite not as strong. The full picture Of course, Obama\u2019s term did not start in 2015. Under the full eight years of the Obama administration, the rate of business investment growth was about 3.7%. When bringing Trump\u2019s term to the overall latest numbers, overall growth has been about 4.9%. So, looking at all of Obama\u2019s tenure, the numbers are much more comparable. What about the beginning of Obama\u2019s term. How does it compare to the beginning of Trump\u2019s term? In Obama\u2019s first two years plus an additional quarter -- the period cited by Johnson -- the business investment rate actually declined by 0.3%. This was the period immediately after the Great Recession. That underscores the volatility of the numbers -- and how the timeframe you pick can make a major difference. Other measures, other factors There are other ways to examine business growth -- and another part of the claim to consider: Johnson asserts the growth was caused by GOP policies. Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations. Why? The nation\u2019s GDP -- a conventional measure of the size of the economy -- has also grown over time. \"The share of GDP going to \u2018private fixed investment, nonresidential\u2019 is below the peaks seen in the 1980s and 2000s,\" Sinclair said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it\u2019s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes. Indeed, as we have noted time and again in fact checks, experts say it is wrong to attribute too much to individuals or particular policy changes. There are simply too many factors in the economy to boil it down to one. \"As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,\" Sinclair told us. Our rating Johnson said \"Republican policies have led to business investment growth that\u2019s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama.\" That language may leave the reader thinking the comparison is to Obama\u2019s full term. Johnson, though, said he was only comparing the first two years of Trump to the last two years of Obama. By that measure, there\u2019s an element of truth here. But that element is undermined by the broader picture: When you look at all of Obama\u2019s tenure and other measures, such as share of GDP, the picture is much closer to even between the two. In addition, Johnson over-attributes the cause of recent growth to GOP policies, when there are many other factors at work. Our definition for Mostly False is \"The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That fits here.",

        "claim": "\"Being exposed to the sun for two hours\" kills the 2019 coronavirus.",
        "doc": "According to a recent Facebook hoax, all you need to cure the 2019 coronavirus is a little sunshine. An image published March 9 claims to show a list of recommendations from UNICEF for preventing and treating the virus. Among them include \"drinking hot water and sun exposure\" and \"stay away from ice cream and eating cold.\" \"Corona virus when it falls on the fabric remains 9 hours, so \u2018washing clothes\u2019 or \u2018being exposed to the sun for two hours\u2019 meets the purpose of killing it,\" reads the handout in the photo. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact has fact-checked a variety of false cures and ways to prevent coronavirus infection. We\u2019re adding this one to the list. There is no evidence that sun exposure kills the coronavirus, known officially as COVID-19. UNICEF has debunked the claim. (UNICEF is a humanitarian organization, not a public health institution.) In a statement published March 6, Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, UNICEF\u2019s deputy executive director for partnerships, addressed some misinformation about the coronavirus, including the fake handout. \"A recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease,\" she wrote. \"This is, of course, wholly untrue. To the creators of such falsehoods, we offer a simple message: STOP.\" There is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don\u2019t like heat. Influenza, for example, thrives in dry, cold weather, which is one reason the flu season typically spans from fall to spring. Viruses that cause the common cold also like colder weather. RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself In February, President Donald Trump said the coronavirus will \"go away in April\" due to the arrival of warmer weather. But some health experts have cast doubt on that prediction, saying there\u2019s no guarantee the virus will cease infecting people in the summer. And if it does, that doesn\u2019t mean the virus will be gone for good. As of March 10, more than 113,000 people in 109 countries had been infected with the coronavirus. In the United States, there have been 938confirmed cases and 31deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the best ways to prevent the 2019 coronavirus are to wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face, avoid close contact with sick people, cover your coughs and sneezes, and disinfect surfaces in your home daily. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

        "doc": "A recent web post, flagged by Facebook users, casts President Donald Trump as striking a blow against the \"deep state.\" The term refers to a murky group of people in the Washington bureaucracy and military who secretly pull the levers of power. The website World Politics Now carried the headline \"Trump Orders 13 Obama Deep State Operatives Arrested For Treason,\" Aug. 6. The article reads: \"According to white House sources, a baker\u2019s dozen of Obama operatives will be spending the foreseeable future looking at four gray walls.\" The article cites the work of the conspiracy-minded website Breitbart (the site\u2019s former chief Steve Bannon is now an adviser to Trump). \"Among those arrested were three of Barack Obama\u2019s cabinet members, multiple FBI officials, and numerous others across at least four agencies,\" the article continued. \"White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the news organization (Breitbart) that \"this goes all the way to the top.\" It\u2019s safe to say that arrests of this sort would dominate the news cycle around the world, if they had taken place. They didn\u2019t, of course, and there are no such headlines. There is no article on Breitbart. Sanders, the White House press secretary, didn\u2019t say those words.

        "doc": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a keenly watched politician. Not just his speeches, but his attire and mannerisms on every occasion also make news. And now, a post circulating on social media claims PM Modi changed his dress four times in a day to meet four different leaders. The claim is being shared with a photo collage of Modi with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat. The accompanying caption in Hindi translates to, \u201cWhat kind of poverty is this? He met four people in a day and changed clothes all four times.\u201d The PM has been criticised for his attire ever since he called himself a fakir (hermit) at a rally in Moradabad, UP, back in 2016. However, India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claim to be misleading. The meetings with the four leaders took place on different days. The archived versions of the posts are saved here and here. Using reverse image and keyword search, we found that the meetings took place between June 2 and 11. We have numbered the pictures for identification. Yogi Adityanath met PM Modi on June 11, 2021, in New Delhi. It was a courtesy call and the photograph of this meeting was tweeted by both the UP CM and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on the same day. The PM met Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla on June 10 and a photograph of this meeting was tweeted by his office. After assuming his role as chief minister of Assam last month, Himanta Biswa Sarma met PM Modi in Delhi on June 2. Several news reports carried the picture and Sarma also tweeted his gratitude. Gratitude His towering vision has taken India to glorious heights of prosperity. Assam has especially been a beneficiary of Prime Minister Sri @narendramodi\u2019s generosity.

        "doc": "Deputy president William Ruto has become the latest notable Kenyan politician to speak at London\u2019sChatham House, wherehe highlightedthe country\u2019s progress.The British think tank prides itself on its ability to draw high-profile speakers. It hosted Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta in April 2018 and Kirinyaga county governor Anne Waiguru three months later.Ruto made a number of claims at the event on 8 February 2019. Here we put nine under the microscope.Claim \u201cIn fact, the diaspora is the largest contributor [to] our foreign exchange.\u201d Verdict correctAfrica Check contacted David Mugonyi, Ruto\u2019s spokesperson, for the source the deputy president\u2019s information. He is yet to get back to us.But are diaspora remittances \u2013 which Kenya\u2019s central bankdefinesas \u201cmoney sent by a person in a foreign land to his or her home country\u201d\u2013 the country\u2019s biggest source of foreign currency, asRuto said?Kenya\u2019smajor foreign exchange earnershave over the years included tea, horticulture, apparel and coffee exports, according to the national statistics bureau.But the 2018 economic surveyshowsthat remittances now contribute more. In 2017 they earned Kenya KSh203 billion in foreign exchange.Kenya\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, 2013 to 2017(KSh billion) Year 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Remittances 112.3 126.7 154.1 177.1 202.9 Tea 104.6 94 123 124.5 147.3 Tourism 94 87.1 84.6 99.7 119.9 Horticulture 89.3 97.1 101 110.3 113.3SOURCE:2018 Economic Survey, KNBSClaim \u201c[Remittances contributed] upwards of maybe KSh290 billion last year.\u201d Verdict exaggeratedTheCentral Bank of Kenyacollects data on diaspora remittances. Each month it surveys the flow of money into the country through formal channels such as commercial banks and other authorised remittance service providers.In2018remittances were at US$2.697 billion. Using the central bank\u2019s exchange rate for8 February 2019, when Ruto made the claim, this works out to KSh270.1 billion. Nearly half was from North America.The deputy president said the amount was \u201cupwards\u201d of KSh290 billion, so we rate his claim as exaggerated.Claim \u201cIt is a constitutional requirement\u2026 that when the president is away, the deputy president must be in the country.\u201d Verdict correctRuto apologised to Kenyans living in London that he was unable to meet them, saying he had to rush back to Nairobi as President Uhuru Kenyatta was dueto travel to Ethiopia.In Kenyan law the two leaders could not be out of the country at the same time,he said. \u201cIt is a constitutional requirement which you passed that when the president is away, the deputy president must be in the country.\u201dKenya\u2019s constitutionstates: \u201cWhen the President is absent or is temporarily incapacitated, and during any other period that the President decides, the Deputy President shall act as the President.\u201dDr Luis Franceschi, dean of theStrathmore Law Schoolin Nairobi, confirmed this interpretation of the law. \u201cIt is clear to me that the intention of the drafters was that the president and the deputy president should not be away (from the country) at the same time,\u201dhe told Africa Check.(Note: On 26 February 2014,both leaders were away. State House said Kenyatta was unable to postpone a trip to South Sudan due to the \u201cextraordinary nature\u201d of the conflict there.)Claim \u201cWe have built a standard-gauge railway [of] 600 kilometres... in the last five years.\u201d Verdict mostly-correctTo improve its economy, Kenya is building a rail line that can carry both higher-speed trains and heavier cargo.The first phase of the standard-gauge railway (SGR) from the coastal city of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi has already been built. But several sources have recently put the length at 472 kilometres.These include thepresident\u2019s delivery unit, State House, theChina Road and Bridge Corporation\u2013 the Chinese firm that built it \u2013 and theKenya Institute for Public Policy and Research Analysis, a government think tank.TheKenya Railways Corporationputsthe \u201croute length\u201d at 472 km and the \u201ctrack length\u201d at 609 km - closer to the deputy president\u2019s figure.The main line is 472 km and the total track built 607.4 km, the SGR office told Africa Check. The difference is because there are areas on the main line with multiple tracks. These include two main stations and seven intermediate stations.In total 33 stations account for the difference in rail length, the office said. The second phase of the railway, from Nairobi to the town ofNaivasha, will measure 120.5 km for the main line and 132 km in total track length, it added.Claim \u201c[The railway] has been in the books of our government for 30 years \u2013 it was not built.\u201d Verdict incorrectThe SGR line is expected to strengthen trade in east Africa. According to 2014 parliamentary records, discussions on the railway began in 2003.In 2008 Mwai Kibaki, then Kenya\u2019s president, and his Uganda counterpart Yoweri Musevenisigned a communiqueon the railway.Kenya\u2019s transport ministry says the railway\u2019s journey started in 2007 while a 2009railway masterplan studyfor the East Africa Community says the project was developed in 2007.We have not found any publicly available record that the railway was in the works 30 years ago \u2013 in the 1980s or 1990s.Claim \u201cWe have connected 6.9 million people to electricity in the last five years.\u201d Verdict misleadingSome 6.76 million customers were connected to the electricity grid by 30 June 2018, according to thelatest reportby national utilityKenya Power.In June 2013, a month after the current administration came into office, there were2.33 millioncustomers. This means in those five years some 4.43 million more customers - not 6.9 million - were added to the national grid.(Note: We havepreviously checkedanother claim by the deputy president on the number of connections and rated it as misleading.)Claim \u201cFor 50 years only 2.3 million Kenyans were connected to electricity.\u201d Verdict correctIn 2013, on the 50th anniversary of Kenya\u2019s independence, 2.33 million were connected to the power grid. Africa Check established this when fact-checking the 2017/18budget speechand the2017 State of the Nation Address.Africa Check alsocontinuously tracksthis metric on our promise tracker.Claim \u201cWe have constructed 7,000 kilometres of tarmac in the last five years \u2013 12,000 kilometres were constructed in 50 years.\u201d Verdict unprovenPublicly available data on the length of road built in these five yearsis contradictory.In 2018, Kenyatta said an extra 3,000 km of tarmac was built from 2013 to 2018, butour fact-checkcouldn\u2019t find data to support it.Adetailed analysisof the allocations for roads, and other data such as cement and steel use, does not support the construction of a further 7,000 km of road.Africa Check has for months tried to get reliable data from the transport ministry. Ouraccess to information requesthas been pending at the ministry for the past year, and frequent follow-ups are yet to yield fruit. We thus rate this claim as unproven.Claim \u201cThe number of people on health insurance [has increased] from 3 million to 7 million in a record five years.\u201d Verdict mostly-correctTheNational Hospital Insurance Fundhad 3.79 million principal members in June 2013,according tothe national statistics office\u2019s 2018 economic survey.Membership had grown to 6.8 million by June 2017, and to7.66 millionby June 2018. But to benefit from this insurance, membershave to be up to datewith their monthly payments.(Note: We are checking an additional claim on the number of health workers hired since 2013.)https://africacheck.org/reports/uhuru-kenyattas-2018-state-of-the-nation-address-fact-checked/https://africacheck.org/reports/fact-checking-kenyas-deputy-president-maize-imports-debt-electricity-police/",

BOOM found that the statement was not made by the SP leader but his namesake who also happens to be the national president of Muslim Karsevak Manch.

Fact Check BOOM did a keyword search with terms \"Azam Khan jalsamadhi\" and came across several articles about the Muslim Karsevak Manch national president who goes by the name Kunwar Mohammed Azam Khan. Khan had on July 25 stated that he would commit \"jalsamadhi\" if he is not invited to the Bhumi Pujan Divas on August 5. Articles by News18, and Aaj Tak ran stories on Khan's comment, and carried his image as well. The image shared in the news report clearly shows that this is not the Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan. Both Swarajya and News track Live later edited their story and headline to rectify the mistake but without issuing any clarification in the edited version. BOOM also came across Khan's website and saw several newspaper articles wherein his devotion for Lord Ram is mentioned.",

        "doc": "Speaking to union workers in Philadelphia, Sen. Hillary Clinton began \"a blistering attack on the presumptive Republican nominee\" concerning economic issues, according to theNew York Times. \"His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100-billion additional corporate tax cut,\" Clinton said. Blistering or not, Clinton's attack fairly recites some of McCain's economic proposals. It's worth noting, however that extending existing tax cuts and lowering the corporate income tax rate is not the entirety of McCain's plan for the economy. Among other things, McCain also proposes eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to make sure wealthy people paid a share of taxes but has become a problem in recent years for upper middle class families, too. Still, McCain's support for extending President Bush's tax cuts is well known. We checked it out notone,two,three,four, butfivetimes because former candidate Mitt Romney and various political groups have harped on the fact that McCain originally opposed the Bush tax cuts before supporting them. McCain's camp could argue with the word \"billionaires\" because the Congressional Budget Office found the Bush tax cuts most benefited the top 1 percent of earners who had an average salary of $1.25-million. It goes without saying that billionaires are in the top 1 percent, too, but clearly most people in that tax bracket wouldn't fit that definition. But it's also clear they aren't hurting, financially, either. Clinton doesn't embellish at all when it comes to describing McCain's additional $100-billion corporate tax cut. She clearly is referring to his proposal to slice the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, as McCain has outlined on his campaign Web site. McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told theWall Street Journalit would cost $100-billion a year. McCain's campaign estimates the entirety of its tax cuts would total $400-billion a year. Clinton didn't mention that part, which causes us concern. Her statement suggests that McCain has only two ideas for helping the economy, and that's not true. Yes, she accurately describes those two elements of McCain's economic proposal, but she's wrong to suggest that's all McCain has in mind. For that, we give her a Half True. ",

        "doc": "Gov. Rick Scott's Independence Day e-mail message to state employees offered thanks to servicemen and women for defending our freedom, a reminder to use care with fireworks over the drought-parched weekend \u2014 then support for pension reform. \"I also want to share with you information I came across in a New York Times articlelast week. A recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year. \"That means if we did nothing, every household in Florida would have to contribute more than $800 of their hard-earned money every year, for the next thirty years, just to meet our pension obligations for state and local government retirees. \"As I\u2019ve said all along, raising taxes is not an option. The pension reform we accomplished this year prevents tax hikes, and also protects the retirement of government workers.\" A state employee asked us: Did a recent study in the New York Times actually say taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year nationally \u2014 $813 a year for Floridians \u2014 to support public employee pensions? We should mention the pension reform Scott recently signedwas a law requiring state workers to put 3 percent of their salaries toward retirementand eliminating cost-of-living increases on benefits earned after July 1. We checked out theNew York Timesarticle, which focused primarily on pension challenges in Costa Mesa, Calif. A related graphic told the national story. Headlined \"Tax Increases for Government Pensions,\" it said that \"even if pensions are funded today, costs are expected to rise as promises come due. Though many pension funds dispute their findings, two economists, Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua D. Rauh, have calculated: How much each state needs to increase taxes per household per year to eventually fund its pensions 100 percent ... or the returns that state pension funds need to earn every year for the next 30 years to be fully funded.\" A list of states followed. In Florida that annual tax increase was estimated at $813 \u2014 just what Scott wrote. Meanwhile, the abstract ofthe complete study\u2014 also linked to from the story \u2014 said it would take a tax increase of $1,398 per U.S. household per year to fully fund state and local pension systems over the next 30 years. So Scott's message actually used a slightly more conservative number. He could have rounded up to $1,400. So Scott accurately quoted both the state and national estimates for tax increases it would take to fully fund pensions, according to Novy-Marx and Rauh. But he also said taxes \"would have to be increased.\" Even a quick look at the New York Times graphic shows that's not the case. The economists had in fact offered an either/or scenario. Either Florida would need to increase taxes each year by $813, or it would need to average a 12.1 percent return on its pension fund investments. We asked Joshua Rauh to clarify this for us. Hang with us for just a few moments of economist-speak. He said the baseline scenario for the tax increase calculation was an asset return of inflation plus today's long-run real Treasury bond yields \u2014 under today's conditions, an annual return of just under 5 percent. \"If returns are more than that, required tax increases for Florida will be less than $813,\" he said. \"If returns are less than that, required tax increases will be more than $813. To eliminate the need for tax increases entirely, returns would need to be 12.1 percent a year.\" A footnote to the New York Times graphic pointed out that historical returns nationally averaged about 8.8 percent a year.In other words, if over 30 years Florida pulled in the average historical return on its investments, it would still need to raise taxes. But it wouldn't need to raise taxes by a full $813 a year. Meanwhile, \"Tax Increases for Government Pensions\" wasn't the only graphic that accompanied the New York Times article. The story also included a handy map headlined \"A $176 Billion Gap for Public Pensions.\" Sounds like it would support Scott's description of \"currently unsustainable public employee pension systems,\" doesn't it? Under the headline, the graphic reads, \"In general, many experts say pension funds should hold 80 percent of the funds needed for future obligations. Many states, however, have failed to put enough aside.\" The map showed which states fall short of the 80 percent goal, and by how much \u2014 and which states exceed the 80 percent goal, and by how much. Given Scott's message to state employees, which category would you assume Florida is in? Well, it turns out that by this measure, Florida's fund is among the nation's most healthy. Its pension funds hold $5.9 billion over the traditional 80 percent benchmark, the graphic shows. And that's the story supported bya Pew Center studylast year and the most recentannual state reporton Florida's pension funds. While other states' funds entered the recession underfunded, Florida's was fully funded. And while it took a hit during the recent economic tsunami,in 2010 it gained more than 14 percent, ahead of the state's target. That added $9.8 billion to the bottom line. Ash Williams, executive director and chief investment officer for the State Board of Administration of Florida, which oversees the state's pension investments, declared in November, \"We are healthy.\" He called Florida's plan \"a very positive exception to the rule\" that \"remains one of the best-funded, and therefore strongest, public plans in the country. Still, there have been plenty of voices saying Florida would need to raise taxes, increase returns or trim benefits to keep that plan strong. AndScott has made it clearhe doesn't share Williams' sunny take. For example, he thinks the state's expected return of 7.75 percent requires too risky an asset mix for contributions that should be cautiously invested. So there's legitimate disagreement about the long-term health of even comparatively healthy public pension systems like Florida's. But we can still weigh in on the accuracy of Scott's characterization of the New York Times report to state employees. Scott told them that \"a recent study revealed that, across the nation, taxes would have to be increased by an average of $1,300 a year just to support the currently unsustainable public employee pension systems. In Florida, that dollar figure translates to $813 a year.\" But he left out that investment returns could also offset this need. He also failed to distinguish between states that have long struggled to meet their pension goals, and Florida's comparatively strong performance. We think those are important details, and rate Scott's statement Half True.",

It has done so since its inception in 1913,\" the letter reads. \"Since that time, the U.S. Dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power. We believe that this alone is compelling reason enough to tear down the veil and audit the Fed. Chairman Bernanke's recent actions make the need for this audit all the more urgent.\"Upon hearing the 98 percent number we wondered two things:1) Really?2) And if so, is it all the Fed\u2019s fault? Asked how they arrived at their conclusion, the letter\u2019s co-authors said they used gold.\"In 1913 the official price of an ounce of gold was $20.64. Today, an ounce of gold buys $1,370. That is an increase in the price of gold of some 6,530%; seen another way, the value of the dollar versus gold has fallen 98.5 percent,\" explained Jamie Jacoby with the Richmond Tea Party.Those numbers do check out. But they are meaningless, according to C. Barry Pfitzner, a professor of economics at Randolph-Macon College.Pfitzner noted that the U.S. is no longer on the gold standard, which ended in 1914. Even the gold \"exchange\" standard -- under which official holders of dollars like foreign banks and treasuries could convert dollar holdings to gold -- ended in 1971.\"The current market gold price is nothing more than the equivalent of any other speculative commodity. Not unlike, say, silver, diamonds, platinum -- or for that matter, hog futures,\" Pfitzner said. \"So one could argue that the dollar has lost 98 percent of its power to purchase gold. So what? Irrelevant. And the Fed is not to blame. It does not control the price of gold.\"Dean Croushore, chair of the economic department in University of Richmond\u2019s Robins School of Business, agreed. \"Economists generally think of purchasing power as the amount of goods that a person can buy with a dollar, not the amount of gold that a person can buy with a dollar,\" he said. \"Measuring the amount of goods that one can buy with a dollar is best done using a price index, such as the consumer price index.\"Well, that\u2019s easy enough.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, a dollar in 1913 had the same buying power as $22.09 today, about a 95 percent decline.Rather than the gold standard, the BLS calculator uses the average Consumer Price Index for a given calendar year. That data represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households.Now, on to the next point. Is the Fed really responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years?\"That is not a great record and the blame does belong with the Federal Reserve, especially in the high inflation years from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s,\" Croushore said. He added that the Fed\u2019s record \"improved in the past 20 years, when the average annual inflation rate has been 2.5 percent.\"Pfitzner noted two problems with putting all the blame on the Fed: the change in what money is used for and the difference in incomes.\"No economist would argue that the index from 1913 is comparable to the index in 2010,\" Pfitzner said. \"The mix of goods that consumers purchase is entirely different.\"As to his second point, the annual income per person today is about $33,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913. So while the dollar is worth far less today, we have far more of them to spend.\"If we blame the Fed for inflation (and the taming of inflation in recent decades), seems they should also get some credit for growth in real incomes,\" Pfitzner said.Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called \"pretty constant\" relative to other currencies.\"The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank,\" Bosworth said.So let\u2019s look back over the facts.No doubt, the value of a dollar has plummeted since 1913, when milk cost eight cents a quart. The Tea Party\u2019s says the buck has dropped by 98 percent, but its use of the gold standard to measure the greenback is not a relevant gauge. Using the Consumer Price index, as many economists recommend, we find the dollar fell by 95 percent since 1913.So the Tea Party, despite its disputed methods, wound up with a figure that\u2019s in the ballpark.But in bemoaning the drop in value of a dollar, the Tea Party omits a huge mitigating factor: salaries have grown enormously since 1913 and consumers have more to spend. If the Fed\u2019s historic handling of inflation is to be blamed for the drop in the dollar, it must be credited for the rise in wages.We rate the claim Half True.",

Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Claim: The UP government is procuring stubble from farmers, nearly 5000 quintals of stubble is procured, and farmers are given cow dung in return. Fact: The Unnao district administration, in order to check stubble burning has launched a unique initiative of barter scheme under which farmers can trade two trolleys of stubble for one trolley of bio-fertilizer (cow dung manure). However, we could not find any credible information regarding the UP government\u2019s procurement of 5000 quintals of stubble from farmers and also about the initiative being implemented across all districts in UP. Hence the claim made in the post is TRUE. Google search with relevant keywords led us to a few news articles which reported the UP government\u2019s stubble buying initiative. According to these articles, Unnao district administration has launched a unique initiative under which farmers will be provided one trolley of bio-fertilizer (cow dung manure) in lieu of two trolleys of stubble in order to curb the practice of stubble burning. Another news article which states the same can be read here. However we could not find any credible information regarding the UP government\u2019s procurement of 5000 quintals of stubble from farmers and also about the initiative being implemented across all districts in UP. To sum it up, it is true that a barter scheme of trading stubble for bio-fertilizer is launched in Unnao district, UP.",

It is not the first time that VERA Files Fact Check debunked this claim. (Read related story Claim that Sara Duterte will abolish K to 12 FALSE) The video content shows a vlogger reacting to a clip published by YouTube channel BANAT NEWS TV, which is notorious for publishing political disinformation. Contrary to the claim of the circulating video that the basic education program has been \u201cscrapped,\u201d the narrator said the program had been \u201crevised\u201d and that military service would replace the last two years of senior high. This is also not true. The Department of Education (DepEd) has yet to formulate a revised program. The reaction video came out four days after palace press briefer Daphne Ose\u00f1a Paez said DepEd \u201cwill be presenting a revised K to 12 curriculum for basic ed on Jan. 30.\u201d An official from the Office of the Press Secretary later clarified that DepEd would be presenting the Basic Education Report 2023 to Marcos, not the revised K to 12 program. The report will only \u201cinclude updates on the ongoing review\u201d of the curriculum expected to be finished by June 2023. Duterte-Carpio previously said that abolishing the system \u201cneeds to be discussed\u201d and \u201ccannot be decided overnight.\u201d In July 2022, the vice president said Marcos gave DepEd one year to \u201cgive a final answer\u201d about the program.

        "claim": "\"For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes (on gambling), somebody loses $6.\"",
        "doc": "While the Senate signaled its gambling bills were all but dead this year, they\u2019ve stayed on life support in the House. But one lawmaker wanted his fellow representatives to remember gaming revenues come at a high price. Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, said lawmakers should remember that all gaming revenue is money someone has lost. \"Every time you lose a dollar at gaming, there's six more dollars that are lost,\" Van Zant said during a Feb. 29, 2016, meeting of the House Finance and Tax Committee. \"For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6, is another way of saying that.\" Van Zant was speaking against HB 7109, a wide-ranging gaming bill that in part allowed for the ratification of the contentious gaming compact the Seminole Tribe of Florida negotiated with Gov. Rick Scott in 2015. The bill also included all sorts of provisions for pari-mutuels, licenses and permits, care of racing greyhounds, and more. While the measure passed and was reported favorably to the House, the Senate postponed its own gambling bills March 1. Barring some extraordinary procedural move, the Senate measure is likely tabled for the rest of the session, which ends March 11. That means the new compact likely won\u2019t be ratified. Van Zant opposes gambling in general, so his point of view is that any gambling revenue, whether for the state or a casino or track, is all money taken from people who have placed a bet of some form. We\u2019re not going to focus on his moral objections, but we were curious whether people lose six times what the state gets in taxes from gaming. It turns out that it depends on what kind of gambling you\u2019re talking about. Gambling revenues Van Zant was not specific in the hearing about what form of gambling he meant, but his office referred us to a 2005 report in the National Tax Journal about state and local government taxes on casinos nationwide. \"The American Gaming Association (2004) reports that 443 commercial casinos in 11 states generated more than $27 billion in gross gaming revenue in 2003,\" the report read. \"State and local governments derived $4.32 billion in direct gaming taxes from this economic activity, or about 16 percent of gross gaming revenue.\" That 16 percent rounds to $1 of state revenue for every $6 gamblers spend, Van Zant\u2019s office said. Those numbers are more than a decade old, so we looked up a more current snapshot. The American Gaming Association in 2014 said casino gaming revenues (from gambling, not hotel rooms or drinks or some such) were $67 billion, and casinos paid out $10 billion in state and local taxes. So more recently, the nationwide figure rounds up to almost 7 to 1. But applying that logic to Florida\u2019s gambling environment is difficult, at best. It would have helped if Van Zant had been more specific, because Florida has several forms of gambling. There are cardrooms, where people play poker and other games; pari-mutuels, which areessentially horse and dog racing; slot machines; lotteries; and Indian-owned casinos. The state gets a cut of all these forms of gambling, but the percentage varies depending on the game. For example, cardrooms are taxed at 10 percent. The slot machine tax rate, meanwhile, is 35 percent. There are various fees and permits and other charges involved, too. \"I think the national statistic stands on its own merit, but it is problematic to apply it to Florida\u2019s specific tax and revenue-sharing structure related to legal gambling,\" state economist Amy Baker from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research told us. \"The gaming taxes are all on different bases and aren\u2019t designed to be functionally equivalent.\" She added the state hadn\u2019t done a comprehensive revenue analysis across all forms of gambling combined, but it wouldn\u2019t be a fast or simple calculation. To even try to make a direct comparison to Van Zant\u2019s stat, we could lookat only casino revenue. Seven of Florida\u2019s eight casinos \u2014 which share revenue with the state \u2014 are owned by the Seminole Tribe. The state\u2019s cut of casino revenue is spelled out in the Tribe\u2019s compact, a business agreement that sovereign Indian tribes must enter into with their home states in order to run casinos on their land. (This is the agreement the Tribe wants the Legislature to renew with some new provisions.) The state is technically not allowed to tax the Tribe, because that\u2019s against federal law. But the compact allows the state to agree with the Tribe to get money via \"revenue sharing.\" Under terms of the compact that expired last year, the Seminoles agreed to share gaming revenues with the state based on tiers: The Tribe would pay 12 percent of net revenue up to $2 billion, 15 percent of revenue between $2 billion and $3 billion, and so on. Some of that revenue was guaranteed, while the rest depends on how well the casinos did in a given year. Calculating net revenue can get pretty complicated, but the shorthand version is that the state said the effective cut those casinos gave the state was 12.24 percent in 2015. That ratio comes out to about 8 to 1 \u2014 in effect, people gamble away $8 for every $1 the state gets, using Van Zant\u2019s reasoning. That\u2019s more than the 6 to 1 ratio he cited, but again, that\u2019s just casino dollars. As we\u2019ve noted, other forms of gambling bring in more taxes per dollar, some less. We also should point out that the vast majority of this money is what economists refer to as \"cannibalized.\" That is, it\u2019s money coming from people already in the state who gamble instead of spending that money elsewhere. Our ruling Van Zant said, \"For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6.\" His argument is that the taxes states receive from gaming revenue is money other people have lost while gambling. Van Zant was using nationwide figures from 2005 for the amount of tax money state and local governments received from casinos. That ratio changed to about 7 to 1 by 2014. But that comparison is tough to apply to Florida. The state has more forms of gambling than just casinos, and the state gets money from all of them in different ways and at different rates. If we look at just the terms of how the Seminole Tribe shares its casino revenue, the state gets about $1 for every $8 people spend in casinos. Van Zant\u2019s larger point stands that state tax revenue comes at the expense of comparatively high gambling losses, but the details are fuzzy at best. We rate his statement Half True.",

        "claim": "\"Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is signed into law, we will have delivered $2 billion\" in tax relief.",
        "doc": "Gov. Scott Walker likes to say he \"loves\" taxpayers. In early March 2014, he counted the ways and declared he\u2019s given Wisconsin taxpayers 2 billion reasons to love him back. \"The hardworking taxpayers of Wisconsin know how to spend their money better than politicians in Madison do, so I thank members of the Senate for helping us return the state\u2019s surplus to the people who earned it,\" Walker said in a statement for reporters after his latest tax-cut plan won approval in the Senate. He added this: \"Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is signed into law, we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin and more than $135 million for worker training programs.\" That $2 billion number is likely to be repeated quite a bit during Walker\u2019s re-election bid this year. So we decided to check it out. Is Walker right? It\u2019s clear from the statement that Walker is talking -- at the very least -- about the effect of tax changes enacted during his time in office, including in the four years covered by two budgets he\u2019s signed. The second budget runs through June 2015, six months after Walker\u2019s term expires. The four-year time frame means Walker is lumping into his claim the future effect of some of the tax cuts. But he made it obvious that he was talking about a tally of tax relief that will come come as a result of the actions of this term. The tax-relief number There\u2019s more than one way to get to a bottom line, but we found that Walker\u2019s claim is within $100 million -- high or low -- depending on various factors. Walker\u2019s office sent us a tally of more than 65 tax changes -- mostly cuts, and a few increases -- enacted by legislators and Walker from 2011 to present, including measures from the two budgets. The state budget office calculated the tax relief total at $1.98 billion. Due to some methodology differences, the state Department of Revenue put the total at slightly over $2 billion, according to the spreadsheet provided by Walker\u2019s office. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau\u2019s director, Bob Lang, and the agency\u2019s tax policy supervisor, Rob Reinhardt, reviewed the list at our request. They put the total at closer to $1.9 billion. \"It\u2019s right around $2 billion,\" Lang told us. So the figure holds up. The tax relief total, we should note, is not a hard number. It can\u2019t be, because it includes estimates of how much tax relief will flow over the course of four-plus years from various measures. And it includes various projections. But that is a routine practice in Madison math and a reasonable way to make a tax-relief claim. Where it came from Most of that total came from moves that drew big headlines, including two separate cuts in income tax rates, multiple property tax relief measures, and phasing out the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Others measured were more narrowly tailored or were overshadowed by other events. They included business tax credits for job creation, various tax cuts for business and a host of technical or small-bore changes including several new sales tax exemptions. Remember the sales tax exemption approved for manufactured homes? Or the one on the sale of oil and fat converted to motor fuel? Or the exemption for printers? We didn\u2019t think so. The income tax cuts alone account for about $750 million in estimated relief, and property tax relief another $500 million. The Walker figures do not include changes in withholding rates that will make sure tax cuts show up in paychecks rather than requiring people to seek refunds to see the benefit. How relieving is all this tax relief? State and local taxes totaled $27.4 billion in 2013. A year\u2019s worth of the four-year relief Walker is talking is about $500 million. So, the relief amounts to about 2 percent of total taxes, says Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Individual results would vary, of course. Finally, Walker administration officials argued that Walker would have been justified in using $2.5 billion as his tax-relief figure. He kept in place and funded several phased-in tax-cut measures put in place during his predecessor Jim Doyle\u2019s last term, spokesman Tom Evenson noted. We\u2019ll confine our ruling here, though, to the $2 billion claim. Our rating Walker declared that once his latest tax-cut plan is signed, \"we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin.\" Some of this is best guesswork, but estimates from multiple sources -- including the nonpartisan office used by the Legislature -- confirm the figure is right around that number. We rate Walker\u2019s statement True. Note: This item was changed after publication. It originally said the Fiscal Bureau's estimate included the effect of changes to the Earned Income and Homestead tax credits.",

        "claim": "Brian Kemp \"dismissed concerns about voter fraud in the 2020 election\" and \"widespread illegal ballot harvesting continued, electing two Democrat senators.\"",
        "doc": "Republican voters in Georgia are being told that GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who is seeking re-election, is not up to defeating the expected Democratic nominee, Stacey Abrams. The warning comes in a TV ad from Get Georgia Right, a conservative super PAC that says its aim is to elect Republicans in Georgia and for president. Kemp \"dismissed concerns about voter fraud in the 2020 election\" and \"widespread illegal ballot harvesting continued, electing two Democrat senators,\" the narrator claims in the 30-second spot, which shows people appearing to place ballots inside drop boxes. \"If Kemp can\u2019t beat voter fraud, he won\u2019t beat Stacey Adams,\" the ad said. The ad does not mention Kemp\u2019s competitor for the Republican nomination in the May 24 primary, former U.S. Sen. David Perdue. But Politico reported April 13 that Get Georgia Right is dedicated to defeating Kemp and that it received $500,000 from former President Donald Trump\u2019s Save America PAC. That accounts for nearly all the funds that Get Georgia Right had on hand as of March 31, according to its latest report to the Federal Election Commission. There is no evidence to back the ad\u2019s illegal voting claims. The roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election were counted three times, including once by hand. Georgia state and local officials found no evidence of systematic voter fraud. The secretary of state\u2019s office investigated claims about dead or otherwise ineligible voters and debunked allegations of fraud, such as the false claim that election workers in Atlanta were caught on tape secretly counting \"suitcases\" of fake ballots. We rated a Perdue claim that the 2020 presidential election and subsequent Georgia Senate runoff elections \"were stolen\" Pants on Fire. The winners of the runoffs, which were held because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the November 2020 elections, are the two Democratic senators the ad alludes to: Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. In the runoffs, Ossoff defeated Perdue and Warnock defeated Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, certified those results, affirming that the returns \"are a true and correct tabulation of the certified returns received by this office from each county.\" Kemp signed off on the certification. Kemp in November 2020 rejected calls from state Republican leaders for a special legislative session to tighten voter residency requirements for the runoffs, saying: \"Any changes to Georgia\u2019s election laws made in a special session will not have any impact on an ongoing election and would only result in endless litigation.\" In March 2021, Kemp signed legislation that adds new identification requirements to absentee voting and limits ballot drop boxes. Kemp\u2019s office said in November 2021 it identified dozens of \"inconsistencies\" in the 2020 election. But those instances did not warrant an investigation by the state election board, Kemp said. \"Ballot harvesting\"generally refers to someone collecting absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them to official election drop boxes. In Georgia, it is generally illegal to collect and submit multiple mail ballots. Exceptions are made for physically disabled voters. Raffensperger in January said that his office was investigating claims of ballot harvesting, but \"no one has alleged that those are fraudulent ballots. Those were lawful voters.\" So far, claims that widespread fraudulent votes were cast via illegal ballot harvesting remain unproven. Get Georgia Right told PolitiFact it obtained videos from various Georgia counties that it said show \"tens of thousands of ballots that were cast beyond the single ballot allowed per person using a drop box\" in the November 2020 and January 2021 runoff elections, exceeding the margins of victory in the presidential race and both runoffs. The group did not share those videos with PolitiFact and it did not say whether it had submitted those videos to authorities for an investigation. Moreover, even if people violated the law by submitting ballots for multiple people, that alone would not make the ballots invalid. The law does not say that illegal ballot harvesting, in and of itself, invalidates the ballots or makes them illegal. True the Vote, a conservative Texas group that says it works to protect the integrity of elections, in January 2022 also alleged ballot harvesting in the November 2020 and January 2021 elections. Last year, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to proceed on the allegation. True the Vote has since said it has a witness, but has yet to reveal the person\u2019s identity. The State Election Board voted March 16 to issue subpoenas to the group to obtain the name of the witness. If neither Perdue nor Kemp gets more than 50% of the primary vote, there will be a runoff on June 21. In the Nov. 8 general election, the Republican nominee is expected to face Abrams, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary. Kemp won his first term as governor in 2018 by defeating Abrams, a former George state lawmaker, by about 50% to 49%. Campaign watchers rate the general election as a toss up and \"tilts Republican.\" Get Georgia Right, a conservative super PAC, said Kemp \"dismissed concerns about voter fraud in the 2020 election\" and \"widespread illegal ballot harvesting continued, electing two Democrat senators.\" Kemp dismissed claims of voter fraud after investigations showed there was no evidence that such fraud happened in the 2020 election or in the January 2021 runoffs. Two Georgia Democrats were elected to the U.S. Senate in the runoffs and their election results were certified by state officials in Georgia who were Republicans. The claim that illegal ballot harvesting happened in Georgia is not proven. We rate the claim False.

        "doc": "After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, various states imposed regulations on abortions. In Alabama, those who administer abortions \u2013 except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger \u2013 can face jail time, according to the state\u2019s law.But some social media users are claiming a young girl who gets an abortion in the state would be charged with a severe penalty herself.\"In Iran if a 12-year-old girl is raped and impregnated by her father, she must carry the baby to term, or be thrown in prison for life. Wait, sorry, no. That's Alabama,\" reads an Instagram post shared Sept. 25.The post generated over 150 likes in less than two weeks. Similar posts have spread widely on Facebook.But the scenario in the post is not possible, criminal law experts said.None of the statutes in Alabama criminalizing abortion impose life imprisonment on women who have received or attempted to receive an abortion. And most cases involving minors in the state are handled in juvenile court.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksUSA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.There is no truth to the claim, John Acevedo, a criminal law expert at the University of Alabama, told USA TODAY.First, none of the statutes criminalizing abortion in the state include the potential of life in prison for a woman getting an abortion.The state\u2019s felony statute governing abortion now that Roe has been overturned, House Bill 314, explicitly states that \u201cno woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminal or civilly liable.\u201d\"The age of the woman, her reason for receiving an abortion and the manner they were impregnated are irrelevant under the current statute \u2013 no woman has (felony) criminal liability,\u201d Acevedo said.The state's misdemeanor statute doesn\u2019t have language specifically exempting a pregnant woman from prosecution, according to Amy Kimpel, director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at the University of Alabama. Case law pre-dating Roe v. Wade did interpret the misdemeanor statute as allowing for the prosecution of a woman who aided and abetted in her own abortion, Kimpel said.But because that interpretation of the misdemeanor law hasn't been tested yet in a prosecution since Roe was overturned, it is not guaranteed that the interpretation will be upheld in court, Acevedo said.\u201cIt is certainly (something) a woman should be concerned about seeking an abortion in Alabama,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cBut it is not a foregone conclusion that she would be prosecuted and that the courts would find that she was eligible for prosecution.\u201dFact check: In Alabama, sentencing varies for illegal abortion, rapeIn any case, the maximum penalty under the misdemeanor statute is one year in jail, Acevedo said.And the post cites a scenario where a 12-year-old is the mother, which makes the claim even more off base.The prosecution of a 12-year-old girl would be handled in the juvenile delinquency system rather than in adult criminal court, Kimpel said. Juvenile delinquents are not held in prison but in youth detention facilities.There is no life imprisonment sentence in juvenile detention. The maximum penalty for any child under the juvenile system is detention until the age of 21, according to Acevedo.A prosecutor can ask that a case be transferred from juvenile court to adult criminal court, but Kimpel said it's unlikely a judge would grant that request for a 12-year-old who seeks to abort a pregnancy caused by incest.Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that a 12-year-old girl who gets an abortion in Alabama is thrown in prison for life. None of the statutes in Alabama criminalizing abortion impose life imprisonment on a woman who has received or attempted to receive an abortion. The case of a 12-year-old girl would also be handled in juvenile court, so there is no possibility of prison time.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

        "claim": "The Bush tax cuts \"created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession.\"",
        "doc": "During an interview on NBC\u2019s Today show, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, offered some job-creation statistics to cast a favorable light on the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.Host Matt Lauer said to Boehner, \"You talk about creating jobs. When the Bush era tax cuts were passed in 2001, unemployment in this country was 4.5 percent. Today it's at 9 percent, just down from 10 percent. So why are the Bush era tax cuts creating jobs?\"Boehner responded that the tax cuts \"created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession.\"Several readers suggested that we check Boehner\u2019s statistics. So we did. Boehner's statement actually has several problems. One is the question of whether the tax cuts actually caused the job growth; more on that later. First, we\u2019ll point out something more basic -- that Boehner\u2019s chronology is off. The first of the tax cuts was passed in June 2001, so we haven\u2019t hit a full 10 years since the first cut was enacted, and we\u2019re only about eight years past the enactment of the second round of cuts. We\u2019ll give Boehner the most generous parameters possible -- from the signing of the first tax cut in June 2001 until the pre-recession employment peak, which came in January 2008. (When we contacted Boehner\u2019s office, they confirmed that this is the comparison he had in mind.)We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. Here are the numbers:June 2001: 132,047,000 people employedJanuary 2008: 137,996,000 people employedIncrease during that six-and-a-half-year period: 5,949,000 people That\u2019s roughly 6 million jobs -- significantly below the 8 million Boehner cited.Now let\u2019s turn to the jobs lost during the recession. We once again calculated the numbers in the way most favorable to Boehner -- from the peak of employment (January 2008) to the lowest point (February 2010). Here are the figures:January 2008: 137,996,000 people employedFebruary 2010: 129,246,000 people employedDecrease during the roughly two-year period: 8,750,000 people That\u2019s almost 9 million jobs lost -- almost twice what Boehner had said on Today.What\u2019s going on?When we reached Boehner\u2019s office, spokesman Michael Steel provided a different set of numbers -- numbers that we determined were from a different set of BLS statistics, known as the Current Population Survey.The numbers from the CPS data are produced by a smaller survey of individuals and families. They are best known for producing the widely tracked national unemployment rate, but the data also include an estimate of the raw number of employed Americans, which is what Boehner used.Here are the CPS figures for the same periods we looked at above:June 2001: 136,873,000 people employedJanuary 2008: 146,407,000 people employedIncrease over about six and a half years: 9,534,000 people January 2008: 146,407,000 people employedFebruary 2010: 138,698,000 people employedDecrease over about two years: 7,709,000 people So using the CPS figures, Boehner actually underestimated the jobs created after the passage of the Bush tax cuts, rather than overestimating them. And his number of jobs lost in the recession was closer to the CPS number than to the CES number.In other words, using one set of data, Boehner\u2019s way off, and using another set, he\u2019s closer. What gives?For the periods studied, the two data sets\u2019 varying methodologies appear to have produced large differences in the number of jobs created and lost. While both statistics have their advantages and disadvantages, the CES numbers are \"usually preferred when talking about job growth or loss,\" said Stacey Standish, a BLS spokeswoman.And there\u2019s this problem: What if we had used Boehner's 10 year figure rather than the six-and-a-half-year upswing of jobs? Over the full 10 years, employment has actually fallen by more than 1 million jobs using CES numbers and risen by 2.8 million according to the CPS figures. Either way, both figures are well below the job gains Boehner touted for the full 10-year period. Meanwhile, there are other concerns beyond the statistics. While J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he feels both CES and CPS are valid measures, he wondered whether Boehner had oversold cause and effect. \"The real issue is the statement that the Bush tax cuts \u2018created\u2019 these jobs,\" Foster said. \"Would the economy have created no jobs during this period but for the tax cuts?\" And Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, argues that \"the more basic point is that under either measure of employment gain, the proportional rise in employment in the Bush Administration after passage of his initial tax cut was comparatively small.\"Burtless put together a comparison of recent two-term presidential administrations\u2019 job growth over the equivalent period -- the 81 months starting in the June after the president\u2019s inauguration. George W. Bush produced smaller job gains than most recent administrations regardless of which employment measure is used.Employment under Bush grew by 4.5 percent using CES and 7 percent using CPS, whereas employment grew by double digits under presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, and also under the combined eight-year administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, who finished Nixon's term after he resigned, and John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Only under Eisenhower was job growth more sluggish than it was under George W. Bush, and even then, it was only the case using one of the two BLS statistics. (Burtless did not compare job growth during the administrations of George H.W. Bush or Jimmy Carter because they served only one term each.)Where does all this leave us? First, under the most common yardstick for measuring employment -- the CES data -- Boehner's claim is significantly overstated. Second, while Boehner is closer when using a different statistic, it\u2019s only more accurate if he uses a time period much different than the one he stated in the interview. And third, his suggestion that the tax cuts are primarily responsible for subsequent job growth is contentious at best (and the job growth he points to is modest compared to previous administrations).So the numbers Boehner offers are accurate only with significant adjustments. Overall, we find his statement too flawed to give it a rating higher than False.",

        "claim": "Austin is \"a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.\"",
        "doc": "Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, set to relinquish his office after this year, warned in his last \"State of the City\" address that growth continues to pinch. Setting up his pitch for voter approval of an inner-city rail line, Leffingwell said Austin is \"a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.\" Take that, all ye who bemoan how much the city has grown (oh-so crowding the roads) just since you arrived. To our inquiry, mayoral spokesman Reyne Telles told us by email that Leffingwell was referring to population growth, not geographic expansion. Telles added that Leffingwell based his declaration on a chart posted on the city\u2019s web page devoted to local and regional demographics as overseen by Ryan Robinson, the city demographer. The chart shows the city\u2019s population in many of the years from 1840 through 2013. That would cover Austin\u2019s lifetime. An Austin History Center web page says the city, originally Waterloo, was purchased to be the capital of the Republic of Texas in March 1839 and renamed in honor of Stephen F. Austin. The city was incorporated on Dec. 27, 1839. In Austin\u2019s early years, the chart indicates, the population doubled even more frequently than Leffingwell said. Specifically, the population surged six-fold from 1840 to 1860, going from 553 to 3,493, according to the chart, while over the next 20 years, the number of residents increased three-fold, to 11,013. The population doubled in the next 20 years, reaching 22,258 in 1900, the chart shows, before nearly doubling over the next 25 years, reaching 42,174 in 1925, up 90 percent from 1900. It took 15 years for the population to double afresh; it reached 87,930 in 1940, according to the chart. Twenty years later, the chart shows, Austin\u2019s population of 186,545 was more than double its 1940 population. It took 23 years for another doubling, according to the chart, with the 1983 population reaching 373,541. Some 25 years later, in 2008, the city\u2019s population of 750,525 was double its 1983 population, the chart shows. To get the most up-to-date sense of growth from the chart, we also looked at whether the mayor\u2019s claim holds up if we look back in time starting in 2013 when Austin had 842,750 residents. That 2013 tally was almost double the city\u2019s population 25 years earlier. Gauged another way, the 2013 population was more than double Austin\u2019s population of 417,033 in 1985. So, that doubling took 28 years. Telles of the mayor\u2019s office also pointed us to a city report featuring a graphic (below) showing Austin\u2019s population growth since 1900. \"Austin\u2019s growth has been very close to doubling every 20 years,\" the report says. Our ruling Leffingwell said Austin is a \"city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.\" That's right per changes in population, making this historical statement True. TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",

This ridiculous claim can be traced back to satire from 2016. \"NASA announced that it communicated with four races of aliens,\" said a June 23, 2018, headline from The Life Buzz, an online blog. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

This bogus story actually originated as satire on Waterford Whispers News, an Irish site that identifies as \"a satirical newspaper and website\" and \"uses invented names in all its stories,\" according to its disclaimer page. The original article was published Aug. 26, 2016, and is clearly made-up. NASA does not list anyone named Trish Chamberson on its website. In fact, Snopes issued a fact-check in 2016 ofwebsites attempting to republish the Waterford Whispers News article as a real news story. Several similar stories appeared without a disclaimer on blog sites and social media postings during 2016 and 2017.

        "doc": "In the 2020 election, 3,385,294 votes were cast for president in Arizona, and Donald Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by just 10,457 votes \u2014 49.36% to 49.06%. Six months later, a livestreamed but opaque audit of ballots from the state\u2019s most populous county is under way in a 14,870-seat arena. And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden. A widely shared Instagram post claimed: \"Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000. Now as it nears completion nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal. Nearly all for Biden.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) \"There\u2019s no preliminary results,\" Ken Bennett, Arizona\u2019s former secretary of state and a liaison for the Senate Republicans who ordered the audit, told PolitiFact on May 6. \"There\u2019s no such finding. There\u2019s been no findings released to either of those effects.\" The audit, begun April 23, will likely to continue for at least 60 days, Bennett said. He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released. A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote. So the Instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly 90% of Biden\u2019s votes were \"illegal.\" The Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators, even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities. The GOP hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based technology company lacking election audit experience. Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted \"stop the steal\" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. But Cyber Ninja\u2019s policies and procedures were released only after a judge ruled that the firm couldn\u2019t keep them secret. Reporters initially were restricted from taking notes or filing reports. The false claim follows others that we\u2019ve debunked about purported findings from the audit. We rated False a widely shared Facebook claim that the audit found \"a quarter of a million illegal votes,\" given that no results have been released. We also rated False a claim that the audit \"is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark.\" There\u2019s no evidence of any such finding, and Maricopa County says it does not use watermarks on its ballots. A widely shared social media post claimed that an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona \"showed Trump ahead by 250,000\" votes, and \"nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal, nearly all for Biden.\" No findings have been released from an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Ariz., that is being conducted by firms hired by Arizona Senate Republicans. There is no evidence that the audit has turned up any illegal ballots or changes in votes that would give Trump the lead in Arizona. The claim, with its sky-high figures, is false and ridiculous.

Approximately 3.6 million people are registered and roughly 3.3 million people voted in Minnesota, according to official data. In total, the state's estimated voting-eligible population is 4,118,462, making the post's claim of 5.1 million votes illogical. The claim appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) on November 4, 2020. It read: Minnesota had over 5.1 million votes and only 3.8 million registered voters. This is what the post looked like at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Thu Nov 5 19:38:27 2020 UTC) The numbers in the post, which cited no source or attribution, are incorrect. As of November 2, 2020, a day before Election Day, 3,588,563 people were registered to vote, according to the office of the Minnesota secretary of state. By November 5, 2020, that number changed slightly to 3,588,678. Minnesota permits same-day registration, meaning that previously unregistered voters can register at the polls on Election Day. Those numbers are expected to be available soon, Risikat Adesaogun, a spokesperson from the secretary of state's office, told Lead Stories. She also said that ballots are still coming in and being counted, but that estimated voter turnout -- as of November 5, 2020 -- stood at 3,260,017.",

Alt News has already fact-checked five such claims made on the basis of videos and shown that the viral clips are not related to any such attack.In this context, a purported newspaper clipping of Dainik Jagran is widely circulating on social media. The clip is dated March 2. The headline says Hindi-speaking labourers are being killed in Tamil Nadu. It also says that Tamil natives have asked Hindi speakers to vacate the state before March 20. It has a photo of Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin. The text says that Stalin has asked Hindi-speaking migrant workers to leave and that the Tamil Nadu government won't be responsible for whatever happens to them if they don't.It also has a photo of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. There is a quote where he requests workers to return to UP and says that the state will provide employment to them as a number of deaths have occurred in Tamil Nadu.Below we have provided the newspaper cutting.This claim is viral on WhatsApp circles. Alt News has received multiple requests on its helpline (+91 7600011160) to check the veracity of this claim.This slideshow requires JavaScript.This claim is also circulating widely on Facebook.Fact CheckA quick glance at the clipping suggests that it is not genuine as the 'report' is not only incomplete but is also poorly written using Google Input Tools. Some of the errors have been highlighted below:There are also other factors like the usage of English words in the Hindi text, such as 'Tamil person', 'worker' and 'UP me'.Additionally, we also noticed a watermark that reads \"News Banner Maker\". Taking note of this, we found an application of the same name on the Google play store that allows users to make such newspaper cuttings. One of the templates the app has is the same as the viral image.Hence, it is clear that a newspaper clipping created using an app is being falsely shared as a piece of news that says Hindi-speaking migrant workers are being asked to vacate Tamil Nadu as the government will not be providing any protection.Donate to Alt News!Independent journalism that speaks truth to power and is free of corporate and political control is possible only when people contribute towards the same.

        "claim": "\u201c(President Joe) Biden is trying to limit you to two beers per week.\u201d",
        "doc": "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz fumed at President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, claiming it plans to strictly curb Americans\u2019 alcohol consumption. In an interview with Newsmax, the Texas Republican accused the Biden administration of limiting Americans to only two beers a week. \"What is it with liberals that want to control every damn aspect of your life? ... Now these idiots have come out and said, \u2018Drink two beers a week.\u2019 That\u2019s their guideline,\" Cruz told the conservative outlet. \"Well, I\u2019ve got to tell you, if they want us to drink two beers a week, frankly they can kiss my ass.\" Cruz then grabbed a bottle of Shiner Bock, a dark lager, unscrewed the cap and took a swig. Behind him, a cluster of men in cowboy hats and plaid shirts guzzled their own beers. The senator posted the now-viral clip for his 6.1 million followers on X, formerly Twitter. The only problem: No such plan exists. Current U.S. guidelines advise men to limit themselves to two drinks a day and women to one. White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said the suggestion that Biden would prevent Americans from consuming more than two beers a week is \"absolutely false.\" PolitiFact looked for a reference of Biden calling to limit drinking and found none. Cruz spokeswoman Maria Reynolds called this \"yet another trial balloon by the Biden administration for yet another campaign to regulate the behavior of everyday Americans.\" It appears the story unfolded Aug. 28, when Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre whether Biden wants to limit Americans to two beers a week. Appearing bewildered, Jean-Pierre asked for additional context. Doocy pointed to remarks by Dr. George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The agency was founded more than 50 years ago, under President Richard Nixon; its director is appointed by the National Institutes of Health. In his Newsmax interview, Cruz referred to Koob, who was appointed in 2013, as Biden\u2019s \"alcohol czar.\" In an August interview with the Daily Mail, a British news outlet, Koob said the U.S. could revise its alcohol recommendation to match Canada\u2019s, where people are advised to limit themselves to two drinks per week. When Doocy pressed her, Jean-Pierre declined to comment. \"I have no idea,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve not seen the data. I cannot speak to this. I will leave it to the experts and not weigh in.\" Clips of the exchange circulated widely on social media, with many users speculating that the government plans to crack down on how much alcohol Americans consume. Even if the guidelines change, they are not mandates. They are recommendations meant to promote health and prevent disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services jointly issue the guidelines every five years, relying on expertise from policymakers, health care providers, nutrition educators and federal nutrition program operators. Revised guidelines will be issued in 2025, according to the health department. Biden and former President Donald Trump have both said they are teetotalers. Koob told the Daily Mail he enjoys a couple of glasses of white wine per week, usually a California chardonnay. Cruz said, \"Biden is trying to limit you to two beers per week.\" Biden hasn\u2019t said this, nor has he issued any executive action toward that goal. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\u2019s director said the U.S. may consider recommending adults consume only two drinks per week. But even if such a recommendation is issued, it will be a recommendation, not a mandate. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "The wives of the 9/11 hijackers \"knew exactly what was happening\" and went back to Saudi Arabia two days before the attacks to watch their husbands on television flying the planes.",
        "doc": "When the subject turned to terrorism during the March 3 Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Donald Trump called for being tough on the families of terrorists, not just the terrorists themselves. As an example, he resurrected a claim he has made before \u2014 that the wives of the 9/11 terrorists knew what was going to happen and fled the United States to Saudi Arabia just before the attacks. \"A man flies in the World Trade Center and his family gets sent back to where they were going \u2014 and I think most of you know where they went and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq. But they went back to a certain territory. They knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening,\" Trump said. \"They left two days early with respect to the World Trade Center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon and probably trying to fly into the White House except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane.\" During part of the response it sounds like Trump is talking about one wife, but he subsequently makes it clear that he's talking about all of the planes involved in the attack \u2014 actually there were four. So in the same breath he seems to be talking about multiple wives. Trump was clearer during the December 15 GOP debate in Las Vegas when he said that friends, family, girlfriends \"were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.\" Regardless, Trump\u2019s account of what happened in September 2001 doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Of all the hijackers, not one had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the United States during the days or months leading up to the hijackings, according to the 9/11 Commission report. Not all were pinpointed, but \"they sure weren\u2019t living in the United States,\" Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told PolitiFact in mid-December. In fact, only two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend, and she was living in Germany. The commission concluded that most of the 19 hijackers had \"broken off regular contact with their families\" long before the attacks, except for the hijacker with the girlfriend in Germany. He was on the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Investigators concluded after extensive interviews that she knew nothing about the plot. Trump\u2019s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden\u2019s extended family -- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself -- a few days after the attack. Most of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia. But it seems clear Trump wasn't talking about them. And the fact that some of those relatives were evacuated from the United States for their protection doesn't make what Trump said during the Fox debate any more accurate. Trump's claim is False. The wives of the 9/11 hijackers \"knew exactly what was happening\" and went back to Saudi Arabia two days before the attacks to watch their husbands on television flying the planes.",

        "claim": "\u201cNew York state has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands.\u201d",
        "doc": "New York state Sen. Sean M. Ryan, who represents a district that runs north and south of Buffalo, recently wrote an op-ed that urged increasing conservation protections for wetlands. \"New York's wetlands are important to nearly every living being in our state,\" Ryan wrote in the op-ed, which originally appeared on March 3 on the website of the conservation group Ducks Unlimited. \"They provide critical habitat for species like ducks, deer, and turkeys \u2013 and you may already know that they are home to nearly half of the threatened and endangered species in the state.\" Ryan added that other benefits of wetlands range \"from absorbing flooding and storm surge, to filtering water of pollutants and acting as one of the most effective carbon sinks,\" which helps mitigate climate change. In the op-ed, Ryan outlined the scope of wetland losses in recent decades. \"Despite all of these benefits, our wetlands are constantly under threat,\" Ryan wrote in the op-ed. \"New York state has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands.\" The 99% figure seemed high, so we checked with Ryan\u2019s office. Cody Meyers, Ryan\u2019s chief of staff, acknowledged to PolitiFact New York that the figure was mistaken. Meyers said the 99% figure referred to the percentage of wetland habitat losses since 1600 in New York City, rather than New York state. After we contacted Ryan\u2019s office about the percentage, they changed the figure in the op-ed to 60%, where it remains. But what about the 60% figure? Is it accurate? The figure stems from a 1991 report titled, \"Wetlands: Status and Trends in the Coterminous United States, Mid-1970s to Mid-1980s.\" The report was co-authored by two specialists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency. The report determined that New York state had lost 60% of its wetlands by the end of the 1980s. It was one of 22 states that had lost at least half of their wetlands by then, the report said. The 60% figure also appears in another federal report from 1990, \"Wetlands: Losses in the United States, 1780s to 1980s.\" However, these reports are more than 30 years old. In fact, in his op-ed, Ryan acknowledges the difficulty of using old data: He writes that one of the shortcomings with current state wetlands law is that it only protects wetlands \"12.4 acres and larger that appear on a set of jurisdictional maps. These maps were created in the 1970s and 1980s with outdated technology, leading to nearly 1 million acres of wetlands lacking any state-level protection.\" So we checked with independent experts to see if any more recent data existed. Tom Langen, a professor of biology at Clarkson University, told PolitiFact New York that he wasn\u2019t aware of any comprehensive studies in the last two decades. One study published in 2000, \"Wetlands Status and Trend Analysis of New York State Mid-1980\u2019s to Mid-1990\u2019s,\" found a net gain of 17,619 acres of wetlands from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s in five geographic zones in New York state. The gains were largely due to farmland abandonment, beaver proliferation, and restoration efforts. However, these increases accounted for less than 1% of the state\u2019s existing wetlands acreage, They also didn\u2019t encompass the entire state, making it hard to draw broader conclusions. Overall, Langen said, he\u2019s doubtful that there\u2019s been a substantial change from the 60% figure. Nicholas A. Robinson, an emeritus professor of law at Pace University who specializes in environmental law, agreed that it\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s been a significant change in wetland cover since the studies in the early 1990s, and that 60% is likely still a safe figure to use. The scale of historical losses is so significant, Robinson said, that \"measures are needed to curb that rate of loss.\" Ryan said, \"New York State has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands.\" New York state has not lost 99% of its wetlands. Ryan\u2019s office acknowledged that they had mistakenly used the figure for New York City, and they changed the figure to 60% after we inquired. The 60% figure dates back to federal studies published in the early 1990s. That means their data is more than 30 years old. However, the limited studies that have been conducted since then have found only modest changes in wetland cover, and several experts said they do not expect that the percentage of wetland loss has changed dramatically during the past three decades. We rate the original 99% figure Mostly False. CLARIFICATION, March 30, 2022: The version of the op-ed that was published in Ducks Unlimited always included the 60% figure. Only the version published on Ryan\u2019s Senate site initially used the 99% figure, according to his office. Our rating remains unchanged.",

Two readers asked VERA Files Fact Check to look into a manipulated GMA News and Public Affairs graphic uploaded June 2 and 3 by several netizens on Facebook (FB), attributing to Robredo the fabricated statement: \u201cPwede naman pong mag basketball pero dapat may social distance sa bawat player Kahit mga 3 meters away (You can play basketball but there should be social distance between each player of about 3 meters).\u201d She said no such thing. The fake quote even contradicts what she said during the May 31 episode of her radio show BISErbisyong Leni, where she said contact sports like basketball would still be disallowed under a more relaxed quarantine setup. In her program, Robredo talked about the outdoor activities not allowed under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) but which can now be done under a less restrictive general community quarantine (GCQ). \u201c[N]oong ECQ binawal talaga yung pag-exercise sa labas ng bahay. Ngayon sa GCQ, pwede na yung outdoor exercises pero non-contact yung sports\u2026 so pwede na yung golf. Yung basketball hindi pa pwede kasi contact sports iyon (During the ECQ, outdoor exercises were totally prohibited. Under the GCQ now, outdoor exercises are allowed as long as the sport is non-contact\u2026 so golf is now allowed. Basketball is not yet allowed because that is a contact sport),\u201d said Robredo. The fake quote card twisted her comments on basketball during her radio show and followed the publication on her official FB page of a video giving safety tips on the reopening of offices under the GCQ. Among the the tips is to practice social distancing of about one meter or three feet. This is not the first time disinformation publishers attributed an incredulous health advice to the vice president. Editing the same March 15 GMA News and Public Affairs graphic, netizens claimed Robredo told the public to \u201csuck in their cough\u201d to avoid infecting others with COVID-19 in March. Two more fake quote cards on Robredo using News5 templates also surfaced in March. VERA Files Fact Check flagged at least two netizens and two FB pages \u2014 SOLID Duterte and Duterte WatchTower & Phils. Travel \u2014 that published the fabricated \u2018basketball advice\u2019 graphic. It collectively has over 1,200 shares, and could have reached more than 116,000 people. A day after Duterte WatchTower & Phils. Travel published its post, it edited its caption to include a disclaimer saying it did not claim Robredo made the statement. However, the graphic clearly shows Robredo\u2019s name under the statement, alongside her photo. Duterte WatchTower & Phils. Travel was created in November 2016, SOLID Duterte last April 16.

        "doc": "Screenshots from the video that claimed to show the crash of China's Boeing 737-800 aircraft that was carrying 132 people. A China Eastern Airlines' Boeing 737-800 aircraft carrying 132 people crashed on March 21 in South China\u2019s Guangxi region. An official statement on the cause of the accident and the number of dead is still awaited. No survivors were found in the crash at the time of writing this. Amid this, a video of an aeroplane crashing down vertically was circulated on social media with claims that it showed the ill-fated Chinese plane. The archived version of the post can be seen here. The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim along with the video to be misleading. This is an old video that has also been circulated as from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. AFWA probe We ran a reverse image search of the keyframes of the video in question and found the same video uploaded by several social media users at least since March 13, 2022. This confirmed that the video is old and not related to the March 21 plane crash in China. As per these posts, the video shows a Russian jet shot down by Ukraine forces in Kharkiv. Berlin-based journalist Julian R\u00f6pcke tweeted the same video on March 13 as from the Ukraine-Russia war. He also tweeted a second video saying it showed the two pilots of the jet on their way down on parachutes.

The report also reiterated that the video showed a two-manned Russian jet being shot down by Ukraine's defence forces. As per this report, on the same day, Kharkiv's regional governor Oleh Synyehubov through Telegram confirmed that a Russian jet had been shot down in the region. While we couldn\u2019t independently verify the source of the video in question, it is clear that the video is old and not related to the Boeing 737 crash in China.

        "claim": "\"The president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion debt.\"",
        "doc": "When the Treasury Department announced on Sept. 4 that the national debt had topped $16 trillion, the Associated Press reported, Barack Obama's GOP rivals \"used the grim-but-expected news to criticize the president for the government's fiscal performance over his 3 1/2 years in office.\"Among the leaders who issued news releases was House Speaker John Boehner.Instead of working to cut the deficit, the Ohio Republican said, \"the president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt.\"PolitiFact Ohio was interested. Does spending under Obama break down to a $50,000-per-person share of the national debt?We asked Boehner's office for more information.They responded that the speaker \"has often talked about President Obama\u2019s stimulus-fueled spending binge\" and called it \"a reference to his entire approach to economic policy, not just one bill ...\"It's the strategy Obama has pursued since taking office: spend more, refuse to make cuts and reforms where needed because, he argues, such cuts and reforms would hurt the economy. Under his presidency,\" Boehner\u2019s staff said, \"our national debt has increased by $5 trillion and has brought the total share in debt for every American to $50,000. We would not have reached that level of debt on September 4th without the contribution of his economic policies.\"The cost per person is accurate, and even a little understated. With population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau at roughly 314.4 million, the average share works out to about $50,900.The national debt has risen more than $5.4 trillion from its level of $10.6 trillion when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009.But can that all be tied to Obama's spending? It\u2019s a question we\u2019ve addressed before.In May, PolitiFact looked at historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and calculated the average spending increases per year for 10 presidents over the past 60 years (skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure).Using raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation), Obama oversaw the lowest annual increases of spending among them. Jimmy Carter had the highest, followed by Richard Nixon.PolitiFact also did a recalculation because of the special case of 2009, which came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation\u2019s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. The 2009 fiscal year began four months before Obama moved into the White House, and its major spending decisions were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress.The recalculation shifted spending from Bush to Obama for the economic stimulus package, an expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, an incremental increase in appropriations over Bush's level and the Troubled Asset Relief Program.That shift moved Obama from last place in spending increases to either second from the bottom or third from the bottom.Using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase in average annual spending. In fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account. (Lyndon Johnson was highest on that chart; Dwight Eisenhower was lowest.)So why the disconnect between Obama\u2019s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown?First, Obama\u2019s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year.The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven\u2019t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts.And each year there\u2019s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid.Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending.Finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- commonly called the stimulus -- sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans.FactCheck.org found the spending Obama inherited \"was so high that even modest increases keep it at a level that is extraordinarily lofty by historical standards.\" As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the nation's economic production, spending is running at the highest level since the 1940s.But tax revenues are also low by historical standards, FactCheck.org found, and are at their lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1950.Boehner\u2019s claim included an accurate estimate of what the national debt of $16 trillion would cost per person.But his claim stated that as a result of a presidential \"stimulus-fueled spending binge\" every American man, woman, and child\" was stuck with a $50,000 share of the $16 trillion debt. That\u2019s an overreach.The debt grew to $16 trillion not just because of Obama's actions, but also due to actions taken by present and past presidents and Congresses.The stimulus package came with a $787 billion price tag. If you include all growth in the national debt under the Obama administration, it\u2019s roughly $5.4 trillion, not $16 trillion. The administration inherited a national debt of more than $10 trillion when it came into office.But Boehner\u2019s claim saddles the administration with responsibility for all of the $16 trillion.On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner\u2019s claim rates False.",

        "doc": "A Facebook post misrepresents a study looking at the effect on cancer of a substance found in ginger. The post includes a photograph of a piece of ginger with the text \"Scientists Find Ginger Kills 91% Of Leukemia Cells And Shrinks Tumors In Vivo\". In fact the study , which was published 10 years ago and is summarised in an article cited by the caption on the post, investigates the effects of a substance in ginger, not ginger itself. Researchers looked at 6-shogaol (6S), a substance derived from ginger, rather than the food. They conducted both in vitro (in a test tube or petri dish) and in vivo (in a living organism) experiments. They did find that leukaemia cells treated with 6S died at a greater rate than those not treated. The 91% figure isn't actually noted in the paper, but one value on one of the charts appears to be approximately 91%. Even so, this only applied to one of several cancer lines tested in different ways, and this was in vitro, not in vivo. The reduction rate was lower in other groups of cells. It also didn't find that the substance \"shrinks\" tumours. The tumour experiment was in vivo, using fourteen mice, and the researchers reported that tumours treated with 6S grew less quickly than tumours that were not treated. Medications are usually extensively trialled in vitro and then in vivo before any human trial would begin. As the article says, this study \"does not mean that ginger is considered a proven anti-cancer medicine. That would require many more studies \u2013 including human trials.\" Ginger may be useful for treating nausea and vomiting , but there is no evidence that it can be used to treat or cure cancer. Bad information about possible cancer treatments can cause harm if people use it to make decisions about their health. We have written several times about false claims in this area. As Cancer Research UK says, alternative therapies \" may be harmful or could interact with other treatments you're having \" and \"You could harm your health if you stop your cancer treatment for an unproven treatment .\" Image courtesy of Karolina Grabowska",

        "claim": "In 1994, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout built a nuclear reactor in his mother\u2019s backyard, an act that ultimately necessitated a Superfund cleanup.",
        "doc": "On 10 May 1991, a 14-year-old Boy Scout named David Hahn earned an Atomic Energy merit badge, the first (and likely only) person in the history of Troop 371 in Clinton Township, Michigan, to receive a badge in that discipline: David was awarded his Atomic Energy merit badge on May 10, 1991, five months shy of his fifteenth birthday. To earn it he made a drawing showing how nuclear fission occurs, visited a hospital radiology unit to learn about the medical uses of radioisotopes and built a model reactor using a juice can, coat hangers, soda straws, kitchen matches, and rubber bands. By now, though, David had far grander ambitions. Throughout his childhood, Hahn had been obsessed with chemistry, teaching himself everything he knew from encyclopedias, textbooks, and chemistry sets, while personal safety did not seem to be a concern of his. According to a 1998 Harper\u2019s profile of Hahn written by Ken Silverstein, \u201cHe once appeared at a scout meeting with a bright orange face caused by an overdose of canthaxanthin, which he was taking to test methods of artificial tanning.\u201d In another instance, he was held responsible for a blowing a large hole in the wall of a Boy Scout tent after accidentally igniting a stockpile of powdered magnesium he had brought along. His \u201claboratory\u201d was eventually moved to the potting shed behind his mother\u2019s house, after an incident in his father\u2019s basement that did not go as planned: One night as [Hahn\u2019s father and stepmother] were sitting in the living room watching TV, the house was rocked by an explosion in the basement. There they found David lying semiconscious on the floor, his eyebrows smoking. Unaware that red phosphorus is pyrophoric, David had been pounding it with a screwdriver and ignited it. After achieving the rank of Eagle Scout, Hahn decided he wanted to experiment with real radioactivity, not merely the models he had used to earn his badge. He created various radioactive devices, including two different \u201cneutron guns\u201d that emitted radioactive particles, and eventually decided he wanted to create a \u201cbreeder reactor\u201d \u2014 an energy generating nuclear reactor that actually produces more fissile material than it consumes (by essentially turning material around it radioactive). The concept was popular in the 1970s but for the most part has been abandoned thanks to modern technology and geologic finds that make mining uranium more cost-efficient. The breeder reactor concept was described by the Department of Energy in 1971 as follows: A breeder is a reactor that produces more fuel than it consumes \u2026 If the breeder can be used in a nuclear power plant, it can provide the heat needed for the generation of electricity and simultaneously produce an excess of fissionable material that can be used to fuel other plants. The answer to this apparent contradiction is that breeder reactors do not give \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, but produce usable fissionable material from comparatively useless fertile material at a greater rate than the original fuel in the reactor is consumed in the fissioning process. The obvious question is how would an adolescent working out of his mother\u2019s potting shed acquire fissile material to play around with? This is where Hahn\u2019s myopic focus and determination really shined: Many household products (and even more in the 1990s) contain radioactive material, but the problem is scale. Hahn exploited several commonly found products and used his knowledge of chemistry to extract and concentrate it to create radioactivity at levels \u201cnot found in nature.\u201d Early on, one common source of Hahn\u2019s radioactive material came from household smoke detectors, which contain extremely small amounts of the radioactive isotope americium-241 as part of the mechanism that detects smoke. He \u201ccontacted smoke-detector companies and claimed that he needed a large number of the devices for a school project.\u201d To obtain the radioactive isotope thorium-232, Hahn recalled a fact he had learned as an Eagle Scout: that the mantle of gas lanterns contains traces of the radioactive material. So he purchased \u201cthousands of lantern mantles from surplus stores and, using the blowtorch, reduced them into a pile of ash.\u201d This method produced radiation levels \u201c9,000 times the level found in nature and 170 times the level that requires [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] licensing.\u201d Radium-226, he learned, was found in the paint of antique luminescent clocks. Hahn was able to find an antique can of the mildly radioactive paint in a clock at a nearby antique store, which he used to isolate the isotope for experiments. Tritium, he found, was used as a component of glow-in-the-dark gun and bow sights, which he repeatedly purchased and returned as part of a scheme to collect the material. Hahn \u201cremoved the tritium contained in a waxy substance inside the sights, and then, using a variety of pseudonyms, returned the sights to the store or manufacturer for repair\u2014each time collecting another tiny quantity of tritium.\u201d These purchases were not the only instances in which Hahn employed subterfuge to obtain radioactive material. Claiming to be a professor, he once wrote to a Czechoslovakian firm that sells uranium to commercial and university buyers, obtaining a few samples of material which contained uranium-235 and uranium-238. \u201cIgnoring any thought of safety,\u201d as Harper\u2019s described it, he attempted to build a reactor using the radioactive material he had collected over the years, using a schematic in his father\u2019s college chemistry textbook as his guide: [Hahn] took the highly radioactive radium and americium out of their respective lead casings and, after another round of filing and pulverizing, mixed those isotopes with beryllium and aluminum shavings, all of which he wrapped in aluminum foil. What were once the neutron sources for his guns became a makeshift \u201ccore\u201d for his reactor. He surrounded this radioactive ball with a \u201cblanket\u201d composed of tiny foil-wrapped cubes of thorium ash and uranium powder, which were stacked in an alternating pattern with carbon cubes and tenuously held together with duct tape. While he never achieved the critical mass necessary for a self-sustaining reaction, Hahn certainly appeared to have accomplished the creation of some new fissile material: [Hahn] monitored his \u201cbreeder reactor\u201d \u2026 with his Geiger counter. \u201cIt was radioactive as heck,\u201d he says. \u201cThe level of radiation after a few weeks was far greater than it was at the time of assembly. I know I transformed some radioactive materials. Even though there was no critical pile, I know that some of the reactions that go on in a breeder reactor went on to a minute extent\u201d \u2026 When his Geiger counter began picking up radiation five doors down from his mom\u2019s house, David decided that he had \u201ctoo much radioactive stuff in one place\u201d and began to disassemble the reactor. He placed the thorium pellets in a shoebox that he hid in his mother\u2019s house, left the radium and americium in the shed, and packed most of the rest of his equipment into the trunk of the Pontiac 6000. All of these events took place before the end of 1994, and perhaps they would have remained a secret to this day if Hahn had not stashed the remains of his nuclear reactor in that Pontiac. On 31 August 1994, police responded to complaints that Hahn was in a residential neighborhood \u201cstealing tires from a car.\u201d In their discussion with Hahn, the police ended up performing a search of the car and found: When they opened the trunk they discovered a toolbox shut with a padlock and sealed with duct tape for good measure. The trunk also contained over fifty foil-wrapped cubes of mysterious gray powder, small disks and cylindrical metal objects, lantern mantles, mercury switches, a clock face, ores, fireworks, vacuum tubes, and assorted chemicals and acids. The police were especially alarmed by the toolbox, which David warned them was radioactive and which they feared was an atomic bomb. The discovery of the radioactive contents of Hahn\u2019s trunk \u201cautomatically triggered the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, and state officials soon were embroiled in tense phone consultations with the DOE, EPA, FBI, and NRC.\u201d After examining his mother\u2019s property (which she had cleansed of the most radioactive material in advance of law enforcement searches of the property for fear she would lose her home), authorities decided that the site was to be an EPA clean-up operation: A Superfund cleanup took place between June 26 and 28 at a cost of about $60,000. After the moon-suited workers dismantled the potting shed with electric saws, they loaded the remains into thirty-nine sealed barrels placed aboard a semitrailer bound for Envirocare, a dump facility located in the middle of the Great Salt Lake Desert. There, the remains of [Hahn\u2019s] experiments were entombed along with tons of low-level radioactive debris from the government\u2019s atomic-bomb factories, plutonium-production facilities, and contaminated industrial sites. Hahn fell into a deep depression following this episode, according to Harper\u2019s, which was likely exacerbated by his mother\u2019s suicide in 1996. He enlisted in the armed forces and spent four years in the U.S. Navy followed by some time in the Marines Corps before returning to his home state of Michigan. In 2007 the FBI investigated claims that Hahn was storing radioactive material in his apartment. In an interview with the FBI, Hahn described his honorable discharge from the military and his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia in the years following his return home: Hahn advised that prior to joining the Navy in May, 1997, he got into trouble for stealing tires and rims from a vehicle. Hahn stated he was in the Navy for approximately five and a half years as a internal communication specialist as well as various other positions. Hahn said he then received his associates from Macomb Community College for Applied Science in Criminal Justice. Hahn advised that he then enlisted in the Marines in 2004. Hahn stated he was a truck driver for approximately a year and a half before he was honorably discharged. Hahn said after a few months living with his [REDACTED], Hahn moved to his current residence. Hahn advised that he does not currently have a job. Hahn stated he is on disability because he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Hahn said he also has radiation poisoning from his prior contact with radioactive substances. Hahn advised that he is compliant with all his medications most of the time. Hahn stated he occasionally drinks while he is on his medications. Hahn ran into trouble with the law for stealing smoke detectors in 2007 as well, and he experienced repeated drug-related incidents in the years following. He died on 27 September 2016 at the age of 39, a death which was the result of alcohol poisoning, his father said: Citing a toxicology and autopsy report, Kenneth Hahn said his son was found with a dangerous level of blood alcohol content, 0.404, late in the evening on September 26, 2016 \u2026 Prior to his death, [Kenneth] Hahn accompanied his son to the Veterans Administration hospital for quarterly routine checkups. Medical staff there found no lingering ill effects from the earlier radiation exposure. Hahn\u2019s story first came to public light in the 1998 Harper\u2019s profile written by Ken Silverstein. Silverstein later expanded that piece into the book The Radioactive Boy Scoutwhich was in turn optioned for a feature film in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my son and I\u2019m very sad that he\u2019s gone,\u201d Kenneth Hahn told Ars Technica in March 2017. \u201cHe could have done a lot more in this world.\u201d",

        "claim": "\"At this particular point in time, looking at the field, there\u2019s only one individual that\u2019s ever had the uniform of his country on\u2014and that\u2019s me.\"",
        "doc": "Rick Perry stresses his military service in a web ad noted by Politico on Feb. 27, 2015, describing himself as unique among milling presidential prospects. \"At this particular point in time, looking at the field,\" Perry tells listeners around a table, \"there\u2019s only one individual that\u2019s ever had the uniform of his country on\u2014and that\u2019s me.\" The Politico story went on: \"No other 2016 presidential contender \u2014 except for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), arguably a long-shot candidate \u2014 has served in the military.\" According to the Associated Press, Graham said in January 2015 he\u2019d set up a committee to explore running for president. Perry\u2019s biographical entry, on his website, says: \"Between 1972 and 1977, Perry served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East.\" And when the then-governor of Texas ran for president in 2012, he was nearly the only candidate with a military record, The Washington Post said in an Aug. 16, 2011, news blog post; the only other candidate with military experience was Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, formerly a flight surgeon in the Air Force and the Air Force National Guard. Paul has since left the House and the presidential hustings, seemingly giving buoyance to this new claim. Prospects who have worn the uniform Perry aides did not respond to our inquiry about how Perry reached his \"only one individual\" conclusion. So we don\u2019t know why he overlooked Graham, whose time as an Air Force lawyer is mentioned in his Senate biographical entry. By email, Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said Graham was a senior prosecutor at Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Germany from 1984-1988. He left active duty in 1989, but remains a colonel in the Air Force Reserves, Bishop said. It's worth noting, too, that no candidate has already declared for president, a factor leading us to root our review of Perry's declaration in a list of Americans believed to be considering a run. The list is kept up by Politics1.com, a website run by Florida attorney Ron Gunzburger that tracks candidates for federal office. And it looks like besides Perry and Graham, a couple of possible longshot Republican hopefuls could be stumping with military experience: --Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was a U.S. Army counterintelligence agent in West Germany before entering the University of Virginia Law School, from which he graduated in 1977, according to a biographical entry posted by the National Governors Association. Gilmore\u2019s entry in Who\u2019s Who specifies he was an Army agent in West Germany from 1971-74. In December 2014, Gilmore declined to rule out a presidential bid in an interview with The Washington Post. --Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who like Perry spoke at the February 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference, spent time in the National Guard (signing up, he\u2019s said, because he wanted to diminish his chances of dying in a rice paddy in Vietnam). In January 2015, The Boston Globe quoted Bolton, then about to venture to New Hampshire (home to the nation\u2019s first-every-four-years presidential primaries), saying he was considering a run for president. Democrat fought in Vietnam In his video, Perry--who has said he\u2019ll reveal if he\u2019s running for president in May or June 2015--didn\u2019t say if he was limiting his focus to Republicans. If not, he also overlooked former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, who was a Marine in Vietnam before later serving as Secretary of the Navy. Webb served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1972 as a second lieutenant and platoon commander in Vietnam, according to Who\u2019s Who. In a video posted online as he launched his presidential exploratory committee in November 2014, Webb said: \"I came from a family of citizen-soldiers\" including his father, a 26-year pilot. \"My brother, my son and I all became Marines. I fought on one of the Vietnam war\u2019s harshest battlefields,\" Webb said, adding that he spent eight years on active duty. Bush to Walker to Biden to O\u2019Malley; no military service touted Biographical information posted online by more than a dozen other possible Republican candidates or groups didn\u2019t reveal a personal military record for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; surgeon Ben Carson; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; business executive Carly Fiorina; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Indiana Gov. Mike Pence; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder; and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Similarly, possible Democratic aspirants--Vice President Joe Biden; former Secretary of State/former Sen. Hillary Clinton; and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley--show no military background in their lives. What to make of all of this? Next, we queried a Duke University political scientist, Peter Feaver, who offered his opinion by email: \"If the field of prospects is limited to what Gov. Perry would plausibly consider to be the Republican top tier, meaning those who poll at his level or higher, then his statement is demonstrably true. None of the Republican candidates that are currently running ahead of Perry in the polls has served in uniform.\" Feaver continued: \"If the field of prospects is expanded to include every person who has expressed an interest in running for president, then of course some of that vast multitude have served in uniform.\" Our ruling In a web video, Perry said: \"At this particular point in time, looking at the field, there\u2019s only one individual that\u2019s ever had the uniform of his country on\u2014and that\u2019s me.\" Perhaps Perry\u2019s definition of the \"field\" leaves out possible aspirants who haven\u2019t surged in early polls. We also can see Perry making a case for being the best-known possible Republican nominee with military experience. However, there are others who might bid\u2014a sitting senator, another former governor, a former ambassador and a Democratic former senator\u2014who also were in the military. On balance, we rate his absolute statement Half True. HALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

        "doc": "The figures provided by Mike Lindell exceed the realm of possibility, and no sources for the claims have been provided. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has claimed that he possesses enough evidence to put over 300 million US citizens \u201cin prison for life\u201d in an interview with conservative news channel Real America\u2019s Voice, which aired on Tuesday. \u201cWe have all the pieces of the puzzle. You talk about evidence. We have enough evidence to put everyone in prison for life, 300 and some million people, we have that back all the way to November and December.\u201d This claim is more than a little dubious. Not only has Mike Lindell not provided a source for his claims, but at the time of the election, the total number of eligible voters in the U.S. was only around 213 million, of which only 66.8% (or just under 160 million) cast a ballot. The figure given by Lindell is therefore almost double the total number of ballots that were cast in the 2020 U.S. election. In the interview, Lindell appears to be echoing conspiracy theories concerning the Dominion voting machines used in the 2020 election which have been consistently and repeatedly disproven. No evidence of widespread election fraud has been found, according to numerous agencies and individuals, including the former Trump administration\u2019s attorney general William Barr.",

        "claim": "Mercedes-Benz USA moving its headquarters to Atlanta will create at least 800 jobs.",
        "doc": "The 2014 governor\u2019s race spotlighted two diametrically opposed facts about Georgia\u2019s economy: Different groups ranked the state tops for business at the same time the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation. Georgia\u2019s unemployment rate tumbled to 6.9 percent in December (from 7.2 percent in November), and in January, Mercedes-Benz USA announced it was moving its headquarters to metro Atlanta. Newly re-elected Gov. Nathan Deal touted the move in a press release as \"creating at least 800 jobs\" while repeating the state\u2019s top-ranked business environment. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if that meant the move would create jobs to nudge the needle on Georgia\u2019s unemployment rate \u2013 still stubbornly well above the national 5.6 unemployment rate. In other words, is moving jobs \u2013 in this case, from New Jersey \u2013 the same as creating them? First, it\u2019s worth noting that the 800 figure comes from an incentive letter from the Georgia Department of Economic Development to Mercedes. The state is offering a package of grants, tax credits and \"cost avoidances\" worth $23.3 million. Mercedes-Benz USA CEO Steve Cannon has told several media outlets that the firm expects about 40 percent of its workers to relocate to Atlanta. Using the 800 figure, that means 320 people will move and the firm will need to hire for 480 jobs. So does that translate into \"creating\" 800 jobs? Absolutely, said state Economic Development Commissioner Chris Carr. After all, once the auto company sets up shop here this summer, there will be at least 800 jobs that today don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a net increase of positions, and in an industry that has gradually shifted to the southeast for its manufacturing and office operations. \"This puts Georgia high on the radar for the automotive industry and also for German companies,\" Carr said. \"Whether a Georgian here or new Georgian, Georgians would not have that job except for the sake that Mercedes will move here.\" The qualifier of \"at least\" 800 jobs shows the state is looking at the tax credits as an investment, Carr said. \"You have to play for the long game,\" he said. To an economist, the claim is accurate-ish. Once Mercedes moves here, the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics will show it as 800 jobs in Georgia. Those jobs will do the things economists study, like boost demand for housing and increase tax collections on the state and local level, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University. That said, it\u2019s incorrect to imply the move means 800 jobs for current Georgians, Seaman said. \"We should be happy, not euphoric. We could be euphoric if this was creating 800 opportunities for existing Georgians,\" he said. The distinction between those soon-to-be Georgians and the folks who already know the pain that is rush hour on the top-end Perimeter? The folks here are the ones paying the taxes that fund those incentives and might wonder what\u2019s in it for them. Georgia\u2019s generous incentives to the film industry answer the question. There was no doubt that most of the jobs tied, say, to Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s first days filming in Bellwood Quarry, came from California. But Seaman said the state\u2019s investment has also created a growing demand for Georgians who know how to do work in that industry, not to mention private-sector investments in sound stages and studios. \"Over time, it is an investment that can pay off,\" Seaman said. \"I think it\u2019s a good thing for the state.\" The bottom line is, claiming Mercedes\u2019 move will create 800 jobs is generally correct but lacking in context. If you\u2019re an unemployed Georgian today, you likely have a shot at 480 Mercedes job openings, not 800. But there should still be 800 jobs, once it\u2019s all said and done. And that alone could spur more work. We rate the claim Mostly True.",

The Assam government did announce financial help for priests recently, but it is a one-time aid and not a monthly stipend. Stipends for priests and imams have always been a thorny issue in India. However, more and more states have announced allowances for religious figures a step endorsed by some and disapproved by others. More recently, a postcard circulating on social media claims the Himanta Biswa Sarma government in Assam will now provide financial aid worth Rs 15,000 to temple priests every month. The text in Hindi translates to, \u201cThe Himanta Biswa Sarma government in Assam has decided to provide financial aid worth Rs 15,000 to temple priests every month. At least there\u2019s someone after Yogi ji who\u2019s bothered about Hindus. Kudos to Yogi ji and Himanta dada.\u201d India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The Assam government did announce financial help for priests recently, but it is a one-time aid and not a monthly stipend. Also, there are conditions the beneficiaries need to meet to get the money. The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. AFWA probe Using keywords, we searched the Internet for news reports on the issue and came across an article published by \u201cIndia Today\u201d on November 5. The article says the Assam government will provide a \u201cone-time financial grant\u201d of Rs 15,000 to temple priests who faced difficulties during the pandemic. State health minister Keshab Mahanta had announced the same after a cabinet meeting on November 4. On the same day, Sarma tweeted three infographics on key decisions taken at the cabinet meet. The second postcard, which mentions about the aid to temple priests and namghorias of namghors (Vaishnavite place of worship), reiterates that it is a one-time grant. Using keywords in Assamese, we found the video of Keshab Mahanta\u2019s press conference. The minister says in Assamese, \u201cPriests and Namghorias faced several difficulties managing their livelihood during the Covid-19 pandemic when our temples and namghors were closed. Keeping this in mind, I have decided to give them a one-time aid of Rs 15,000.\u201d Adding a few conditions to this, Mahanta said the beneficiary has to be a permanent resident and member of the temple or namghor committee. The said committee will also have to confirm the applicant\u2019s identity. One needs to be at least 40 years old to avail the benefit. Also, while applying, the applicants have to mention their annual income which can\u2019t exceed Rs 3 lakh. An online portal will be opened for registration, whose details will be advertised later, he added. Therefore, it is clear that the Assam government has not announced any monthly aid for priests as is being claimed. (Inputs from Riddhish Dutta in Kolkata) INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim The Himanta Biswa Sarma government in Assam has decided to provide financial aid worth Rs 15,000 to temple priests every month. Conclusion On November 4, the Assam government announced a set of schemes, including Rs 15,000 as financial aid to priests. However, it is a one-time grant that will be paid to priests who faced difficulties during the Covid-19 pandemic.

        "doc": "One of the several forms of political clickbait that has sprung up in the online world in recent years the false attribution of controversial and inflammatory political statements to various celebrities, a form that has already appropriated the name of notables such as Sandra Bullock, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.

        "claim": "Sheldon Whitehouse and 18 other senators \"voted to censor the internet.\"",
        "doc": "As the WikiLeaks controversy rages and concerns about web censorship in China percolate, another Internet debate has erupted closer to home.Bloggers, legal scholars, tech gurus and a host of others have accused 19 U.S. senators, Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse among them, of voting to censor the Internet.The claims are intense -- hundreds of them sprinkled all over the Internet -- and they are angry.The vote they're talking about happened Nov. 18, when the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the \"Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act,\" a bill they say would help the Justice Department crack down on websites that \"sell or distribute\" counterfeit or illegally copied goods, such as music or prescription medication.If passed, the law would allow the U.S. attorney general to seek a court order to block a web address \"dedicated to infringing activities,\" in other words, sites whose only function is to traffic in counterfeit or unauthorized goods. If and only if a judge were to agree, the federal government could order the Internet provider to essentially remove that site from public view. The site wouldn't actually be gone. It would still be available through its I.P. address, a numerical identification code, for users savvy enough to find it that way.The goal of the infringement bill is to curb online piracy and protect intellectual property by policing sites that violate the policy, according to its co-sponsor and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\"Rogue websites are essentially digital stores selling illegal and sometimes dangerous products. If they existed in the physical world, the store would be shuttered immediately and the proprietors arrested,\" Leahy wrote in a Dec. 7 commentary in The Hill, a congressional publication. \"There is no excuse for this behavior simply because it happens online and owners operate overseas. The internet needs to be free -- not lawless.\"The bill awaits consideration by the full Senate, which probably won't take up the issue before the lame-duck session ends.But that didn't stop the buzz on the blogosphere. That same day, Wired.com posted a story under the headline \"Web censorship bill sails through Senate committee.\" Techdirt, a leading technology blog, offered its own version: \"The 19 Senators who voted to censor the Internet.\"Buttressing those allegations was a strongly worded letter to the committee from a group of 49 prominent law professors who offered a grim assessment: \"For the first time, the United States would be requiring Internet service providers to block speech because of its content.\"First amendment groups and others expressed similar opposition.The bill may be meant to target counterfeiters and pirates, but skeptics say they worry that, regardless of the original intent, it could create a framework that might one day allow zealous judges to block sites such as YouTube and Facebook, where users may unwittingly share copyrighted material. The threat to free speech is hard to ignore, they say.\"The genesis of law is to go after the worst of the worst offenders, but I fear it\u2019s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line,\" said David L. Hudson Jr., a scholar at the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University.Those opposed say the legislation would also allow the Justice Department to blacklist websites with limited judicial review, blocking access to them through \"prior restraint\" before it is determined that the site is operating unlawfully.Above all, critics say the bill threatens the very freedoms that make the Internet's flow of ideas so valuable.\"One thing people are really worried about is a worst case scenario -- for example, a politically biased AG using the bill if it became law to shut down a website just because he or she doesn\u2019t agree with it,\" said Roger Williams University School of Law Assistant Prof. Zoe Argento, who was among the professors who signed the letter to Congress.Argento cited the potential example of a blogger reprinting large portions of former President George W. Bush's new memoir for the purposes of criticizing it. A politically motivated attorney general could use the law to block the website, as opposed to going through the traditional process of a legal challenge where both sides are heard.On the other side of this very heated issue, supporters, among them the entertainment industry and even the American Newspaper Association, say something must be done to protect intellectual property from online thieves. As of now, there are only a few means of recourse against such infringement: going after the individuals -- college students, etc. -- who purchased counterfeit materials, or by suing Internet service providers, thereby engaging in a protracted civil court battle. The infringement legislation, they say, will allow them to use the federal justice system to go straight to the source of a costly problem.They dismiss concerns about the bill's so-called slippery slope, stressing the rigorous judicial review that all cases would have to undergo to ensure that the law applies. Websites can be blocked only if the U.S. attorney general can prove that it \"has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than\" to traffic in infringed or counterfeit goods.In instances when copyrighted material has been stolen, the original, legitimate site will not be touched. \"The law is meant to go after offenders who are the worst of the worst violators of intellectual property law. They are profiting off others work and the Supreme Court has held that such violations are not protected speech,\" said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for Whitehouse.Leahy in his commentary piece agreed. \"Some have argued the conduct should be excused as free speech because it happens on the Internet,\" he wrote. \"That argument contradicts the basic tenet of copyright law, which, as Justice [Sandra Day] O'Connor explained, is the very 'engine of free expression.' \"Even if you believe the bill is flawed, said Villanova School of Law Associate Prof. Michael Risch, \"when you view it in the most technical way, it's not censorship because the website is still up, you can still get to it through the I.P. address.\"Now back to the initial claim. It's clear the 19 senators voted unanimously to approve the bill, but does that constitute censoring the Internet? We argue that it does not. Censorship is defined as the deletion of speech or content considered objectionable. For example, when the Chinese blocked websites related to Tiananmen Square, that was censorship.In this case, the sites this law could be applied to do not offer free speech of any kind, they distribute stolen or counterfeit goods. Even if you don't agree with that interpretation, consider what Hudson of the First Amendment Center told us: \"I fear it\u2019s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line.\"The key there is the phrase \"down the line.\" That may well be true. The threat of censorship could loom. But we simply do not know that for sure. And that was not the intention of the senators who voted in favor of the bill.Had the bloggers proclaimed that the vote \"could lead to censorship,\" they'd be offering an opinion and we'd let them off the hook. But they didn't qualify their statements. They made bold allegations that relied on conjecture, not fact, thereby declaring that the bill will immediately censor the Internet.It will not.We find this statement False.",

        "claim": "Vote spike charts from 2022 illustrate US election fraud",
        "doc": "\"They are currently stealing Herschel Walkers race with the machines! We are watching everything with Cyber Experts through the EdisonReport at the Real Time Crime Desk,\" Lindell says in a November 8, 2022 post, which shows a line graph tracking vote counts in the US Senate race in Georgia. The charts about races in Georgia, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota were introduced by Jeff O'Donnell, a self-described data analyst who goes by \"The Lone Raccoon\" online, during an election-night livestream that Lindell marketed as an expose of \"real-time crime\" in the US midterms. Lindell later posted screenshots of the charts on Truth Social, Telegram, Instagram and Facebook, where they circulated widely. The charts also generated stories on conspiracy-oriented websites including InfoWars, and O'Donnell uploaded interactive versions to his website, magaraccoon.com. The promotion of the graphs follows Lindell's staunch support for former president Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, which led to lawsuits against the businessman by voting machine companies he wrongly accused of manipulating vote counts in 2020. O'Donnell, who supplied the charts, previously organized a campaign to flood election officials with requests for voting files he believed could prove such claims, according to reports. But there is no evidence that Lindell's charts point to fraud. \"We have seen no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was any way compromised in any race in the country,\" the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement on November 9. Instead, the vote swings for various Democratic candidates that Lindell is framing as malfeasance \"are absolutely typical of how vote counts proceed on election night,\" said Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science and expert on elections technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The same charts, and others like them, show bumps to the Republican vote totals at different times, too. State election officials stressed to AFP that election-night results are always unofficial and that there has been no indication of widespread fraud. \"It is disappointing to see individuals who have repeatedly spread false information that undermines American democracy for their own personal gain continue to make baseless allegations against our election officials,\" said Cassondra Knudson, deputy communications director for the Minnesota Secretary of State. AFP reached out to Lindell and O'Donnell, but no responses were forthcoming. O'Donnell said on Lindell's livestream that he was \"not going to say\" what source he was using to power his charts. Lindell, however, repeatedly referred to the data as coming from Edison Research, a company that provides election data, including unofficial vote counts as they are tallied and reported by election officials, to the National Election Pool, a consortium of US news outlets. Lindell told Lead Stories they scraped that data from CNN. But Rob Farbman, executive vice president of Edison Research, told AFP in an email that Lindell's claims are \"made up lies based on line charts produced by someone we do not even provide data to\" who \"claims elections are fraudulent every time there is an election.\" Farbman compared Lindell's charts to Edison Research's data for AFP and identified benign explanations for each of the vote jumps Lindell cast as suspicious. \"We have no indication of anything unusual in the vote count,\" added Lauren Easton, a spokesperson for the Associated Press, which compiles and records its own preliminary election results as they are reported by officials around the country. Lindell claims that in Georgia -- where the Senate race between Walker, a Republican, and incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is headed to a runoff in December -- the election was being stolen by the voting machines used in the state. But Farbman said the jump in votes for Warnock actually represents the reporting of votes from DeKalb County, the largest county in Georgia, which is heavily Democratic. The unofficial results from DeKalb County, as shown on the Georgia secretary of state's website, show Warnock received more than 84 percent of the vote there. AFP reached out to Georgia election officials. Another of Lindell's posts claims, in reference to the Senate race in Illinois: \"BREAKING! Million vote spike and the only explanation is corrupt electronic voting machines.\" The chart appears to show a spike and subsequent drop in the vote count for Tammy Duckworth, the incumbent Democrat. Farbman said it was the result of a data entry error resulting from a typo that was promptly corrected. \"We added a 9 at the beginning of Duckworth's number in Rock Island,\" Farbman said, noting that the mishap occurred after the race had been called for Duckworth. \"The vote typo was fixed minutes later.\" Similar human errors sparked false claims of fraud in 2020. MIT's Stewart, who helped work the CBS News decision desk on election night, said of such data-entry errors: \"This is one of the reasons we emphasize that the election night returns are unofficial reports of election returns, not the returns themselves.\" Matt Dietrich, public information officer for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said Lindell's conclusions were \"complete nonsense.\" \"All election equipment used in Illinois elections undergoes statutorily required pre-election testing including a public pre-test to ensure accuracy on every ballot voted,\" he added. \"We also run a 5 percent statewide random re-tabulation after the election to ensure complete accuracy in the counting of ballots. There is strict security protocol surrounding the voting equipment and the handling of all ballots. There is no credibility to any claim of 'corrupt' voting machines in Illinois.\" Republican Kathy Salvi, Duckworth's opponent, conceded the race on election night. A third post from Lindell claims, \"They went for the complete steal! ... Minnesota was stolen from Scott Jensen.\" Jensen, a Republican, ran for governor against Democrat Tim Walz. He has likewise conceded. In reality, the swing in votes that Lindell's chart shows for Walz marks the moment Hennepin County, the largest county in the state and a Democratic stronghold, reported votes for the first time of the night, Farbman said. The timing is corroborated by the Minnesota secretary of state's log of unofficial results reported from the county. Knudson, the Minnesota Secretary of State's spokeswoman, said the votes in Hennepin County went for Walz by a wide margin. \"We have no indication of any irregularity,\" Knudson said. \"These claims seem to be based on the faulty assumption that any votes cast for a party other than the one the person making the claim prefers are somehow illegal or not eligible.\" A fourth post from Lindell focuses on the race for attorney general in Michigan. \"Another race being stolen in the middle of the night from Matt DePerno in Michigan,\" the post says. DePerno, the Republican candidate, has conceded to Democrat Dana Nessel. The vote spike Lindell eyed in Michigan is not explained by fraud, but by vote updates from Oakland and Wayne counties, Farbman said. There were \"two very large reports of ballots from Wayne County, the largest and most Democratic county in the state,\" Stewart added. \"Wayne had reported very few votes before then.\" Jake Rollow, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of State, rejected Lindell's claims as \"meritless, false and often nonsensical.\" Election workers in Michigan count absentee ballots through election night and into the next day, Rollow said. \"As jurisdictions finish this process and report their results, the total vote count increases by the total number of votes reported by each jurisdiction.\" AFP has debunked other misinformation about the elections here, here, here and here.",

        "claim": "Elon Musk's Twitter deal has not prompted an urgent Section 230 reform, as social media posts claim",
        "doc": "No fresh announcements were made by the White House on plans to reform Section 230, a law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users. Some online users had claimed that White House spokesperson Jen Psaki had announced plans to reform the law shortly after the news billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk had reached an agreement to buy the social media platform, Twitter. Another commented on Facebook: \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Now that Musk will own Twitter, the White House is concerned about reforming Section 230. Imagine that?????\u201d (here). Other social media posts claiming Section 230 reforms are urgently in focus can be seen (here), (here) and (here). The press secretary made no announcements in relation to Section 230 during the April 25, 2022 briefing. Reforming Section 230 has been a longstanding aim of President Biden, a spokesperson for the White House told Reuters. Section 230 was explicitly mentioned twice during Monday\u2019s briefing in response to questions posed by reporters. The full transcript of the briefing can be found (here) while a livestream of the briefing can be viewed (bit.ly/3LlMeTI). A reporter asked Psaki: \u201cAnd just a quick one on the breaking news: Twitter agreeing to let Elon Musk purchase \u2014 make his \u2014 go through with this purchase. Do you have a response to that? And does the White House have any concern that this new agreement might have President Trump back on the platform?\u201d In response, Psaki said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to comment on a specific transaction ... [Biden] has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal, including reforms to Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency, and more. And he\u2019s encouraged that there\u2019s bipartisan interest in Congress\u201d (here). Another reporter asked: \u201cI\u2019m wondering: Regardless of ownership, would the White House be interested in working with Twitter like it has in the past to continue to combat this kind of misinformation? Or are we in a different part of the pandemic where that kind of partnership is no longer necessary?\u201d Psaki answered: \u201cWell, I think we engage regularly with all social media platforms about steps that can be taken that has continued, and I\u2019m sure it will continue. But there are also reforms that we think Congress could take and we would support taking, including reforming Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency. And the president is encouraged by the bipartisan support for \u2014 or engagement in those efforts\u201d (here). President Biden has previously spoken in support of reforming Section 230, so to present this as a sudden policy decision would be misleading. In an interview with The New York Times editorial board in January 2020, before his victory in the 2020 presidential elections, Biden voiced his view that the law should be revoked immediately (here). In an October 2021 briefing, a reporter asked Psaki: \u201cThanks, Jen. Yesterday's hearing by a Facebook whistleblower underscored several major issues with the company, including, as many senators pointed out, issues with Section 230. On the campaign trail, Biden said that Section 230 should, quote, \"immediately be revoked\" and that it should be revoked because, quote, Facebook \"is not just an Internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false.\" Does the White House stand by that assessment for Section 230, given the revelations now?\u201d (here) Psaki responded: \u201cWell, the President has long said, as you referenced, that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms that they cause. And he has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal. This includes Section 230 reforms. It also includes privacy and antitrust reforms as well as more transparency\u201d (here). In a November 2021 press briefing, Psaki reaffirmed President Biden\u2019s position on Section 230. A reporter posed a question on whether Biden supports revoking the law after the Justice Department defended Section 230 in a lawsuit filed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Psaki responded: \u201c[Biden] called for reforms of Section 230; that continues to be his position\u201d (here). Former U.S. President Donald Trump also expression an intention to revoke Section 230 when he was in office (here). Section 230 was a central talking point during the October 2020 tech hearing, where Democrats and Republicans quizzed \u2018Big Tech\u2019 CEOs on policies (here). Lawmakers have been split on ways to hold Big Tech accountable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content posted by users but also lets the firms shape political discourse. Republican lawmakers used most of their time during the hearing to accuse the companies of selective censorship against conservatives. Democrats primarily focused on insufficient action against misinformation that interferes with the election. In response to several questions discussing the law, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google said Section 230 was crucial to free expression on the internet. They said the law gives them the tools to strike a balance between preserving free speech and moderating content, even as they appeared open to suggestions the law needs moderate changes (here).",

        "claim": "In mid-September 2021, the National Health Service in England announced the world\u2019s first trial for a new cancer-detecting blood test.",
        "doc": "In September 2021, British health officials announced the launch of the world\u2019s largest trial of a blood test capable of detecting more than 50 types of cancer before symptoms appear. Headed by The Cancer Research UK, the National Health Service (NHS) in England, and King\u2019s College London, the so-named Galleri trial aims to recruit 140,000 volunteers across eight areas of England. Galleri checks for the earliest signs of cancer. If it\u2019s successful, its ability to catch cancer during its earliest stages could be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the fight against the disease. \u201cThis quick and simple blood test could mark the beginning of a revolution in cancer detection and treatment here and around the world,\u201d said NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard in a news release. \u201cBy finding cancer before signs and symptoms even appear, we have the best chance of treating it and we can give people the best possible chance of survival.\u201d While its early cancer detection ability holds promise, Galleri does not diagnose cancer and does not detect all forms of the disease. Blood drawn from a participant is tested for chemical changes in fragments of the blood\u2019s genetic code known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which leaks from tumors into the bloodstream. Previous research conducted by Galleri founding company Grail showed that the test was effective at finding cancers that are difficult to identify early on, like head and neck, bowel, lung, pancreatic, and throat cancers. As of this writing, Galleri is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but was granted a breakthrough device designation in 2019 under a government-ledvoluntary program for certain medical devices \u201cthat provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.\u201d The test joins two other similar tumor-testing tests that were approved in the U.S., according to the consumer publication Evaluate. Galleri is available in the U.S. for $949, and is available for prescription only. Because it is new to the market and does not have FDA approval, the test is not covered by health insurance. Galleri doesn\u2019t rule out cancer, but instead helps providers to evaluate and confirm whether and where cancer may exist. It is intended to be used in coordination with other screening practices and is not a replacement but rather a method to inform the next steps of diagnosis. For the British trial, tens of thousands of recruitments between the ages of 50 and 77 \u2014 those most at risk for cancer \u2014 will be asked to give blood samples at mobile testing clinics across the country. Regardless of their results, the test is designed to detect cancer signals such as cfDNA and predict where in the body those signals exist. Half of the participants in the randomized control trial will have blood samples screened with the test right away, while the other half will have their sample stored and tested in the future. This will allow researchers to compare the stage at which cancer is detected between the two groups. Regardless, study participants will be notified if their test signals potential cancer. Early cancer detection during stage one or two allows for more treatment options, some of which can be less aggressive and harmful. Patients whose cancer is identified at the earliest stage may see up to ten times the survival rate compared to a person who learned of cancer at stage four. Those who give blood as part of the British trial will be invited to participate in later stages of the trial one and two years later. Initial results are expected by 2021 and if successful, researchers plan to extend the rollout to 1 million people by 2025.

Gaylord Williams from the small city of Kirksville in Missouri is suing his parents, Dave and Carol Williams, for \"deliberately making his life miserable\" by giving him \"an outdated and prejudicial first name\". In his allocution presented this morning in front of the Adair County Circuit Court, the teenage boy claims he was an undesired child and that his parents deliberately gave him that first name to make him \"a designated scapegoat\". \"They told me several times that I was an accident and that I had ruined their life. When he was drunk, my father even admitted that they had named me like that in order to ruin my life like I had ruined theirs.\" The story was accompanied by a picture that actually shows Se\u00e1n Cooke, an Irish teenager who sued his former soccer club and lost the court case. Interestingly enough the copied version of the story got over 50,000 likes/shares/comments on Facebook so far while the original is struggling to break a few thousands.

        "claim": "In 2004, as director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer told police not to prosecute \"Muslim rape gangs\" to prevent Islamophobia.",
        "doc": "Two Facebook posts claim the leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, told police when he was working for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) not to pursue cases against Muslim men accused of rape due to fears it would stir up anti-Islamic sentiment. The posts originally appeared in April and May 2020, but have recently seen a resurgence online with hundreds of new shares. They say: \"From 2004 onwards the director of public prosecutions told the police not to prosecute Muslim rape gangs to prevent 'Islamophobia'. \"That director was Keir Starmer, now the leader of the Labour party, who just promoted Naz Shah to his front bench, the Pakistani Muslim who thinks English children should keep quiet about being raped for the sake of 'diversity'.\" We presume the posts meant to say that the director of public prosecutions \"told\" the CPS, rather than the police, who do not prosecute cases. The police investigate and pass their evidence on to the CPS which then decides whether to prosecute. Even so, we cannot find any evidence to support the claim about Mr Starmer blocking the prosecution of Muslims. The claim about the promotion of Ms Shah is also misleading. It appears to refer to Ms Shah retweeting a post from a parody account. She apologised and rapidly deleted the retweet, which she said was an accident. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What went wrong with 'grooming gang' cases? Concerns about the abuse of underage girls by members of minority communities in towns in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and some Midlands counties first surfaced in 2002 , when they were raised by the then-Labour MP for Keighley, Ann Cryer. Subsequent reports and investigations confirmed that some people believed \"a fear of being labelled 'racist' had hindered the ability of official agencies to combat the grooming and sexual exploitation\". However, Mr Starmer did not become director of public prosecutions and head of the CPS until 1 November 2008 , four years later than the Facebook posts suggest, and we can find no evidence that he intervened in prosecutions against Muslim men accused of rape, or gave instructions that they should not be pursued, with the aim of reducing anti-Islamic sentiment. What happened while Mr Starmer was in charge? A number of prosecutions involving grooming gangs were taking place around the time Mr Starmer took up his new post. In the first of a series of articles exposing the grooming gangs scandal, published in January 2011, The Times identified 17 grooming gang prosecutions dating back to 1997. Of the 17 cases, 14 had taken place since 2008, the year Mr Starmer became the director of public prosecutions. \"In total, 56 people, with an average age of 28, were found guilty of crimes including rape, child abduction, indecent assault and sex with a child. Three of the 56 were white, 53 were Asian. Of those 50 were Muslim and a majority were members of the British Pakistani community,\" the newspaper reported. The Rochdale case Mr Starmer was the head of the CPS in 2009, when a key decision not to prosecute a case in Rochdale was taken . However, we can find no evidence he had any personal involvement in the decision, or that it was due to concern about Islamophobia. According to evidence given to the Home Affairs Committee , the decision was based on CPS guidelines of the time which suggested a jury might see victims as unreliable if they had come forward some time after the offence, if they had deviated or changed their accounts, made use of drink or drugs or had subsequently gone back to the perpetrator. As a result, such cases were thought not to have a realistic prospect of achieving a conviction. In 2011, Nazir Afzal , who at the time was director of prosecutions in London, was made chief prosecutor for the north west. He subsequently overturned the 2009 decision and a total of nine men were later convicted. In a recent interview Mr Afzal recalled: \"The only way we could bring that case was to admit that we had failed these victims when they had first made a complaint in 2008. Keir was 100% behind the decision to publicly admit that we had got it wrong in the past.\" Following these convictions, Mr Starmer appointed Mr Afzal as the head of a newly formed national network of specialist prosecutors for child abuse and sexual exploitation. Mr Afzal went on to oversee numerous convictions against other grooming gangs. In 2012, Mr Starmer said that while race had been a consideration, the failure of the CPS to prosecute such cases was down to the guidelines in place. He told The Times : \"In a number of cases presented to us, particularly in cases involving groups, there's clearly an issue of ethnicity that has to be understood and addressed. As prosecutors we shouldn't shy away from that. But if we're honest, it's the approach to the victims, the credibility issue, that caused these cases not to be prosecuted in the past. There was a lack of understanding.\" An independent report into child sexual abuse in Rotherham, published in 2014, noted that prior to leaving the CPS, Mr Starmer had established a new set of guidelines around the prosecution of child sexual exploitation to prevent earlier mistakes from being repeated. Naz Shah The post also says that, as Labour leader, Mr Starmer appointed to his front bench an MP who opposed the victims of grooming speaking out. In August 2017, Naz Shah, who represents Bradford West, shared and liked a post tweeted out from a parody Twitter account. It said: \"Those abused girls in Rotherham and elsewhere just need to shut their mouths. For the good of diversity.\" At the time, a spokesperson for Ms Shah said that retweeting and liking the post \"was a genuine accident\" that was \"rectified within minutes\", adding: \"[Naz] has and will continue to advocate for all victims, and work towards eradicating this evil from society.\" In April 2020, shortly after Keir Starmer became leader of the Labour Party, Ms Shah was appointed Shadow Minister for Community Cohesion. Whether this means she was \"promoted\" is a matter of opinion though, as she was already a member of Labour's front bench, having been appointed shadow equalities minister in 2018. She is now a shadow minister for the Home Office. Full Fact has approached Mr Starmer for comment. Image courtesy of UK Parliament",

        "claim": "Says Lee Leffingwell \"raised property taxes 20 percent in three years.\"",
        "doc": "Brigid Shea, running for mayor of Austin against incumbent Lee Leffingwell and activist Clay Dafoe, sent a mailer we spotted May 7, 2012, including a double-digit claim about hizzoner and taxes.\"Lee raised property taxes 20 percent in three years,\" the mailer says.All that much, and by his lonesome?Fortuitously, we had in hand a chart provided by the Travis Central Appraisal District showing the tax rate set by the Austin City Council each year from 1990-91 through 2011-12.Before Leffingwell was elected mayor, the council set a rate of 40.12 cents per $100 of appraised value for 2008-09, meaning the fiscal year through September 2009. Last year, the Leffingwell-led council set a rate of 48.11 cents for 2011-12. Put another way, the liability on a property valued at $100,000 before Leffingwell became mayor was $401.20. The liability in 2011-12 was $481.10.On its face, that\u2019s a 20 percent increase over three years -- as referenced on the flip side of Shea's mailer, which says: \"Lee voted to raise your property tax rate 20 percent in three years.\"But no mayor can set a tax rate on his or her own, which Shea knows because she\u2019s a former council member. Each year, the seven-member council votes on the rate as it completes the city\u2019s budget. In Austin\u2019s form of government, the mayor has one vote, like fellow council members. Asked by email about Shea\u2019s claim, the mayor\u2019s campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said: \"Lee did not raise these taxes \u2014 the Austin City Council raised these taxes.\"Another wrinkle: Leffingwell, a retired airline pilot, was on the council before he ran for mayor and had a vote on city tax rates set for every budget starting in 2005-06. Through his council tenure, the tax rate has dipped and gone up, according to the appraisal district\u2019s breakdown. In Leffingwell\u2019s first year on the council, members kept the previous year\u2019s rate of 44.30 cents per $100 in appraised value. Members cut the rate each of the next three years before raising it each of the next three years.Ed Van Eenoo, the city\u2019s budget officer, told us the council voted 7-0 for the three tax-rate changes \u2014 all increases \u2014 with Leffingwell as mayor.However, tax-rate changes alone don\u2019t reveal the pocketbook impact of city property taxes.Notably, for instance, Leffingwell said recently that Austin has the lowest tax rate by far of the five biggest Texas cities. That\u2019s so, but we rated his claim Half True after pointing out that any touting of tax rates is incomplete if it fails to fold in how much property-owners actually pay out.That\u2019s because property valuations and tax exemptions also influence what property owners pay. To gauge the property taxes owed the city, for instance, take your house\u2019s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate \u2014 with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than \"48.11 cents.\"Van Eenoo put it this way in an email reply to our inquiries about changes in the rates on the mayor\u2019s watch: \"Simply looking at tax rates does not provide a complete analysis as tax rates are heavily influenced by home values. When property values go up, the revenue needed to maintain operations can generally be achieved at a lower tax rate. Vice versa when values go down as they did in 2010 and 2011.\"One way to evaluate property tax rates without ignoring the role of home values, Van Eenoo said, is to compare the tax rate adopted by the council with what\u2019s known as the \"rollback rate.\" That\u2019s the maximum rate the city is allowed to set under state law without triggering a voter referendum. The rollback rate, Van Eenoo told us, is calculated as the rate that would bring in 8 percent more in revenue for operations and maintenance than in the previous year, plus enough money to pay the coming year\u2019s debt service.In keeping with the time period behind Shea\u2019s claim, let\u2019s focus on Leffingwell\u2019s mayoral years.In his first year leading the council, the tax rate set by the council was the rollback rate, as it had been for the previous three years. In the latter two years of Leffingwell\u2019s mayorship, the adopted tax rates were lower than the rollback rate, Van Eenoo said. In those years, then, the council didn\u2019t raise taxes as much as it could have.Yet another measure that takes into account changes in property values is the \"effective tax rate.\" That\u2019s the rate that the city would have to set to bring in roughly the same amount of revenue it received the year before on properties taxed in both years. In each year of Leffingwell\u2019s mayoral term, according to city data, the council\u2019s adopted tax rate exceeded the effective rate; on average, the rate was nearly 4 percent higher.Looking beyond rates, we wondered how much typical homeowners\u2019 city property tax bills had changed in the years Leffingwell has been mayor -- though we should note, of course, that the city is only one of the entities taxing Austin properties. Others include school districts, county government and community colleges.To support her statement that Leffingwell \"raised property taxes 20 percent in three years,\" Shea sent us data that she said showed tax bills for Austin homeowners had increased more than that amount since Leffingwell became mayor.Shea\u2019s analysis, which does not take into account exemptions, calculates annual tax bills using two different measures for home values: the median and average prices of homes sold in February of each year. Shea obtained the sales price information from the Texas A&M University Real Estate Center, which gathers data from real estate professionals across the state.Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a \"middle\" value \u2014 median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half the city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.For this reason, we put aside Shea\u2019s data on average sale price and stuck with her figures for the median. Those show that the city tax bill for a home valued at the February median sales price increased about 23 percent from 2008-09 ($753) to 2011-12 ($924).Still, Shea\u2019s data relies on the prices of homes sold in a single month each year. That\u2019s a small pool. We wondered whether there was a better representation of a typical Austin homeowner\u2019s property value.We found one in data from the city: annual \"median taxable value.\" Samantha Park, a city spokeswoman, told us that the \"taxable value\" of a home is the amount on which the city can actually tax. It\u2019s based on the appraised value, determined by the county\u2019s assessment, minus exemptions. The \"median taxable value,\" then, is the value at which half the city's homes were valued at more and half were valued at less.Next, we used the city\u2019s data to calculate how much the city taxes on a home with the median taxable value had changed during Leffingwell\u2019s mayoral term. Our calculations found an increase of about 25 percent from 2008-09 ($700) to 2011-12 ($877). That\u2019s greater than the 20 percent Shea cited on her mailer.Another factor to consider: inflation.Adjusting Shea\u2019s tax bill figures for inflation reduces the size of the increase during Leffingwell\u2019s mayorship to about 18 percent. Doing the same to the figures in our analysis of city data reduces the property tax increase to about 20 percent.We ran our work by the city. Park told us that our calculations of the city-provided data were fine, but that she had a quibble with our use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index to account for inflation in property tax increases.The CPI, Park said, \"takes into account the change in price for goods and services purchased by households, not government services that are provided,\" which is what taxpayers are funding through their property tax bills. And she suggested that rising prices may be hitting governments harder than consumers. To illustrate her point, she noted that the price of a gallon of milk rises more slowly than the price of health care services for city employees.Also, she said, our analysis does not consider the cost of \"improvements in service delivery.\" As an example, she pointed to the City Council\u2019s decision to turn the the city\u2019s animal shelter into a \"no-kill facility.\" We take this as saying the city chose to do more things \u2014 and those had costs.In response to the city\u2019s concern about the CPI, we used a different index \u2014 one from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis that gauges inflation for state and local governments \u2014 to adjust the tax bill figures in Shea\u2019s and our data. That reduces the increases by only half a percentage point compared to our calculations using the CPI.Our rulingMindful that tax rates alone paint an incomplete picture of the impact of property taxes, which are also driven by changes in property values, we found that what a typical Austin homeowner \u2014 one with the median-value home \u2014 paid in taxes went up 25 percent in the three years that Leffingwell\u2019s served as Austin mayor. Adjusted for inflation, that figure drops somewhat, but is still about 20 percent.So, taxes went up 20 percent, or more, with Leffingwell as mayor.However, no Austin mayor can raise taxes solo commando. Leffingwell had one of the seven votes that were cast each year in setting the city\u2019s rates. This significant perspective is absent from Shea\u2019s statement, making her claim Half True.",

        "doc": "The budget statement was correct about Kenya's revenue growth over the past eight years, as well as increased earnings from the tourism sector and the number of schools built by the administration. Despite also getting the growth in green energy sources and the number of title deeds issued by the government since 2013 mostly right, the minister was way off the mark with the majority of his claims. Yatani's claims about economic growth, inflation declines, a better police officer to citizen ratio, and the extent to which power generation has increased were all incorrect. Kenya's finance minister recently outlined the country's spending plans in what was the final budget statement of president Uhuru Kenyatta 's administration. Ukur Yatani made several claims in his speech, many of which resembled a scorecard of Kenyatta's tenure. The president will step down after the August 2022 elections, having been in office since 2013. Yatani's speech covered several areas, from the economy and jobs to policing, health and education. We checked the numbers. We contacted the national treasury's spokesperson for the evidence for the minister's claims. We will update this report once we receive his response. Yatani said the Kenyan economy had \"staged a strong recovery in 2021\", having weathered the shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when it contracted by 0.3%. He gave the estimated growth for 2021 as 7.6%. But the national statistics office is yet to publish data for the year. Vincent Kimosop is the founder of Sovereign Insight, a strategy and policy thinktank in Nairobi. He has also worked with the Kenyan government . To evaluate this claim, he referred us to the quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) reports published by the statistics office. The most recent report showed an average growth rate of 7.9% from January to September 2021. The treasury also published a similar figure in February 2022 . Kimosop attributed the growth to the momentum generated by the lifting of lockdown restrictions. \"It is basically increased production that is attributed to increased engagement and activity in the economy. When you look at it from that perspective you will understand why that level of growth was recorded,\" Kimosop said. As Yatani also said, the growth is a result of recovery. But in the absence of publicly available data on growth in the last quarter of 2021 or clarification from his office, we rate his claim unproven. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Gross domestic product (GDP) is a widely used measure of a country's economy. It is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period, usually a year. Official data shows Kenya's economy was valued at KSh4.7 trillion in 2013. The minister's figure of KSh5.3 trillion was only attained a year later. In February 2022, the national treasury provisionally estimated 2022 GDP as KSh12.6 trillion. After his budget speech , Yatani tabled a summary showing the same figure. None of his GDP figures for either 2013 or 2022 are supported by publicly available information. In March 2022 we fact-checked a claim by Kenyatta that the economy more than doubled during his administration. We found this to be misleading . Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. Photo: AFP/TONY KARUMBA Yatani's claim of a 155% increase in the economy's size, which he described as a \"monumental milestone\", also leaves out key context. During Kenyatta's administration the GDP was rebased twice, in 2014 and in 2021 . Yatani also omitted the increase in the country's public debt which analysts say has driven the bulk of economic activity as measured by GDP. GDP 'not a measure of societal progress' But there are also challenges with using GDP to show gains, Margarida Domingues de Carvalho, who works with Eurostat , the statistical office of the European Union , told Africa Check. \"GDP is often misinterpreted as a measure of societal progress and well-being, which it is not,\" she said in an email. \"GDP and GDP growth only give indications on the size and dynamics of an economy, but say nothing about, for example, the distribution of income and wealth or possible adverse environmental effects of the economic activity.\" Yatani gets the growth figures for 2013 and 2022 wrong, leaves out important context, and inaccurately uses GDP to signal progress. \u2013 Makinia Juma The country's statistics bureau publishes data on the number of jobs created in its annual economic survey. We checked the surveys released in 2018 and 2020 . New jobs created from 2013 to 2019 Economic survey 2018 Economic survey 2020 2013 755,800 2014 802,200 2015 844,500 847,300 2016 832,000 807,100 2017 897,800 905,900 2018 824,900 2019 846,300 As seen in the table, there are discrepancies in the numbers. But the total falls between 5.79 and 5.8 million jobs created between 2013 and 2019. The most recent survey was published in 2021. It showed that as of June 2020, the number of jobs shed due to the pandemic was 737,500. Cumulatively, that would reduce the jobs created in the period to 5 million. There were also reports of more job losses in 2021. But without data for this year, we cannot fully evaluate the minister's claim . \u2013 Grace Gichuhi Inflation measures \"how much more expensive a set of goods and services has become over a certain period of time, usually a year\", according to the International Monetary Fund . We looked at economic survey data to track inflation. Average annual inflation rates from 2013 to 2021 Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Inflation (%) 9.4 5.7 6.9 6.6 6.3 8 8 5.3 5.4 6.1 Sources: Economic surveys 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , 2019 , 2020 , 2021 and the quarterly economic and budget review report of February 2022. The average annual inflation rate was 5.7% in 2013 , not 7.2% as the minister claimed . In 2021, a treasury report showed inflation was 6.1% . Inflation did not decline, in fact it rose from 5.7% in 2013 to 8% in 2018. The most recent data shows that it was 6.1% in 2021, higher than it was in 2013. \u2013 Tess Wandia Kenya's central bank defines remittances as \"money sent by a person in a foreign land to his or her home country\". The bank records remittances using the US currency. For 2013, remittances were valued at US$1.29 billion . For 2021 they were $3.72 billion. The change between the two figures is 188%. However, in Kenyan currency, and using the average exchange rates for the two years , the increase worked out to 279%, which is not very far from the minister's 300%. But there are two important caveats. First, the Kenyan shilling has sharply depreciated against the US dollar in that period. Second, the central bank has data up to February 2022, not the whole year as per the minister's statement . \u2013 Dancan Bwire Ordinary revenue includes all taxes collected by the country's tax authority plus the appropriation-in-aid. Appropriation-in-aid refers to \"revenue in the form of receipts from user charges, collected by ministries or departments that is over and above the required amount and is spent by the entity that raised the revenue\". National treasury data showed the total ordinary revenue was KSh875.5 billion in 2012/13. During his budget speech Yatani tabled a document showing the actual revenue for the 2020/21 financial year was KSh1.8 trillion. In the previous three financial years, revenue rose from KSh1.5 trillion to KSh1.8 trillion. The tax authority has attributed the increased revenue to using technology, public awareness and an expansion of the tax base. We therefore rate Yatani's claim as correct. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenya's national statistics office does not release data on poverty annually, analysts have told Africa Check. The most recent official statistics , released in 2018, had data for 2015/16. This defines \"overall poverty\" as households and individuals whose monthly expenditure \"is less than KSh3,252 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh5,995 in core-urban areas\". It gives the national poverty headcount rate as 36.1%, a fall from the 2005/06 rate of 46.6% Therefore, in 2013, the available data had the poverty rate at 46.6%. In 2019, the data showed it was 36.1%. In 2021, the Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis , a government thinktank, said more Kenyans had fallen into poverty as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The thinktank estimated the 2019 poverty rate at 28.9% and the 2020 rate at 41.9%. None of these estimates support the minister's claim . \u2013 Tess Wandia The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. Before 2013, data on the number of all police officers in Kenya was not publicly available. The economic survey only published the numbers for the Kenya police service, but left out the administration police service. However, in 2013 when Kenyatta took office there were 75,325 police officers in Kenya, according to the national police service . That year Kenya's population was 41.8 million, official data shows . This made for a police-to-population ratio of one officer for every 555 people. The most recent economic survey put the number of police officers at 100,481 in 2020, while the estimated population was 48.7 million , for a police-to-population ratio of 1:485. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. \u2013 Tess Wandia Kenya's statistics agency publishes figures on the country's power generation. The data comes from the electricity utility Kenya Power and the power-generating company KenGen . In 2013, the country had 1,717 megawatts (MW ) in installed capacity according to the economic surveys for 2014 and 2015. Installed capacity refers to the maximum capacity that the electricity system is designed to run at. Kenya Power put the figure at 1,765 MW as of 30 June 2013. The closest to Yatani's figure of 1,300 MW was in 2009 when it was at 1,311 MW . According to the most recent economic survey , the country's installed capacity was 2,836.7 MW in 2020. Kenya Power's most recent annual report showed that Kenya had 2,984 MW in installed capacity as at 30 June 2021, a figure also cited by the energy regulator, the Energy Petroleum Regulatory Authority . We therefore rate this claim as incorrect . \u2013 Makinia Juma Yatani said green sources currently account for 73% of Kenya's installed power generation capacity. These sources include geothermal, wind, solar and hydro power. The most recent data from the country's state-owned utility, Kenya Power, showed a total installed capacity of 2,984 MW in 2021 broken down as follows: Green energy sources in Kenya (2021) in MW Source Hydro Geothermal Wind Solar Total from green sources Total installed capacity % of green sources 2021 838.4 863 436.1 90.3 2,227.8 2,984 74.7% We rate this claim as mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma According to the lands ministry , the government issued 5.1 million title deeds from 2013 to 2021. From 2013 to April 2020, 4.4 million titles were issued . At least 1.26 million deeds were given out from 2018 to April 2020. Africa Check previously asked the lands minister for data on title deeds issued since April 2020 but has not yet received a response. Only the ministry can confirm the number of deeds it has issued, the Kenya Land Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation that advocates for land reform in the country, told Africa Check. Yatani's claim that the current administration has issued 5.3 million title deeds over the last eight years is mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma Data from the national statistics office showed that in 2013, Kenya earned KSh94 billion from tourism. The most recent data showed that earnings were KSh163.6 billion in 2019. The increase is 74%. Tourism receipts dropped to KSh91.7 billion in 2020 due to rules that restricted travel because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Kenyan tourism earnings from 2013 to 2019 Year Amount, billions 2013 93.97 2014 87.08 2015 84.60 2016 99.69 2017 119.90 2018 157.38 2019 163.55 Yatani's claim is correct. \u2013 Grace Gichuhi According to the economic survey 2021 , hospital bed numbers increased from 64,844 in 2016 to 82,091 in 2020, a 9.6% increase. The statistics bureau said its data was from the Kenya Master Health Facility List , an application with all health facilities and community units in the country, compiled by the health ministry . Hospital beds in Kenya 2016 to 2020 Year Hospital beds Increase 2016 64,844 - 2017 67,195 2,351 2018 71,601 4,406 2019 74,868 3,267 2020 82,091 7,223 Source: Kenya National Bureau of Statistics We were however unable to find data from 2013 to 2015, making it difficult to verify the claim. We have contacted the health ministry and will update this report with their response. Until then, we rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Dancan Bwire Data from the education ministry shows Kenya had 26,549 primary schools in 2012. The number increased to 32,437 in 2020, according to the national statistics office. The data also shows secondary schools increased from 7,174 in 2012 to 10,413 schools in 2020. Based on the available data, the claim is correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma In education, the term transition refers to the progression of students between different stages in the school system. It can be between grades within a given level, from one level to the next, and out of and back into schools. In Kenya, the transition rate refers to the movement from pre-school into primary, from primary to secondary education, and from secondary to tertiary institutions. Yatani's speech focused on the primary into secondary transition rate, where candidates who sat their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam subsequently joined secondary school. The 2016 economic survey puts the 2012 transition rate at 64.5%. The most recent data from the agency gave the transition rate for 2020 as 91%, a rise of 5.5 percentage points from 85.5% in 2019. The ministry's data confirms the transition rate in 2012 was at 64.5% but there isn't publicly available evidence yet to prove it's at 100% in 2022, as Yatani claimed. \u2013 Makinia Juma John Kinuthia is a senior programme officer with the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership , a global budget transparency organisation. He told Africa Check that per capita income is measured by looking at the average income per person in a country. \"So we look at total earnings then divide that by the total population. This is often used to gauge the standard of living in a country.\" Kinuthia directed us to gross national income per capita figures as published by Kenya's statistics office in its annual statistical abstract. The most recent abstract put the per capita gross national income at KSh125,845 for 2013, and gives a provisional figure of KSh217,200 in 2020. The data agency has not released figures for 2021. We can therefore only rate this claim as unproven. Kinuthia said there were varying opinions as to the usefulness of such measures in countries with large inequalities like Kenya. \"Those who make the most are very few,\" he said. This risked skewing the data. \u2013 Makinia Juma",

        "claim": "The sales tax increase, if approved, will cost taxpayers \"up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa.\"",
        "doc": "On Nov. 2, voters will be asked to decide a number of ballot questions. One of the most important ones asks Hillsborough County voters if they support raising the sales tax by a penny to pay for a new commuter rail system, expanded bus service and road building. If the primary election was any indication, the transit tax question will color the debate in other political contests. One recurring assertion from tax opponents was that the proposed increase will cost taxpayers $300 million a year. It was often infused with the suggestion that all of that money will go toward rail and benefit only Tampa. We decided to test one such statement. It came in the context of Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe\u2019s successfulre-election bid. Sharpe has been a leading advocate of the referendum. He had faceda challenge in the Republican primary from former county party leader Josh Burgin, who opposed the tax. Sam Rashid, a conservative activist and transit tax opponent, put out a mid-summer mailer that claimed Sharpe, a previously avowed opponent of new taxes, was seeking to \"impose\" a huge one. \"Up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa,\" Rashid wrote. Burgin used the $300 million figure repeatedly in his own campaign material. We decided to look at whether $300 million, and the way Rashid couched its use, was accurate. We started with the number itself, asking Rashid where he got it. He told PolitiFact Florida that it was based on his recollection of what existing Hillsborough County sales taxes have produced at their peak, and that he simply tacked on a bit more to account for anticipated growth and inflation. The county has two sales taxes it assesses, both a half-cent charged on goods and some services. One pays for health care for the poor. The other funds such things as roads, jails and the construction of Raymond James Stadium. County records show that revenues from the two sales taxes peaked in 2006 at $107.1 million each. Double that figure to get what a full penny tax would have raised: $214.2 million \u2013 quite a bit shy of $300 million. Since then, sales tax revenues have dropped off considerably. Through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the tax was projected to bring in $64.8 million, making Rashid\u2019s figure look like an even greater exaggeration. Rashid gives himself some cover by using the qualifier \"up to.\" He says he was trying to project what the tax will cost annually over its lifetime, and his word choice in the mailer gives that sense. So we asked Kevin Brickey, the economist for Hillsborough County government, when sales tax receipts might reasonably be expected to reach $300 million. Brickey noted such predictions can be debated during stable economic times. The current recession makes it more of a dicey proposition. But Brickey prepared just such an analysis for the county\u2019s transit agency, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, in July. HART would oversee the rail and bus system if the referendum is approved. His analysis was based on a conservative annual growth rate assumption of 4 percent. It estimated that sales tax revenues from a full penny tax will not reach $300 million until fiscal year 2022 \u2013 more than a decade after the tax goes into effect. Brickey performed a second analysis for PolitiFact using a 6 percent growth rate, still considered conservative, but one forecasters might typically use under normal circumstances. It shows the $300 million threshold getting crossed in fiscal year 2019. Due to compounding, Brickey predicts that even under a growth scenario of approximately 4 percent, the sales tax would approach $600 million by its 30th year. So under reasonably conservative projections, Rashid\u2019s number is certainly in the ballpark, and arguably understates the long-term cost to taxpayers. But there are problems with Rashid\u2019s assertion because he contends that all the money will go toward rail in Tampa. For one, 25 percent of sales tax revenues would be obligated toward road work. That means that by the second year of the tax, when Brickey estimates it should bring in nearly $200 million, $50 million will go toward road projects that have nothing to do with rail. They are spread throughout the county and are concentrated outside of Tampa by design, particularly in early years. Figuring out how much of the rest will go toward rail, as opposed to buses, presents a greater challenge. Estimates vary from year to year as construction of the rail system progresses and trains start rolling. HART has prepared an analysis of where all the money will go over the next 30 years. But it combines sales tax revenues and money local officials hope to get from the state and federal government in matching dollars, plus property tax revenues, in one pot. Based on those numbers, HART expects to spend about 52 percent of all of its future revenue on rail. Working with Brickey and HART, the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization has prepared a detailed analysis of how the sales tax would be spent through 2035. It shows that, of the 75 percent of the penny tax that would be spent on transit, 57 percent would go toward rail. That represents 43 percent of all projected sales tax expenditures. Even adding in a significant \"oops\" factor, about half the money would go toward rail. The rest would go toward buses, roads and trails, much if not most of it outside Tampa city limits. These numbers are subject to change. HART is still doing an analysis to determine if rail makes sense along the corridors identified for it. And they\u2019re still determining what specific paths the rail lines would take, which they won\u2019t finish until after the election. That all affects the bottom line. Finally, while it is true that the first two legs of the train system would be within Tampa city limits, there are plans for later expansion outside the city, including a line to Brandon. If Rashid had confined his statement to asserting that the proposed hike would cost taxpayers $300 million a year, we probably would have rated that Mostly True, since it will be soon enough. But he said that it was all going for trains in the city of Tampa. It is true that this whole exercise was largely initiated by Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio, who made building a commuter rail system a top goal. But the discussion ended up in the hands of the County Commission, which ultimately put the question on the ballot. After months of study initiated by Commission Chairman Ken Hagan, a task force recommended that a significant portion of the money go to roads and buses. And that\u2019s the position the County Commission took in crafting the ballot language. So while critics want to label the initiative a rail tax for the city of Tampa that will not benefit suburban residents, PolitiFact finds Rashid\u2019s attempt to frame the issue as Barely True.",

Rakesh Tikait is the leader and spokesman of the umbrella alliance of more than 20 farmers\u2019 groups leading the ongoing protest against new agricultural laws. The video was shared online following clashes between police and protesting farmers in the Indian capital Delhi on January 26, 2021. AFP reported on the clashes here. At the video's 10-second mark, a senior police officer can be heard asking the policemen to chant \"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan\" (\"Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer\"). This slogan was coined by former Indian prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri to praise the contribution of soldiers and farmers in nation building, as reported here by the BBC. At the clip's 22-second mark, a male voice can be heard saying in Hindi that the policemen are scared. The video was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here; and on Twitter here, here and here. The video, however, has been shared in a misleading context. A reverse image search on Google found a longer version of the footage published by Bombay-based English-language daily newspaper Times of India in an article on January 27, 2021. It reports that Delhi Police officers chanted a slogan in a bid \u201cto urge farmers to get back on the designated route\u201d. The report features a 46-second video. \u201cRequest them politely otherwise they [protesters] will run over us,\u201d a senior police official can be heard saying to other police officers between the 15 and 22 second mark of the clip. Indian state-run broadcaster Prasar Bharti also tweeted the video alongside a similar description. The tweet similarly states the clip shows the the Joint Commissioner of Delhi Police urging his colleagues to keep the protesters calm. Joint Commissioner asked Delhi Police to remain calm and peaceful while trying to ease the situation on Republic Day, chanted 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.'Video- @SriSubodhKmr pic.twitter.com/y7B5SPVD8a \u201cJoint Commissioner asked Delhi Police to remain calm and peaceful while trying to ease the situation on Republic Day, chanted 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan,\u201d the tweet reads. Thousands of farmers congregated in Delhi on January 26, 2021 driving tractors from border camps where they have been holding sit-ins since November, AFP reported. The rally turned violent, leaving one person dead and hundreds of police injured. Prime Minister Narendra Modi lambasted the assault and pledged to push on with new deregulation laws. The Indian government\u2019s Press Information Bureau (PIB) refuted the claim that 200 Delhi Police personnel resigned during the protest. \u201cThere has been a claim on social media that 200 Delhi Police personnel have tendered mass resignation. #PIBFactCheck: This is a fake claim,\u201d it tweeted on January 30, 2021. The Cyber Crime unit of the Delhi Police also said to have arrested a person for spreading \u201cfake news about resignation of police personnel\u201d and \u201cpropagating false rumours regarding disaffection in police ranks\u201d in a tweet on February 1, 2021.

        "doc": "Revelations came to light in fall 2019 that U.S. President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate current Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and his son. In response, the president\u2019s defenders have highlighted a May 4, 2018, letter signed by three Democratic senators to Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor general of Ukraine (a similar role to the U.S. attorney general), as evidence that claims of improper behavior are misplaced. The letter was notably described by Washington Post columnist Marc Theisen as betraying a \u201cdouble standard.\u201d This sentiment was amplified by several media outlets, as well as a viral tweet (retweeted by Donald Trump Jr.) from the Twitter account Comfortably Smug, which according to BuzzFeed News is run by a \u201cRepublican political consultant and deliberate spreader of false information\u201d: Several reasons exist why the above tweet and associated sentiment are incorrect and misleading. At the top of that list is the fact that the letter in question did not concern a request to \u201cinvestigate Trump,\u201d nor did it request the opening of any investigation. Instead, it requested information on why Ukrainian special prosecutor Serhiy Horbatyuk (who serves in a special prosecutor role charged with investigating corruption cases linked to former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich) had been \u201cprohibited\u201d from \u201cissuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses\u201d in four existing investigations into former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort. Manafort, prior to joining the Trump campaign, had worked as a political consultant for Yanukovich and his political party. The four investigations involved money that flowed either to Manafort for this consulting work or to a law firm working with Manafort and others to improve Yanukovich\u2019s image in the West. They did not involve Trump. The three Democratic senators \u2014 then-Foreign Affairs Committee members Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy \u2014 were responding to a May 2, 2018, New York Times report that the four Manafort investigations in Ukraine were specifically singled out from a docket of nearly 3,000 corruption cases in Horbatyuk\u2019s portfolio to be blocked from issuing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in his charge to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, was investigating Manafort in part because of concerns that he owed substantial funds to Russian oligarchs as a result of this consulting work, potentially giving them leverage over him as he ran Trump\u2019s campaign. The reason Ukrainian officials impeded the investigation was no secret, according to the Times \u2014 it was to placate the Trump administration, which opposed the Mueller probe: Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of [now former] President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort\u2019s activities \u201cin the long-term box.\u201d \u201cIn every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,\u201d Mr. Ariev said in an interview. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t spoil relations with the administration.\u201d These discussions came at a complicated time for Ukraine, a country that has been fighting Russian aggression and that had been in the process of securing arms from the United States. \u201cThe decision to halt the investigations by an anti-corruption prosecutor was handed down as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti-tank missiles, called Javelins,\u201d the Times reported. Far from requesting an \u201cinvestigation\u201d, the senators requested answers to three specific questions from a specific Ukrainian government official: Manafort broadly admitted to involvement in activities related to those four Ukrainian probes via a September 2018 guilty plea. Even ignoring the allegedly implied quid pro quo in the Trump-Zelensky call, a comparison between the senators\u2019 request for information from the chief Ukrainian law enforcement official and Trump\u2019s requests of Zelensky is problematic. As senators on the Committee on Foreign Relations, which not only provides oversight for arms dealsbut also general oversight of America\u2019s relationships with its allies, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy were acting within their constitutional rights and obligations as official representatives of the U.S. government with oversight responsibility over the executive branch. Conversely, in his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Trump explicitly requested that the Ukrainian president meet with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 an unelected private citizen without a security clearance or oversight from anyone but Trump \u2014 to initiate investigations into a disparate set of claims whose sole unifying feature is that they concern Trump\u2019s political rivals: the Democratic National Committee and the Biden family. Because the letter at issue did not actually demand an investigation into Trump or even compel initiation of any investigation, we rank the claim that Democrats asked Ukraine to \u201cinvestigate Trump\u201d in 2018 as false.",

        "doc": "The video of a man jumping in front of a truck is five years old. (Photo: India Today/Riddhish Dutta) A disturbing video has been making the rounds on social media. It shows a truck crushing a man under its wheels. In the video, it appears as if the man ran toward the truck and jumped in its path. Those sharing this video claimed this incident took place on the morning of July 20 in Deoband, Uttar Pradesh. They also claimed the man was Muslim and the truck was transporting Kanwariya pilgrims. Further, people claimed police had filed a case against the Kanwariya pilgrims, investigating if the man was killed intentionally. Archived versions of similar posts can be seen here and here. AFWA\u2019s investigation found the video is nearly five years old. Additionally, the police concluded that the man in the video died by suicide. AFWA Probe We reverse-searched grabs from the video and found the same video shared by a Facebook Page on July 18, 2017. This proved that the video was not recent. Subsequent searches led us to multiple news reports on the incident. These reports that were published in July 2017 said that the man killed in this accident was identified as Wahid, a resident of the Lahaswada village of Deoband. The incident took place on the Saharanpur-Muzaffarnagar state highway. Reportedly, a local captured the tragic incident on his phone. The video soon went viral. The reports also said that because it was clearly visible in the video that Wahid jumped in the truck\u2019s path, his family agreed to perform the last rites and not press charges. A Jagran report said that while the truck\u2019s driver and its Kanwariya passengers were taken to a nearby police station, they were released later after questioning. For more details, AFWA reached out to Prabhakar Shantaram, the SHO of the Deoband police station. \u201cIt became clear from the video that it was a suicide case. Therefore, we did not investigate this further. The family of the deceased also left with the body without making any complaints,\u201d Shantaram said. --- ENDS --- INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim On July 20, a Muslim man in UP's Deoband was crushed and killed by a truck carrying Kanwariya pilgrims. Police are investigating if the man was killed intentionally. Conclusion This video is from July 2017. The man in the video, Wahid, died by suicide.

Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code deals with cheating and fraud cases. It is common to refer to a fraudster in India as a \u2018420\u2019. The photo is being used to mock the Prime Minister. Twitter user Jayashankar Kenath, whose bio says he is the editor of The Indian News, shared this photo with the caption \u2018What an apt capture\u2019. His tweet received 900+ retweets and over 6,000 likes. Another user, Abiha Zaidi, also shared the photo on Twitter with a similar caption. Multiple users have shared this photo on Twitter in the last 24 hours. Though some of these posts have not received likes and retweets as the two mentioned above, they are quite a few in number. Fact Check We performed a Google reverse image search on the viral photo and came across multiple news articles about PM Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the Varanasi railway station around this time last year. The photos have been credited to the Twitter account of PM Modi. Upon digging into PM Modi\u2019s Twitter account, we found the original set of photos uploaded.

This further proves that the now-viral photo has been morphed. Hence it is clear that a morphed photo of PM Modi\u2019s visit to the Varanasi railway station last year has been shared on Twitter to mock the leader.

        "claim": "U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a political ally to U.S. President Donald Trump, ordered Postal Service carriers to \"slow the mail down\" to help Trump win the 2020 presidential election.",
        "doc": "As U.S. President Donald Trump accelerated unsubstantiated attacks on the legitimacy of mail-in voting during the summer of 2020, numerous Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether the leader of the U.S. Postal Service was carrying out a nefarious scheme to help Trump win another presidential term. In late July and early August, various rumors surfaced regarding Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman whom the Postal Service\u2019s governing board selected to run the agency in May 2020. For example, a viral tweet thread alleged: My mailman just confirmed they have all officially been told to \u201cSLOW THE MAIL DOWN,\u201d per trump\u2019s Postmaster General. \u2026He says that there is backed up mail ALL OVER THE FLOOR. He\u2019s never seen anything like it. It has ALREADY begun. But as long as we keep each other informed, we can beat their dirty tricks with INFORMATION. The claim\u2019s underlying notions were these: DeJoy was a political ally to the Republican president, and the new postmaster general had used his new authority to order Postal Service carriers and clerks to slow deliveries to help Trump win the 2020 November election. A backlog of ballots in the weeks or days before Election Day, critics of the president worried, could lead to votes going uncounted or deemed invalid due to state laws governing mail-in election deadlines. What follows is an examination of federal documents obtained by Snopes \u2014 including letters by members of Congress, campaign finance reports, and internal memos to Postal Service employees \u2014 as well as interviews with postal union representatives and a Postal Service spokesperson, to determine the legitimacy of those questions. DeJoy could not be reached for an interview for this report. Note: Snopes not only investigated DeJoy\u2019s relationship to Trump, but his financial stake in companies that compete with the Postal Service to evaluate if, or to what extent, his past investments provided any evidence of a plan to undermine the Postal Service\u2019s longstanding mission: to provide mail service to every American, no matter their address or income. Yes. DeJoy, who lives in Greensboro, donated more than $1.2 million to the Trump campaign between August 2016 and February 2020, according to campaign finance reports compiled by the Federal Elections Commission(FEC). It\u2019s unclear when or how DeJoy developed a relationship with Trump, and why he decided to support the billionaire\u2019s political pursuits. In a 2005 interview with Greensboro\u2019s local newspaper, DeJoy \u2014 then-CEO of New Breed Logistics, a distribution and warehousing company \u2014 appeared less supportive of Trump, saying his self-important attitude on the reality-TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was destructive. \u201cI\u2019d be fired,\u201d DeJoy said, if he was a contestant. Nonetheless, by early 2017, DeJoy was among his state\u2019s top donors to Trump (see below for The Charlotte Observer\u2019s list that ranks DeJoy at No. 3 with a total contribution of $111,000). And by October of that year, DeJoy had become close enough to the president to host him and other donors for fundraiser at his Greensboro house. Also, by that time, DeJoy\u2019s wife, Aldona Wos, had been appointed by the president to serve as vice chair of a White House commission that oversees paid fellowships in federal offices, according to the couple\u2019s foundation website. In addition to his contributions to Trump\u2019s political campaigns specifically, DeJoy has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican causes or campaigns over decades, the FEC records show. The Postal Service\u2019s governing board, a group appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate, selected DeJoy as Postmaster General on May 6, 2020, after what it described as an extensive nationwide search for qualified candidates. At the time of that decision, Trump had appointed all six board members \u2014 Chairman Robert Duncan, John Barger, Ron Bloom, Roman Martinez IV, Donald Moak, and William Zollars \u2014since the early days of his presidency. DeJoy, who was in charge of fundraising for the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Charlotte when the board made its announcement, made the following donations since the start of 2020, according to filings from the FEC: In sum, considering DeJoy\u2019s record of donations, as well as evidence of him hosting a Trump fundraiser at his Greensboro home in fall 2017, it is accurate to claim that the new postmaster general is a political ally to the Republican president. The answer to this question is less clear. In summer 2020, the viral claim about DeJoy \u2014 that he had directed carriers to delay mail to benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign (which we unpack below) \u2014 took on another layer: that DeJoy had also allegedly invested $70 million of his own money in delivery companies that compete with the Postal Service. That allegation, which we deemed mostly true (see the explanation below), was particularly worrisome for critics of Trump and DeJoy, who believed the alleged holdings were more proof of the two leaders conspiring together \u2014 this time in an attempt to privatize the Postal Service. Here\u2019s some context before we dive into DeJoy\u2019s personal assets: Conservative Republicans have long pushed to remove government from mail services that they believe should be left to the private commercial market. Since Trump took office, he has called the Postal Service \u201ca joke\u201d or Amazon\u2019s \u201cdelivery boy,\u201d considering its package rates, and has floated the idea of eventually privatizing the agency. Meanwhile, others fear dismantling the federally-mandated mail service would disproportionately affect people who live in rural areas, where private companies such as FedEx and UPS either charge higher rates or do no shipments at all. At the same time, the Postal Service \u2014 which does not receive tax dollars for its operating expenses \u2014 faces a worsening financial situation due to a 2006 congressional mandate that required the agency to prepay health care benefits of retirees, as well as a decline in first-class mail customers. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those long-standing problems, forcing several post offices nationwide to completely close or scale back hours. For instance, on April 9, 2020, roughly one month before DeJoy was selected to lead the Postal Service, then-Postmaster General Megan Brennan said the agency was preparing for a $13 billion revenue shortfall due \u201cdirectly to COVID-19\u201d and an additional $54.3 billion in losses over 10 years. Considering those projections, she said the agency could \u201crun out of cash this fiscal year\u201d \u2014 or the end of September \u2014 without federal intervention. (Brennan announced her retirement in October 2019, after more than 30 years with the agency.) The former Postal Service leader made those comments shortly after federal leaders negotiated a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which, initially, included a $13 billion one-time boost for the mail service. But, purportedly at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and aides to Trump, congressional leaders removed that provision from the stimulus package, and instead included a $10 billion loan that the Trump administration could leverage in its favor. Then, on July 29, 2020, The Washington Post reported that under DeJoy\u2019s leadership, the postal agency gave Mnuchin\u2019s office\u2019s proprietary information about the Postal Service\u2019s most lucrative private-sector contracts, such as Amazon, FedEx and UPS, in exchange for the loan money. By that time, Congressional leaders and Trump were battling yet again over another emergency relief package; Democrats proposed a $25 billion boost for the Postal Service but then lowered that amount to $10 billion during talks with Republicans. On Aug. 13, 2020, during an interview on Fox Business Network, the president said frankly the tug-and-pull over Postal Service funding was part of his administration\u2019s plan to try to make it harder for the agency to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots in the November election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they don\u2019t get the money,\u201d Trump told host Maria Bartiromo, referring to the false claim that Democrats are are proposing a universal mail-in voting system. \u201cThat means they can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting; they just can\u2019t have it.\u201d Which brings us to DeJoy\u2019s assets, and the above-mentioned claim that he had \u201c$70 million invested in companies that compete with USPS.\u201d For the basis of this analysis, we considered private companies that provide shipping or distribution services, such as DHL, the FedEx Corporation, and United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), business competitors with the post office. For more than 30 years, DeJoy was the CEO of New Breed Logistics, a supply chain business that contracted with a variety of public and private companies, including the Postal Service. In 2014, XPO Logistics acquired DeJoy\u2019s company, and he served on the company\u2019s executive team or board of directors until May 2018. According to internal documents, which we obtained using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) database of company filings, XPO Logistics considered its competitors to include DHL, FedEx, UPS,and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. Aside from that evidence, which proved DeJoy\u2019s former company competed for business with organizations that also competed with the Postal Service, Snopes uncovered a letter from his wife, Wos, to a White House legal advisor on January 3, 2020, that listed her family\u2019s financial assets, known as \u201cAttachment A.\u201d According to that list, the family had stock in companies including UPS, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc. She wrote the letter in response to a nomination by the Trump administration to serve as U.S. ambassador to Canada, and she said she would divest from all holdings in the document within 90 days of her confirmation. However, as of this writing, Wos had not been sworn into the position. The letter, which was available via the Office of Government Ethics, read: As of June 15, 2020, the day DeJoy assumed his role as postmaster general, The Washington Post reported the couple had between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in Postal Service competitors or contractors. XPO Logistics represented the vast majority of those investments, and the couple\u2019s combined stake in UPS and trucking company J.B. Hunt, for examples, was roughly $265,000. On DeJoy\u2019s first day, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, said in letter to the Postal Service\u2019s board of governors\u2019 chairman: \u201c[DeJoy\u2019s] financial interests in companies that have business ties with the Postal Services, as well as his extensive campaign fundraising efforts, raise questions\u201d over his ethical conflicts of interest and partisan interests. By that point, a spokeswoman for DeJoy told journalists he had resigned as finance chair for the Republican National Convention, and would \u201ccomply with any financial divestitures that are required\u201d for the new leadership position. In sum, reports proved the DeJoy family at one point had millions of dollars in assets in companies that compete or contract with the Postal Service, which lend credibility to the viral assertion. But the exact amount of such investments was unclear, and as of this writing, it was unknown if or to what extent the couple had divested any of the financial holdings. Not exactly \u2014 but there is some truth to the claim. Upon our analysis, the rumor seems to have stemmed from a series of directives DeJoy gave Postal Service employees since he took over the agency. On his first day, for example, he addressed the agency in a video that alluded to impending changes under his leadership that aimed to create a \u201cviable operating model,\u201d though he did not go into specifics. Then, in mid-July, he issued several memos to employees, including a \u201cNew [Postmaster General\u2019s] expectations and plan.\u201d Those messages to all managers, clerks, and carriers nationwide appeared to be the source of the claim, and detailed changes to how and when the Postal Agency would deliver mail. A July 10, 2020, internal document to managers, which Snopes received from the American Postal Workers Unionand refers to an \u201coperational pivot\u201d for the agency, said the following, for example: The initial step in our pivot is targeted on transportation and the soaring costs we incur due to late trips and extra trips, which costs the organization somewhere around $200 million in added expenses. The shifts are simple, but they will be challenging, as we seek to change our culture and move away from past practices previously used. But perhaps most relevant to the claim, the DeJoy-sponsored directives included instructions for employees to leave letters or packages at distribution centers if they delayed carriers from their routes \u2014 contradicting previous rules for deliveries \u2014 and said the Postal Service would no longer pay employees overtime to complete all mail deliveries. The July 10, 2020 memo said: One aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that \u2014 temporarily \u2014 we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks [in Processing and Distribution Centers], which is not typical. We will address root causes of these delays and adjust the very next day. Any mail left behind must be properly reported, and employees should ensure this action is taken with integrity and accuracy. As we adjust to the ongoing pivot, which will have a number of phases, we know that operations will begin to run more efficiently and that delayed mail volumes will soon shrink significantly. We also considered a separate message to employees in July 2020 that said, under a new initiative, carriers in certain regions would not sort any mail during the morning and instead clock in, retrieve sorted mail from the previous day and limit time in the office as much as possible. Then, when they returned from the streets, they would sort all available mail for the next day. The agency said the extra spending on employees\u2019 overtime or delivery trips had not improved \u201cour performance scores,\u201d without going into detail on what that meant, and framed the changes as necessary steps to improve its financial position. A July 27, 2020, public statement from DeJoy said: Given our current situation, it is critical that the Postal Service take a fresh look at our operations and make necessary adjustments. We are highly focused on our public service mission to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to every person and business in this country, and to remain a part of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. David Partenheimer, manager of media relations for the Postal Service, told Snopes that the postmaster general was not doing any media interviews regarding the initiatives, nor about the underlying claims of this report. In a roughly 760-word email to us, however, Partenheimer reemphasized what the agency viewed as the need for the adjustments, and said: \u201cWe acknowledge that temporary service impacts can occur as we redouble our efforts to conform to the current operating plans, but any such impacts will be monitored and temporary \u2026 and corrected as appropriate.\u201d Soon after the directives, American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein told us in a phone interview that employees and customers across the country were noticing mail delays. In the Philadelphia region, for instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported situations where residents were going upwards of three weeks without receiving packages and letters, and postal union leaders and carriers said mail was piling up at offices, unscanned and unsorted. \u201cWhen you \u2026 say this is what you have to do as workers, then that\u2019s what we have to do \u2014 [the change] runs counter to everything that the Postal Service is about, which is we treat the mail as our own; we get it to the customer as quickly as we can,\u201d Dimondstein said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never seen mail backed up like this \u2014 it\u2019s not being moved.\u201d That meant, while DeJoy had not told carriers to \u201cslow the mail down\u201d verbatim, he initiated changes to how and when carriers go about doing their job that the Postal Agency said would cause temporary mail delays. However, it would be inaccurate to assume all slow deliveries under DeJoy\u2019s leadership were a result of the July 2020 directives specifically, when they could also be linked to reduced hours for some post offices or other circumstances. Roughly three months before the 2020 presidential election, voting rights groups and outspoken critics to the president believed the new directives by DeJoy occurred at a convenient time for Trump: when a record number of Americans were preparing to vote by mail and avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 coronavirus by casting ballots at in-person polling places. Specifically, they worried the new requirements for post office carriers and clerks would lead to backlogs of mail-in ballots and thus create challenges for elections officials who, in the majority of states, must invalidate ballots that reach them after Election Day \u2014 even if they were postmarked before that date.Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, for example, led colleagues in writing a letter to DeJoy on July 20, 2020, that said: \u201cWhile these changes [to mail service] in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner \u2014 an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election.\u201d We asked Dimondstein, APWU president, whether he believed the July directives by Postal Service leadership were somehow linked to a plan to cause mail service chaos before the November election and help Trump win reelection. He said: What we do know for truth is this administration is, in written record, proposing and planning to sell the post office to private corporations, i.e. privatizing. \u2026That was June 2018. We also know as a fact that \u2026that [there are] calls for reduced service, increased prices, and less workers\u2019 rights and benefits. So if you take those two things together, certainly if they\u2019re implemented, then they\u2019re going to cause delays in mail; they\u2019re going to cause service being undermined. \u2026 This is a fact: [DeJoy is] what\u2019s considered a mega-donor of the Trump administration and the Republican party. \u2026 Anything that undermines the Postal Service\u2019 [service to customers] \u2026 has us concerned that it could be linked back to those who have an agenda to eliminate [the Postal Service]. But I can\u2019t sit here and tell you that that\u2019s a fact. Partenheimer said any notion that DeJoy made decisions for the Postal Service under directions from Trump (which include claims that he issued the July 2020 changes that resulted in delays to help Trump\u2019s re-election campaign) were \u201cwholly misplaced and off-base.\u201d He said the Postal Service, typically an apolitical agency, remains committed to \u201cfulfilling our role in the electoral process\u201d in places where politicians allow voters to cast ballots by mail and \u201cto delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.\u201d He elaborated: \u201c[Despite] any assertions to the contrary, we are not slowing down Election Mail or any other mail. Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with our standards.\u201d Days later, he said in a statement to news mediathat \u201ccertain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, may be incompatible with the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards,\u201d especially if election officials don\u2019t pay more for first-class postage. \u201cTo the extent that states choose to use the mail as part of their elections, they should do so in a manner that realistically reflects how the mail works,\u201d he said. Then, on Aug. 18, 2020, DeJoy issued a statement in which he said he would temporarily suspend initiatives \u201cthat have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic,\u201d including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips. The statement read: To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded. I want to assure all Americans of the following: In addition, effective Oct. 1, we will engage standby resources in all areas of our operations, including transportation, to satisfy any unforeseen demand. In sum, it was accurate to state that DeJoy, a political ally to Trump, ordered Postal Service workers to leave late-arriving mail at distribution centers for delivery the following day and eliminate extra trips in July 2020 \u2014 a change the Postal Service was expecting to cause temporary mail delays \u2014 although no verifiable evidence proved those directives were part of a deliberate scheme to disenfranchise voters in the November 2020 election. Additionally, there was no proof to show the changes aimed to help Trump win reelection. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d",

        "claim": "Says Democrats want to give $54 billion in foreign aid, and Trump is only asking for 10 percent of that \"to secure our border and build a wall.",
        "doc": "Lawmakers don\u2019t want to be blamed for the partial federal government shutdown, which is now the longest in American history. So, after President Donald Trump\u2019s speech Jan. 8, some Republicans took aim at Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for withholding support for Trump\u2019s plan. U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Concord, was among those critics. \"Just last week, Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid. All@POTUS@realDonaldTrumpis asking for is 10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall. Is that too much to ask?\" Hudsontweetedafter Trump\u2019s speech. According to theWhite Housewebsite, Trump \"has requested $5.7 billion for construction of approximately 234 miles of new steel barrier on the Southern Border, a $4.1 billion increase over the Senate bill.\" To be clear: Experts, even right-leaning ones, agree that neither Trump\u2019s request nor a wall would be enough by itself to secure the border. (Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog organization, called the wall a \"waste\" and The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, last year said the wall \"won\u2019t work.\") But let\u2019s set that aside and look solely at Hudson\u2019s math and his characterization of the bill the Democrat-controlled U.S. Housepassed on Jan. 3. Hudson\u2019s tweet mischaracterizes both what it pays for and who has supported it. Not quite $54B in aid Generally speaking, estimates on foreign aid spending sometimes vary depending on which agencies and funds are considered, according to theCouncil on Foreign Relations. For instance, the council estimates aid at more than$40 billion per year, andThe Economistreports that foreign aid levels remained at $35 billion for 2017 and 2018. As it relates to the bill in question \u2013HR 21, which has passed the House but hasn\u2019t come up for a vote in the Senate \u2013FactCheck.organd theWashington Postnoted that the $54 billion includes more than foreign aid. It also includes $16 billion for theState Department, they reported. The State Department operations budget typically includes a range of items, from embassy security to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s salary, said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. So it \"would be wrong\" to conflate department funding with foreign aid funding, Ellis told PolitiFact in an email. Hudson spokesman Tatum Gibson acknowledged that State Department funding was included in the number the congressman cited, but didn\u2019t explain why. \"The point is Democrats voted for tens of billions of dollars for that \u2013 roughly $12 billion more than what the president requested \u2013 but won\u2019t support President Trump\u2019s requested $5 billion to secure our own borders,\" Gibson said. If we subtract the $16 billion for the state department from Hudson\u2019s claim, that leaves us with $38 billion in foreign aid spending. Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion request is about 15 percent of that. Not exactly Democrats' idea Now to the origins of the $54 billion spending plan. It\u2019s misleading to cast the spending plan as a Democratic proposal. Spending at the same level was first proposed when Republicans controlled the House, as both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post included in their stories. In June, theHouse Committee on Appropriationsapproved a $54 billion State and Foreign Operations bill. And in July, theSenate Committee on Appropriationsapproved a similar $54.4 billion budget. Our ruling Hudson said \"Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid,\" and that Trump is asking for \"10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall.\" Hudson has a point that Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion request is far less than the amount spent on foreign aid. But he incorrectly included standard State Department funding in his claim about foreign aid funds. More importantly, his tweet misleads by giving the impression that the spending plan was Democrats\u2019 idea. We rate his claim Mostly False.

        "claim": "U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue\u2019s company took $3 million from the federal stimulus program that President Barack Obama created.",
        "doc": "In a provocative ad now airing on television and radio, U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston tries to tie his Republican runoff opponent, businessman David Perdue, to President Barack Obama. An Obama impersonator leaves a faux voicemail for Kingston, asking him to \"ease up\" on Perdue because \"he\u2019s my kind of guy.\" Perdue and Kingston, a veteran U.S. congressman from Savannah, are locked in a heated Republican runoff to be the party\u2019s nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. In November, the winner of the July 22 runoff faces Democrat Michelle Nunn. In his ad, Kingston claims Perdue's company took $3 million from the federal stimulus program that Obama created to jump-start the economy. Kingston opposed the stimulus, and some critics say it was a waste of taxpayer money. But is the claim about a Perdue company taking stimulus money true? Or is it more rhetoric than reality? PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know. Kingston is hardly the first candidate to try to discredit an opponent with claims of connections to the president or to one of Obama\u2019s polarizing initiatives \u2013 mainly, the health care overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the \"stimulus plan.\" In 2012, Mark Neumann, the leading tea party candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s GOP Senate primary, was on the defensive after acknowledging that his company took $80,000 in stimulus money. He lost the primary to former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. In his ad, Kingston is referring to $3.4 million in stimulus that went to Alliant Energy Co., a Midwest energy holding company that reported $3.2 billion in operating revenue in 2013. Perdue, best known for his leadership of Dollar General, has been on Alliant\u2019s board of directors since 2001, earning about $1.3 million in directors fees, according to records of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, Perdue reported making between $2.1 million and $8.1 million from investment income and corporate board memberships. At the time, in addition to Alliant\u2019s board, he was serving on the board of Sandy Springs-based Graphic Packaging International Inc., California-based Easton-Bell Sports Inc. and Washington-based Liquidity Services Inc. Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said this week that Perdue has acknowledged in the past that he knew of the stimulus grants to Alliant. \"If he was aware, why didn\u2019t he take action to stop them?\" Crawford said. \"If he didn\u2019t take an ownership role in leading the company, why did he take $1 million from the company?\" Perdue campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey said the ad is representative of \"the kind of false and misleading accusations we have come to expect\" from Kingston. Perdue didn\u2019t receive any stimulus money personally and neither did any company he managed, Dickey said. He said Perdue doesn\u2019t recall any board of directors vote at Alliant on the stimulus money and isn\u2019t a fan of that initiative. \"David believes that overall, like most spending by Washington politicians, the stimulus was a waste of taxpayer money that missed its mark while piling on even more debt,\" Dickey said. (Perdue\u2019s campaign has stressed the need to reduce the federal debt and has a running debt clock on its website.) We attempted to contact Alliant to see whether we could review the minutes of the board of directors\u2019 meetings, specifically to see whether there were discussions and/or votes on the stimulus money. We didn\u2019t receive an immediate response. We also reached out to Robert S. Chirinko, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in corporate governance issues. We asked him about the fairness of an ad suggesting that the stimulus money went to \"one of Perdue\u2019s companies\" when his role at Alliant is as a member of the board of directors. Members of a board of directors \"are merely the trustees of the company and they represent the shareholders\u2019 interests,\" he said. \"In principle, the board makes sure the shareholders/owners get treated fairly and applicable laws and regulations are followed. It could well be the case that the board was not involved in the decision to accept stimulus money.\" With a major company the size of Alliant, \"$3.4 million may fly below the board\u2019s radar screen,\" Chirinko said. The Kingston ad mentions the $3 million in stimulus funds. But the Kingston camp says much more stimulus money went to Alliant or its affiliates. The company\u2019s 2012 annual report shows that it has three wind farms that took at least $64 million in stimulus-provided production tax credits and another that took a $62.4 million stimulus cash grant, Crawford said. The Hill also has reported that Graphic Packaging, another company that has Perdue on its board, received a $500,000 stimulus grant. Perdue\u2019s camp suggests Kingston has questions of his own to answer about the stimulus. Dickey said Kingston voted against the stimulus but lobbied for and put out press releases about the federal money being received in Georgia. In summary, the ad makes the claim that one of Perdue\u2019s companies took stimulus money. Perdue sat on four company boards, including at Alliant. That\u2019s a lot different than owning, running or working day to day for a company. We think it\u2019s misleading to say Alliant is his company in an attempt to link him to the president\u2019s stimulus program. It is a company with which he has an affiliation, so there is a bit of truth here, but just a bit. We rate the attack ad statement as Mostly False.",

        "doc": "Rahul Gandhi won Wayanad seat in Kerala with a margin of around 4.2 lakh votes | Photo from Twitter A viral post on social media claims that Congress president Rahul Gandhi got more than 13 lakh votes on Wayanad seat, but around six lakh votes were deleted. The post contains screenshots from the official result website of Election Commission of India (ECI). The viral post was later deleted. Read the archived version of the post here. Rahul Gandhi won Wayanad seat in Kerala with a margin of around 4.2 lakh votes, but he lost to BJP's Smriti Irani in Amethi. India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral claim is misleading. As per the data available on the ECI website, Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency has a total 11,02,097 electorates. The actual result of Wayanad constituency can be seen here. Facebook page 'FekuExpress' shared two screenshots of the ECI website, showing the election data of Wayanad seat. The first screenshot showed the final vote count of Rahul Gandhi at 7,34,888. The second screenshot highlighted his vote count on Thursday (May 23) at 13,37,438 votes. The calculation explained in the post showed the vote difference at 6,02,550. (Here is the calculation as per the post: 13,37,438 -7,34,888=6,02,550) Hence, the post claimed that six lakh votes were deleted from the website. We found that there was a display error on the ECI website on Thursday afternoon. Due to this, it was showing around 13 lakh votes in the name of Rahul Gandhi and more than four lakh votes for PP Suneer on Wayanad seat. However, the data was rectified on the website a few hours later when pointed out. As per the Election Commission of India 2009 report, the total number of electorates in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is 11,02,097 which include 5,43,764 male and 5,58,333 female voters. Wayanad constituency was formed in 2009 and consists seven Assembly segments spread over three districts - Wayanad, Kozhikode and Malappuram. Wayanad district is the least populated region in Kerala with a population of 8,16,558, as per the 2011 Census. The total number of votes polled in Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was 10,92,197. An ECI official confirmed India Today that there was some screen display error on the website due to which the vote count on Wayanad seat was showing incorrect data, which was rectified within an hour. As the total number of voters in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is around 11 lakh, it is not possible for Rahul to have got 13 lakh votes on this seat. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Rahul Gandhi got more than 13 lakh votes on Wayanad seat, but around six lakh votes were deleted. Conclusion There was a glitch in the ECI website which was later rectified. The total number of voters in Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is around 11 lakh.

        "doc": "Amidst Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, several distressing videos of Indian students trying to escape Ukraine have surfaced on social media. On February 28, The Indian Express reported that four Union Ministers will visit as Special Envoy of the Indian government in neighbouring countries to expedite the rescue of Indian citizens from Ukraine. In the backdrop of this, a screenshot from PlaneFinder, a United Kingdom-based real-time flight tracking service, has gone viral since February 24. The image shows the trajectory of Air India flight number 121 (AI121) with the claim that it shows the aircraft flying through the warzone to rescue stranded Indians. Republic TV published an article with the headline, \u201cAir India lone airliner to brave through war-ridden Russia-Ukraine airspace: Report\u201d along with the viral image. This report was later deleted without any clarification. News18 anchor and managing editor Amish Devgan and Akhilesh Mishra, former director of the BJP government\u2019s online citizen engagement initiative \u2018MyGov India\u2019, posted this image on February 27. Both have deleted their tweets. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Using social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, we found that over 100 accounts [view PDF] shared this image online including pro-government pages like Modi Once More and Saffron Tigers. The latter shared the image and wrote, \u201c[sic] This single plane which is flying on sky of Russia Ukraine war zone is showing the power of new India. When no country has dare to fly there it is #AirIndia which is going to airlift Indian Nationals who are stuck there. This is new India under the able leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji. This single picture tells the whole story.\u201d This post has been shared over 11,000 times and liked over 40,000 times. On the same day, FB page \u2018Modi Once More\u2019 shared this image and wrote, \u201d [sic] That\u2019s Air India rescue flight on its way\u2026Modi Ji \u2013 I got Swag Mitron!\u201d Prior to all the posts, on February 24, Twitter user @QuebecTango posted the viral image and alleged AI121 was flying in a no-fly zone and dubbed it as \u2018Leeroy Jenkins\u2019 moment \u2013 a western slang for doing something extraordinary.

I saw said screengrab and immediately tweeted the Leeroy Jenkins take without realising it was a glitch. End result: cries of \u201cfake\u201d but still happy with the joke.\u201d Twitter user @YourAnonNews also shared this image and called it a \u201cmeme\u201d. Looking at the viral image, we can see that the screenshot itself reveals that flight AI121 is heading to Frankfurt (Germany) not Ukraine. As per PlaneFinder, AI121 is operational on all days of the week except Wednesdays. It was Thursday on February 24, thus the flight was operational. The image below is a screenshot from PlaneFinder that shows the trajectory of flight AI121 on February 24. It is must be noted Press Trust of India reported that an Air India plane that took off to bring back Indians from Ukraine on February 24 was called back to Delhi after Ukrainian authorities issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) stating that civil flights within the country \u201care restricted due to potential hazard\u201d. An Air India official told Alt News, \u201cAll flights have pre-defined air navigation routes guided by the air traffic control. In case of any exigences, non-availability of airspace or aerodrome, a NOTAM is issued and subsequently, a route is re-defined. I must stress that no commercial aircraft will enter any area(s) declared as no-fly zone.\u201d Thus, it is safe to state that no \u2018Leeroy Jenkins\u2019 moment took place in relation to AI121 flight. On February 25, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted, \u201cThe first batch of evacuees from Ukraine reach Romania via Suceava border crossing.\u201d The first batch of evacuees from Ukraine reach Romania via Suceava border crossing.

        "doc": "The 41-second-long video shows two policemen raining sticks on one another in broad daylight on an open street. Both are later seen bleeding from their heads. The introduction of the amended Motor Vehicles Act with steep penalties since September 1, 2019, has given rise to sharp reactions on social media. On the other hand, multiple videos have surfaced targeting cops who enforce the challans. One such video where two policemen are seen hitting each other with wooden batons has gone viral. Netizens claim the cops are fighting over distribution money collected from slapping penalties. Facebook user \"Bhomsa Goyal\" shared the video with a caption in Hindi which says, \"Challan kaatne ke baad hisaab ka sahi bantwara na hone par rujhaan aaya (after slapping of penalties, the collected amount was not divided properly, hence this result).\" The viral video has been shared more than 65,000 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here. The truth India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The incident took place in 2013 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Two constables of UP police fought each other on issues related to their duties and responsibilities. This incident has no relation to challan. AFWA investigation The 41-second-long video shows two policemen raining sticks on one another in broad daylight on an open street. Both are later seen bleeding from their heads. With the help of InVID reverse image search, we found a few clips on YouTube on the same video. 'India TV' had published this news on YouTube on May 22, 2013, with the caption \"Two PAC policemen in Lucknow beating each other with lathis\". According to this news channel, \"Two PAC (Provincial Armed Constabulary) constables in Lucknow - Mukul Yadav and Sunil Dikshit - today had a quarrel at Indira Gandhi Pratisthan here soon after the UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav left the venue.\" We found another article related to the incident published in 'Hindustan Times' newspaper on the same day. As per this report, head constable Mukund Chandra Yadav and constable Sunil Dixit of 10th battalion of PAC, Barabanki, were posted for chief minister's duty at the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow. The fight broke out after Yadav objected to Dixit being absent from his duty point during the CM's visit. This led to an ugly fight between the two. Later, both the injured constables were admitted to hospital and suspended from duty. Another \"challan\" video goes viral Similarly, another video of policemen fighting among themselves has gone viral with the claim that it was over distribution of money collected from challans. Facebook page \"Journalist Punya Prasun Bajpai\" posted the video with a claim in Hindi, \"Challan ke paise ka bantwara ke liye jab police apas mein hi lad mari (when police started fighting among themselves over distribution of challan money).\" This post has been shared more than 1,11,000 times till the filing of this story. This is a fan page of journalist Punya Prasun Bajpai. We found through a reverse image search that this video is three years old and the incident was covered by several mainstream media. These cops were fighting over distribution of bribe money in Lucknow. As per news reports, they used to collect money from street vendors and trucks. Conclusion \"Challan\" is an official government document, which normally traffic police slap on people violating traffic rules. Both the incidents mentioned above are not related to \"challan\" or penalties slapped for violating traffic rules. These are old incidents and the videos are shared on social media with misleading narratives. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Two policemen are fighting over distribution of money collected through challans. Conclusion The incident is of 2013. The policemen were fighting over issues related to duties and not challan money.

        "claim": "Says 50 million people would lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed.",
        "doc": "Both President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney say they want more Americans to have affordable health insurance. That\u2019s about where their agreement ends.In the first debate of the general election, the candidates sparred about how best to improve the health care system, with Romney calling for a repeal of Obamacare, and Obama defending the reform law.\"Gov. Romney says we should replace (Obamacare)... But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states,\" Obama said. \"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance.\"It\u2019s that last line that grabbed our attention: 50 million people losing their health coverage if Obamacare is repealed. We decided to check it out.The two plansObama\u2019s health care law seeks health coverage for every American by requiring most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine. To help people meet that requirement, it expands Medicaid for the poor, provides subsidies for people of modest means to buy insurance and requires businesses to provide employee insurance. It also creates exchanges where individuals and businesses can purchase private policies.Government analysts predict that as the law is implemented, the number of uninsured Americans will decline. Opponents argue that it imposes new taxes on families and businesses and could discourage hiring.Romney has pledged to repeal the law. He has offered a general outline of what he would replace it with, though with few specifics. His campaign website says he will limit requirements on private insurance and Medicaid, encourage \"flexibility\" in the market and convert Medicaid to a block grant program administered by the states. In speeches, he has also said he would provide an income tax deduction for the cost of purchasing insurance.The projectionsIf Romney wins the election and acts to repeal Obamacare on Day 1, there is no accounting that shows 50 million people losing their insurance right away. Obama didn\u2019t say so, but his statement referred to projections out to 2022.That said, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that Obamacare will reduce the number of uninsured. Without the law, the CBO says there will be a total of 60 million uninsured Americans by 2022. With the law, that number will be only 30 million.So if Obamacare is repealed, that\u2019s 30 million people without insurance as a result.The remainder of Obama\u2019s 50-million number originates with a study gauging the impact of Romney\u2019s plan.Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Romney has suggested converting Medicaid, the health program for the poor, to block grants, with a cap on federal funding of inflation plus 1 percentage point. That\u2019s similar to the budget proposed by vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, versions of which passed the House this year and last. (We should note that any move to turn Medicaid into a block grant would require new legislation passed by Congress.)Both proposals, Park said, fall short of Medicaid\u2019s current growth rate.\"We\u2019re talking a big gap between what Medicaid would be scheduled to grow at vs. what it would be under the block grant,\" Park said. The Ryan budget, he said, cuts $810 billion from the program over 10 years. (Campaign finance records show that Park has donated $350 to the Obama campaign.)The Urban Institute, a think tank that studies health policy and social programs, determined that the cuts will force states to tighten eligibility for the program, leading to between 14 million and 27 million people being dropped.Another study, written for the liberal organization FamiliesUSA, also concluded that Romney\u2019s plan for Medicaid would end up pushing people out of the program. To estimate how many, author Jonathan Gruber, who was an architect of both Romney\u2019s health plan in Massachusetts and of Obamacare, said he assumed in the study that states would find a way to absorb 25 percent of the cuts (by becoming more efficient, cutting down on overhead, etc.) but that the rest would have to be made up by tightening eligibility and dropping Medicaid recipients.He found that by 2022, 18 million more people would be uninsured. In a second study, Gruber assumed greater savings by the states -- 50 percent -- in absorbing the Medicaid cuts before dropping people, and determined that 12 million more people would lack health insurance.\"The bottom line is it depends on assumptions you make, but no matter what you do it\u2019s going to be a huge difference in the number of uninsured,\" Gruber said.The counter argumentsYuval Levin, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said the studies fail to account for the Medicare cuts, tax increases, and increased premium costs in Obamacare, \"and so presents a description of the law\u2019s effects on the health care system that is badly skewed.\"With Medicaid, Levin said it\u2019s \"high implausible\" that states would drop people upon implementing the block grant, which will also create unaccounted for savings.\"This all leads them to the implausible conclusion that Romney\u2019s extensive efforts to expand insurance coverage (through purchasing pools, the transformation of the tax treatment of coverage, purchasing across state lines, co-insurance, expanded health savings accounts, protections for people with pre-existing conditions, etc.) would result in less rather than more coverage,\" Levin said. (Campaign records show he donated $2,467 to the Romney campaign and $200 to the Republican National Committee.)Joseph Antos, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he found flaws with the assumptions about Obamacare\u2019s impact.\"FamiliesUSA assumes that all states fully expand Medicaid, despite the Supreme Court ruling that they cannot be penalized by losing all federal funds if they do not do it. Obviously, the poorer states won\u2019t expand in that case\u2014that 100 percent fed funding disappears in a few years, and the states then begin paying, and many haven\u2019t figured out how to cover teachers pensions yet,\" Antos said in an email. \"They also assume that states will fully implement the exchanges on time. That is also not going to happen. Some will, some won\u2019t.\"\"Conclusion: far fewer than 32.9 million will be covered by Obamacare.\"Our rulingObama said in the debate that by repealing Obamacare, \"you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance.\" He didn\u2019t say so, but that figure is based on projections for a decade down the road, and it applies to people who don't have insurance now. If Romney repeals the health care law, some of those people will not have actually gotten coverage.And, only about 30 million to 32.9 million people would lose coverage by 2022 if Obamacare was simply repealed. An additional 18 million people might lose coverage if Romney achieves his plan of converting Medicaid to a block grant, according to some studies.Obama\u2019s number assumes the worst about the possible effect of Romney\u2019s plan, whose stated purpose is to get more people covered. And some critics say the promise of Obamacare is inflated -- that not so many people will gain coverage, therefore not so many would lose it if the law is repealed.Obama is right that repealing the health care law will result in millions losing coverage, but his statement is an oversimplification of long-term projections and includes more than just a simple repeal of the 2010 law. On balance, we rate Obama\u2019s statement Mostly False.",

An \"investigation confirmed 14 vehicles had windows broken with what appears to be a bb or pellet air gun,\" reads the statement. \"At this time, no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.\" The Austin Police Department has no record of any incident that meets the description, and a spokesperson said the garage is under the Department of Public Safety\u2019s jurisdiction. The DPS is responsible for security at the Texas Capitol and the surrounding buildings, according to an overview of its duties published online. \"On September 1, 1991, the Texas Legislature transferred all duties and responsibilities of the Capitol Security Police Division of the State Purchasing and General Services Commission to the Texas Department of Public Safety,\" reads the overview. \"The Capitol Complex includes the State Capitol and grounds, Capitol Extension, State office buildings, State parking lots and garages, and private office buildings and businesses,\" the DPS website reads. Austin City Council Vote The Austin City Council approved the city\u2019s budget for the coming fiscal year during a meeting on Aug. 13. The $4.2 billion budget included about $150 million in planned cuts to the Austin Police Department, which was slated to receive $434 million in the initial budget proposal before the council. Of the $150 million in approved cuts, about $20 million will be immediately removed from the department\u2019s funding by canceling three upcoming cadet classes, reducing overtime costs and pulling money from \"commodities and contractuals.\" The money will be redirected to other programs and city departments, including violence prevention efforts and local emergency COVID-19 response. The other $130 million will be moved from the Police Department budget into two transitional funds aimed at moving certain services out from under the umbrella of the police department, including support services, recruiting and traffic enforcement. Our ruling Bush shared a video to his Twitter account purporting to show damage to state-owned vehicles parked at a garage in downtown Austin on the same night the City Council voted to cut funding from the Austin Police Department. While we don\u2019t know for certain when the video was taken, we do know that the damage was discovered by state law enforcement officers at five days before the vote on cuts to the police budget. Plus, Bush\u2019s attempt to connect the damage with the Police Department is misleading, as the parking garage is not within the Austin Police Department\u2019s jurisdiction. The Texas Department of Public Safety discovered the damage and is conducting an investigation. We rate this claim False.",

        "doc": "Invasive and exotic animals have long been common subjects of scarelore, and messages alerting readers to the supposed threat posed by some new or previously unheard-of species often spread like wildfire across message boards, social networks and email inboxes. These posts typically take the form of a \u201cpublic service announcement\u201d and are shared in good faith, and without hesitation, by people who sincerely wish to alert their friends and loved ones to an unfamiliar threat. For these reasons, the \u201cdangerous animal alert\u201d is also a frequent source of misinformation, deliberate scare-mongering, or even downright trolling. On 21 August 2018, one Facebook post went viral after it warned of a \u201cnew deadly spider\u201d breed which was purportedly spreading across the United States and had killed five people in one week. Presenting several close-up photographs of a scary-looking spider, the post proclaimed: NEW DEADLY SPIDER SPREADS ACROSS USA THE SPIDER FROM HELL. FIVE PEOPLE HAVE DIED THIS WEEK DUE TO THE BITE OF THIS DEADLY SPIDER .THIS SPIDER WAS FIRST SEEN IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN JULY SINCE THEN IT HAS CAUSED DEATHS IN WEST VIRGINIA ,TENNESSEE AND MISSISSIPPI. ONE BITE FROM THIS SPIDER IS DEADLY. US GOVERNMENT WORKING ON A ANTI VENOM AT THIS TIME PLEASE MAKE YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AWARE This spider is not new to the United States (although it is native to the Mediterranean region), and its bites are not fatal to humans, according to multiple reliable sources including a 2006 study in the scientific journal Toxicon, which concluded that \u201cBites by the woodlouse spider,Dysdera crocata, are virtually innocuous. The main symptom is minor pain, typically lasting less than 1 h, probably due mostly to mechanical puncture of the skin.\u201d Pennsylvania State University\u2019s College of Agriculture Sciences describes the species as follows: Dysdera crocata is a hunting spider found from New England to Georgia and west to California. It is also a commonly encountered spider in England, northern Europe, and Australia. The woodlouse hunter preys on pill bugs or sow bugs \u2026 D. crocata bites have been implicated in causing a localized, intensely itching erythema 4 to 5 millimeters in diameter. The bites apparently do not result in any systemic neurotoxicity or cytotoxicity. \u201cAraneae (Spiders of Europe)\u201d is a database of spiders hosted by the Museum of Natural History in Bern, Switzerland. It too describes woodlouse bites as itchy but relatively harmless to humans: \u201cThis species can bite humans. The bite may be moderately painful and has a median duration of 40 minutes, in one third of cases pain is described as severe. There may also be moderate local itchiness and redness.\u201d Furthermore, neither this nor any other \u201cnew deadly spider\u201d species killed five people in several southern states during the summer of 2018. We could find no corroboration whatsoever for this claim, despite our consulting several federal and state-level authorities. The Facebook post is therefore also false in claiming that the U.S. government is \u201cworking on an anti-venom.\u201d The author of the post, Gary Neaderhiser, appears to have something of a penchant for fake, scare-mongering Facebook posts, such as the one he published on 21 August 2018, which bore the heading \u201cHEADLESS MANNEQUIN STABS MAN IN MALL WITH KNIFE.\u201d",

Sanders claims that about only 1% of Church tithes goes to help the poor and that many in the clergy,especially Protestant ministers in the South,use most of the money collected to buy \u201ccondos in Florida and hookers.\u201d \u201cWe have seen it even in the Catholic Church\u201d,Sanders continued,\u201dyou give people a bunch of money they don\u2019t have to pay taxes on and they just go crazy and start molesting little kids.\u201d The tone of the comments attributed to Sanders didn\u2019t sound much like anything he has ever said on the record.The concluding paragraph of the item was also implausible: Senator Hillary Clinton has not given a stance on the proposal but it is expected to be a major talking point at the next Democratic Debate to be held at the new Star Wars The Force Awakens Disney theme park in Orlando FL. The description of Hillary Clinton as \u201cSenator\u201d was outdated, as the most recent position held by Clinton (and the one by which shewas mostoften referenced) was Secretary of State. The article was lifted and republished verbatim by the web site USA Newsflash on 12 March 2016, and many readers didn\u2019t notice the \u201cSatire\u201d label at the bottom.

        "doc": "Gift Article Share President-elect Donald Trump finally held a news conference, but as is typical, he often made claims that have been repeatedly debunked or discredited. Here\u2019s a guide to 14 of his more notable statements, in the order in which he made them. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight \u201cIt\u2019s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis.\u201d Trump is exaggerating. During the primaries, he was a near-constant presence on television because he frequently called in to interview shows. But he generally only held news conferences after primary contests. He last held a news conference on July 27. \u201cYou saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion-dollar plant in Mexico and they\u2019re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.\u201d Trump claims credit for these announcements, but that\u2019s wrong. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said the plan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump; he credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers. With regards to Ford, analysts say Ford\u2019s decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico has more to do with the company\u2019s long-term goal \u2014 particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles \u2014 than the Trump administration. It\u2019s easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico. Advertisement \u201cWhen we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.\u201d Actually, the Chinese hack of 22 million accounts at the Office of Personnel Management was front-page news. The Russian hacking of the presidential election and the OPM hack are not directly comparable. The Russian campaign, as described by U.S. intelligence, involved more than just hacking, with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process. The Chinese hack had a more isolated goal \u2014 espionage. China appears to have wanted the material to engage in possible blackmail. Obama administration officials said the China case is different because it was purely a case of spying \u2014 something the United States does as well. U.S. officials also said that China responded to U.S. pressure after the hack was discovered, and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced. China may have been receptive to U.S. pressure at the time because President Xi Jinping was about to visit the United States, and he did not want the hack to mar the visit. Advertisement \u201cThe Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. \u2026 And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through.\u201d This is an example of attacking one of the victims, the Democratic National Committee. But FBI Director James B. Comey said there is evidence that older Republican National Committee domains were also targeted but none of the information that may have been obtained was leaked. Comey said that the Russians \u201cgot far deeper and wider into the [DNC] than the RNC,\u201d adding that \u201csimilar techniques were used in both cases.\u201d But Trump\u2019s remarks also ignore the broader implications of the unclassified intelligence report released on Jan. 5 \u2014 how the Russian government used Internet trolls and RT (Russia\u2019s state-owned international news channel) to amplify negative reports on Clinton and U.S. democracy. The Internet trolls started to advocate for Trump as early as December 2015, well before the WikiLeaks revelations began to be released on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Advertisement Meanwhile, \u201cRT\u2019s coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism,\u201d the report said. (It does not mention that these attack lines mirrored attacks made by the Trump campaign.) \u201cLook at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it? That\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d Trump overstates the disclosure about Clinton getting a debate question. During the Democratic primaries, a debate was held in Flint, Mich., to focus on the water crisis. Donna Brazile, then an analyst with CNN, sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning was going to ask what Clinton as president could do the help the people of Flint. There\u2019s no indication Clinton was told this information, but in any case it\u2019s a pretty obvious question for a debate being held in Flint. In her answer, Clinton committed to remove lead from water systems across the country within five years. Lee-Anne Waters, who asked the question, later said Clinton\u2019s answer \u201cmade me vomit in my mouth\u201d because that was too long to wait in Flint. Advertisement \u201cThis administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed.\u201d Trump greatly simplifies a complex situation. The Islamic State terrorist group arose in response to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it began to fade after the Bush administration surge in 2008. The civil war in Syria breathed new life into what had become a moribund organization. The conflict in Syria created a perfect vacuum in terms of governance, and so the civil war became an opportunity for the restoration of the organization. The Islamic State then saw opportunity to rebound in Iraq. One factor was the withdrawal of U.S. troops ordered by President Obama. But there was also rampant mismanagement by the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which greatly degraded Iraq\u2019s military and exacerbated tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. Donald Trump defends himself from possible conflicts of interest with foreign governments. (Video: The Washington Post) \u201cI have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we\u2019ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia.\u201d Trump is being misleading when he says he has stayed away from Russia. Trump repeatedly sought deals in Russia. In 1987, he went to Moscow to find a site for a luxury hotel; no deal emerged. In 1996, he sought to build a condominium complex in Russia; that also did not succeed. In 2005, Trump signed a one-year deal with a New York development company to explore a Trump Tower in Moscow, but the effort fizzled. Advertisement In a 2008 speech, Donald Trump Jr. made it clear that the Trumps want to do business in Russia, but were finding it difficult. \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,\u201d Trump\u2019s son said at a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. \u201cWe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201d Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post in May: \u201cI have no doubt, as a company, I know we\u2019ve looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian Republics.\u201d \u201cI have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president.\u201d This is basically correct. The law doesn\u2019t say the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest. But Congress, under Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code, did exempt the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest laws on the theory that the presidency has so much power that any possible executive action might pose a potential conflict. (For more on the issues raised by Trump\u2019s lawyer at the news conference, please see this fact check.) Donald Trump defended his decision not to release his tax returns, saying the American people \"don\u2019t care at all.\" (Video: The Washington Post) \u201cThe only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters. \u2026 You learn very little to a tax return.\u201d Trump is wrong on both counts. A Pew Research Center poll conducted Jan. 4 to 9 found that 60 percent of Americans believed Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Advertisement Meanwhile, tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person\u2019s finances in several key areas. First, the tax return reveals a person\u2019s annual income. A person\u2019s net worth is not disclosed, but voters would gain an understanding of a person\u2019s cash flow. Second, voters would understand the sources of a person\u2019s income, such as how much comes from certain businesses, speeches, dividends, capital gains and so forth. Third, a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity. Mitt Romney gave almost $2.3 million to charity in 2011, while Bill and Hillary Clinton gave $3 million to charity in 2014. We know these figures because of information in their tax returns. Trump claims he has given $102 million to charity in the past five years, but a Post investigation found not a cent in actual cash \u2014 mostly just free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles. Trump\u2019s tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity \u2014 indeed, whether he has given anything at all. Advertisement Fourth, a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes. There is no black-and-white approach to taxes; there are many gray areas subject to interpretation, especially regarding deductions. Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system, so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes. Finally, the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trump\u2019s income actually goes to taxes. \u201cWe have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis \u2014 hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody.\u201d A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trump\u2019s comment that there \u201cbillions of dollars of losses\u201d in trade reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese or Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would \u201cgain\u201d money that had been lost. President-elect Donald Trump called Obamacare a \"complete and total disaster\" and said he will be filing a plan to \"repeal and replace\" it. (Video: The Washington Post) \u201cSome states have over a 100 percent [premium] increase.\u201d Trump exaggerates here, and appears to misunderstand a fundamental part of the Affordable Care Act. State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace in 2017 experienced an average increase of 22 percent. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies. Advertisement The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about 8 in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \u201canecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.\u201d \u201cI want to thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.\u201d Trump keeps counting jobs that were never going to go to Mexico in the first place. Union officials say the number of jobs saved at Carrier shrank to 730, once the official paperwork was submitted. Meanwhile, 553 jobs, focused on making fan coils, will go to Mexico, as well as 700 jobs from a United Technologies Electronics Controls (UTEC) facility. Another 400 jobs in the two facilities, mostly administrative, were never going to leave. In effect, Trump saved 37 percent of the jobs slated to depart. But Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, told CNN that even more jobs at Carrier eventually would be lost through automation. \u201c96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get. You know that story. The real number \u2014 that\u2019s the real number.\u201d This is an absurd Four-Pinocchio claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of December 2016, 95.1 million Americans 16 years and older were \u201cnot in labor force.\u201d How is this number developed? Well, there is a civilian noninstitutional population of 253.9 million people, and 159.5 million are in the labor force. The difference yields the 95.1 million figure. But the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent because just 7.5 million people actively are looking for a job and cannot find one. They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force. Who are the 95 million not in the labor force? The BLS has data for the year 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled. Trump is doing a real disservice by claiming 96 million really want a job that \u201cthey can\u2019t get.\u201d Speaking Jan. 11, Donald Trump slammed the release of an unsubstantiated intelligence report as \"something that Nazi Germany would have done.\" (Video: The Washington Post) \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\u201d We cannot resist noting that Trump was the leading purveyor of false \u201cbirther\u201d claims, based on no evidence, that Obama was not born in the United States. He frequently claimed that Obama had spent $2 million to cover this up \u2014 a number he plucked out of World Net Daily, which promotes conservative-leaning conspiracy theories.

Consequently, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the last few months has been all over the western state that\u2019s a prominent bastion of the Bharatiya Janata Party. As part of his campaign, Kejriwal visited the residence of an autorickshaw driver on September 12. \"During a conversation, I accepted the invitation of the auto driver to eat dinner at his home. I also met his family and the food tasted like home. I have invited his entire family to Delhi as his wife is from here,\" Kejriwal said after having dinner there. Following this, a photo of the AAP chief interacting with the family has been shared widely. Many sharing it, however, pointed out that a portrait of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prominently visible on the wall of the house. People mocked the Delhi CM with tweets like, \"Kejriwal made a fool out of himself. The place where he went to have food, that household turned out to be a supporter of Narendra Modi.\" The archived version of this post can be seen here. AFWA's investigation, however, found that Modi\u2019s portrait was digitally added to the original photo to give it this spin. AFWA Probe When we reverse-searched the viral photo on Google, it took us to a Navbharat Times (http://bitly.ws/uf2L) photo gallery that featured several shots from the dinner at autorickshaw driver Vikrambhai Dantani\u2019s residence. When we found the photo that featured the wall full of framed portraits, we noticed that the Modi portrait was nowhere to be seen. We also found that Kejriwal had tweeted photographs from the dinner as well. ALSO READ| Video of naked man falling to death from Buckingham Palace is from American TV show, not real Among them was the viral photo. Here, too, the portrait of Modi was missing. Instead, there was a framed photo of another person, presumably a family member. After comparing the viral photo with the one shared by Kejriwal, it became clear that the PM's portrait was later added to it digitally. We also found another view of the same wall in a YouTube video shared by Aaj Tak Dantani spoke with the correspondent. At the two minutes 37 seconds mark, we saw the same portrait on the wall, earlier seen in the photograph shared by Kejriwal. Thus, we concluded that Kejriwal's host did not have Narendra Modi's portrait on his wall. The viral photo was digitally altered. --- ENDS --- INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Vikram Dantani, the autorickshaw driver who hosted Arvind Kejriwal for dinner on September 12, had a portrait of PM Modi on his wall. Conclusion This photo was digitally altered. PM Modi\u2019s portrait was later added to the original photo.

OurTime.org cited the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a group that advocates for policies that improve housing for the poor, as a source on the graphic. Each year, the National Low Income Housing Coalition publishes a report that calculates what they call the \"housing wage,\" or the hourly wage a full-time worker must earn to afford a decent two-bedroom rental home. The findings of the study are summed up in the introduction: \"The 2014 two-bedroom Housing Wage is $18.92. This national average is more than two-and-a-half times the federal minimum wage, and 52 percent higher than it was in 2000. In no state can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom rental unit at Fair Market Rent.\" Four important words are included in the report that aren\u2019t in the Facebook graphic: \"at Fair Market Rent.\" That\u2019s a critical distinction. What is Fair Market Rent? It\u2019s an official number calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that helps in determining subsidy levels for low-income renters. The department surveys rent prices in 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan counties, and on a scale of all the rents being charged in a metro area, establishes a unique Fair Market Rent at the 40th percentile. This means that 40 percent of the rental properties in that area are at or below that threshold. So the Fair Market Rent is set just a bit below average rents in a given area. For example, in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area of Florida, the Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $951. Sixty percent of two-bedroom apartments in the area are more expensive than this, but 40 percent of them are at or below $951. The federal government does not create a state-based average for Fair Market Rent, but the National Low Income Housing Coalition created one by weighting government data with U.S. Census data on rental populations. The Fair Market Rent of a two-bedroom apartment in Florida costs $1,008 a month, or $12,096 a year. How much would someone need to make to afford that? Get out your calculators and scratch paper because it takes some math. The standard used by the federal government is that housing shouldn\u2019t cost more than 30 percent of an individual\u2019s income. That leaves people with enough money for other necessities like food, transportation, a phone, etc. For low-income individuals and families, anything more than 30 percent is teetering on homelessness, said Megan Bolton, research director for the National Low Income Housing Coalition. So if someone is making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, they can afford rent of $377 a month. Obviously, that\u2019s a good bit less than Florida\u2019s Fair Market Rent of $1,008 for a two-bedroom apartment. For a person to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Florida would require a gross income of $40,355, or $19.39 an hour. That\u2019s well above the minimum wage in Florida of $7.93, which is actually set a touch higher than the federal minimum wage. This does not factor in any housing assistance an individual might receive through the federal government. The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s largest program assists 1.2 million households, a spokesman said. Of course, there are cheaper places to live than Florida. At $653 a month, Arkansas has the lowest Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment. Even at that price, it would take a wage of $12.56 an hour to afford the rent, according to the government\u2019s definition. Let\u2019s break it down further, though. According to the federal government, in rural Arkansas, the Fair Market Rent is $561. That would require an hourly wage of $10.79. Arkansas\u2019minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. What about states and cities that have much higher minimum wages than the federal standard? Washington state has a minimum wage of $9.32, and Seattle recently raised its to $15 an hour. But there, the Fair Market Rent of a two-bedroom apartment is higher and still outpaces the minimum wage, the study found. In most states, it would actually take the equivalent of two or more minimum wage salaries to afford a Fair Market Rent. The National Low Income Housing Coalition found this to be true of one-bedroom apartments, too. This isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t apartments for much cheaper than the Fair Market Rate. At the 40th percentile, by definition, means 40 percent of rental properties in that area are at that price or cheaper \u2014 which is why it was important that the National Low Income Housing Coalition included that qualifier, and why it is somewhat misleading that OurTime.org did not. \"Absolutely, certainly there are places with rents at $377, especially if you\u2019re in smaller areas, and they may be of okay quality,\" Bolton said. \"If a minimum wage earner can get an apartment at that price, it would be affordable for them.\" However, cheaper might also have other tradeoffs, like being in an area with higher crime rates or low-performing schools, or it might just be a crummy apartment. Our ruling The Facebook graphic by OurTime.org claimed, \"There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment.\" The group left out a key distinction from the study they cite: Minimum wage workers can\u2019t afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent, a number determined by the federal governmentfor each region set at the 40th percentile of all rents in that area. That means that in some areas,minimum wage earners would be able to find and afford housing that is cheaper than the Fair Market Rent. Though, in states where rent is more expensive, minimum wage earners would not be able to afford apartments even well below the Fair Market Rent. The point is reasonably on target and applies to the vast majority of minimum wage workers looking for quality rental housing. We rate the claim Mostly True.",

        "doc": "The Titan submersible disaster is being used to sow doubt about US President Richard Nixon\u2019s famous 1969 telephone call to astronauts on the Moon. This is misleading. The late president didn\u2019t make a direct landline call to Apollo 11 , and experts told AAP FactCheck that submarines are much harder to contact than spacecraft. The Titan submersible was also uncontactable because it had imploded. The Titan had five people on board when it lost communications with its surface vessel an hour and 45 minutes after starting its descent towards the wreck of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean, on June 18 . Nothing was heard from the vessel again, until a debris field containing pieces of the Titan was found near the Titanic on June 22. The discovery led to the conclusion the Titan had suffered a catastrophic implosion . A Facebook post (screenshot here ) has used the tragedy to cast doubt on Richard Nixon\u2019s phone call with Apollo 11 astronauts on the Moon 54 years earlier. The post tries to sow doubt about the moon landing using the Titan disaster. \u201cThey can\u2019t contact a submarine from 12,000 feet in 2023. But apparently, they called the moon from a landline in 1969,\u201d the post says. In a comment below their post, the user adds: \u201cThe point was that we barely can make things work with the technology we have on land and in the oceans so how did they make phones work well on the moon.\u201d The claim hints at the long-running conspiracy (debunked here and here ) that the Moon landing was faked because President Nixon\u2019s famous landline phone call from The White House to the Apollo 11 astronauts was impossible. But Nixon didn\u2019t call the moon directly from a landline. The Nixon Foundation website explains here , Nixon\u2019s telephoned NASA\u2019s Mission Control in Houston , where capsule communicator ( CapCom ) Bruce McCandless II routed the president through to the Apollo 11 crew. The company NASA used to facilitate that communication, AT&T, said that the call travelled an estimated 290,000 miles (466,709km) one way, with millions listening in on radio and television. The US National Archives said the 1969 communication between Nixon and the astronauts on the Moon was made using \u201ctelephone-radio transmission\u201d . President Nixon\u2019s landline call was routed through Mission Control to the astronauts. It\u2019s also misleading to compare that 1969 call with the inability of authorities to contact the Titan submarine in 2023 with experts explaining that underwater communications are much more difficult than those in space. Scott Bainbridge , team leader of technology development at the Australian Institute of Marine Science said radio waves in general are absorbed by water, \u201cso normal radio comms don\u2019t work underwater but do in space\u201d. \u201cSo yes, using radio waves it is far easier to talk to the moon than to a sub,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck in an email. Mr Bainbridge said long-wave, high-power radio waves can propagate underwater but they require extensive infrastructure, which can\u2019t be installed in the open ocean. \u201cYou can use acoustics to communicate but this is slow and limited so they would have had some comms but slow and limited,\u201d he added. Associate Professor Aijun Song , an electrical and computer engineering expert at the University of Alabama , says that it\u2019s feasible to communicate with a submersible that\u2019s 12,000 feet deep. While contacting deep submersibles is possible, it was impossible for the Titan after it imploded. \u201cHowever, the underwater wireless technology (underwater acoustic communications) is very limited in both data rates (several kilobytes or less) and reliability,\u201d Dr Song told AAP FactCheck in an email. \u201cAssuming there is a top unit at the sea surface to call the submersible, we need to use the vertical channel, meaning that the top unit should be directly above the submersible for reliable communications. Only limited information can be exchanged between the top unit and the submersible because of the characteristics of acoustic wave propagation in the ocean.\u201d It\u2019s extremely difficult to communicate with deep submarines, but not impossible as the post claims, unless, as in the Titan\u2019s case, the vessel has been destroyed. The Verdict The claim that apparently humans called the Moon from a landline phone in 1969, but can\u2019t even contact a submarine in 2023 is misleading. US President Richard Nixon did not directly call Apollo 11 astronauts on the Moon from a landline as his call was routed through Mission Control. Experts told AAP FactCheck that communicating with submersibles underwater is far more difficult than communicating with spacecraft. The Titan submersible wasn\u2019t contactable because it had imploded. Misleading \u2013 The claim is accurate in parts but information has also been presented incorrectly, out of context or omitted.

        "doc": "STORY UPDATED: check for updates below. A 54-year old woman by the name of Geraldine Boudin did not sue the Paris Zoological Park and she did not claim a hippopotamus that escaped the zoo sexually assaulted her. The story is a complete fabrication originating on a humor website. It originally appeared on World News Daily Report under the title \"400-pound woman sues Paris Zoo after escaped hippo tried to rape her\" (archived here) where it opened: Paris | The Paris Zoological Park is being sued after a woman claims she was sexually assaulted by a hippopotamus that had escaped the zoo for only a few hours yesterday. The large semiaquatic mammal apparently was able to slip out of its enclosure last night after massive flooding and a fallen tree severely damaged the security fence. Geraldine Boudin, 54, owner of a bakery next to the Zoological Park, is suing the zoo's administration after she claims she was sexually assaulted by the huge beast after she was returning home that night. While it is true that the Paris Zoological Park was briefly evacuated on January 26th 2018 because some animals escaped, no hippopotamus got away. In fact the escape concerned 52 baboons (who raped nobody). The picture used to illustrate the story actually shows an escaped hippopotamus in Tblisi, Georgia who got away in June 2015. And the woman in the photo is Vilma Soltesz, a 407lb woman who died at a holiday home in Hungary after she was not allowed to fly back to New York City by Delta, KLM or Lufthansa in 2012.

        "doc": "IN SHORT: Kenyan preacher Ezekiel Odero has been impersonated on a number of Facebook pages, claiming to represent him and his church and asking for donations in return for prayers. But these are all scams and should be ignored. The Facebook page New life church-Mombasa asks Kenyan social media users to reach out on WhatsApp for prayers. But when they reach out, it asks for money first. The page uses the photos of Ezekiel Odero , a popular Kenyan preacher who runs the New Life Prayer Centre and Church , based in Kenya's southern coastal city of Mombasa . One of the posts on the page, dated 26 February 2023, reads in Kiswahili: \"Umaskini unaenda kuisha, Magonjwa yanaenda kupoona ,wachawi wako ambao wanahangaisha maisha yako wakufe wote, Watoto wako watafanikiwa, kazi unaenda kupokea, Muujiza mkubwa unaenda kutendeka katika maisha yako.\" This translates as: \"Poverty is going to end, diseases will get healed, all the witches bothering your life will die, your children will be successful, you are going to get a job and a great miracle is going to happen in your life.\" It then asks those with a prayer request to send a message on WhatsApp to a certain cellphone number. Similar posts on the page have attracted hundreds of likes and comments. Since early 2023 Africa Check has uncovered multiple Facebook pages , impersonating Odero and his church and asking for money in return for prayers . But does this page really represent Odero's New Life Prayer Centre and Church? We checked. Signs the Facebook page is fake We searched online for the New Life Prayer Centre and Church and found its YouTube channel, New Life TV KENYA . It had more than 423,000 subscribers at the time of writing. All the preacher's activities are posted on the channel. The channel lists the church's official phone numbers and the number given in the Facebook page's posts is not among them. We reached out to the number on WhatsApp and we were told to deposit KSh1,000 first to the number as an offering, before prayers could be given. Legit Facebook page The church's YouTube channel includes a link to the website newlifeprayercenterandchurch.org . The website in turn links to the church's official Facebook page , which has more than 242,000 followers. The page transparency section shows it was created on 5 December 2020. The fake page was created on 11 November 2022 and has only 20,000 followers. It is unlikely for the preacher to run two Facebook pages with different contact details.

That\u2019s what the law was before Obamacare.\u201d Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight \u2014 President Biden, remarks with former president Barack Obama on the Affordable Care Act, April 5 The president last week celebrated the 12th anniversary of the ACA, a.k.a. Obamacare, with his former boss. During the event, he used a number that\u2019s been a standard talking point for many Democrats. But the figure \u2014 that without the law, 100 million Americans could be denied health insurance \u2014 does not tell the whole story. It\u2019s been some time since we\u2019ve looked at an ACA claim, so we thought this would be worthwhile to explain. The Facts Every politician likes to claim his or her policies bring benefits to as many people as possible. The 100 million figure has its roots in a study produced by Obama\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services just before he left office in 2017. The study estimated that 2014 data showed between 61 million and 133 million non-elderly Americans (23 percent to 51 percent) had a preexisting health condition that could have been subject to onerous health insurer rules. Advertisement \u201cAny of these 133 million Americans could have been denied coverage, or offered coverage only at an exorbitant price, had they needed individual market health insurance before 2014,\u201d HHS said. Note the reference to the \u201cindividual\u201d insurance. That\u2019s because the ACA was mainly focused on the individual market \u2014 individual and small-business policies sold on the exchanges or directly to consumers \u2014 which is one-seventh the size of the employment-based market where most Americans get their health insurance. According to the Biden administration, 11.3 million consumers were enrolled in ACA plans as of February 2021. About 56 percent of Americans under 65 get health insurance from their employers. (People over 65 are on Medicare, the health-care program for the elderly.) The ACA built on an existing law that already had greatly reduced the chances someone would be denied health insurance or face higher premiums if they had an employer-based health plan. Advertisement That law, the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), emerged out of the ashes of President Bill Clinton\u2019s failed efforts to provide universal health insurance. These days, HIPAA is most remembered for its privacy protections of personal health-care data. But the \u201cP\u201d \u2014 \u201cportability\u201d in the title \u2014 refers to its provisions that sought to ensure employees would not lose their health insurance if they changed jobs. \u201cEven before the ACA, HIPAA provided strong protections for people with preexisting conditions who had access to insurance through an employer,\u201d said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cHIPAA limited the amount of time an employer plan could exclude coverage for preexisting conditions to 12 months. It also required that any preexisting condition exclusion be waived for people who had been continuously covered with no more than a short break. While employer plans were still allowed to impose a preexisting condition exclusion for people not continuously covered, many employers didn\u2019t do that anyway.\u201d Levitt noted that Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income workers, also didn\u2019t deny coverage for people with preexisting conditions before the ACA for people who qualified based on their income and other circumstances. The ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid\u2019s eligibility to adults has added 14.8 million people to the program as of December 2020, according to the administration. Advertisement Biden\u2019s use of the 100 million figure appears to stem from a 2018 estimate by Avalere Health, a consulting firm, as that was the citation the Biden campaign gave to FactCheck.org in 2020. But that number included people who might have received health insurance but faced higher premiums or out-of-pocket costs because of a preexisting condition. \u201cOur estimate of the number of adults with preexisting conditions is lower, because we focus on people with conditions that would have led to an outright decline of insurance if someone tried to buy it on their own before the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cWe estimate 27 percent of non-elderly adults have declinable preexisting conditions, representing about 54 million people.\u201d Separately, a 2010 investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, based on documents from the four largest for-profit health insurers, found that before the ACA, companies denied coverage to 1 out of every 7 applicants. That would be 14 percent, though the report notes that \u201cthe actual number of coverage denials is likely to be significantly higher\u201d than the number of documented denials. Still, if you took the entire U.S. population under 65 \u2014 about 271 million people \u2014 that means 38 million could face a denial of coverage. That\u2019s also much less than 100 million. Advertisement The health insurance market has a lot of churn, so many people may experience a gap in coverage of just a few months. One estimate, by the Commonwealth Fund, indicated that in 2020, 9.5 percent of adults \u201cwere insured but had a gap in coverage in the past year.\u201d \u201cAt any given time, most of the people with preexisting conditions would not face a denial of insurance even without the ACA,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut for people who lose or leave their jobs, they could be vulnerable to a denial in the individual insurance market based on their preexisting conditions without the ACA. The ACA guarantees access to coverage for people with preexisting conditions over the course of their lives, regardless of whether or where they work.\u201d The White House declined to comment. The Pinocchio Test Biden leans too far over his skis here. The figure he uses, 100 million, includes all people with a preexisting health condition, but a large percentage probably would not face a denial of health-care coverage, let alone higher premiums. A better figure to use would be at least half that size. He mitigated this claim somewhat with the use of the word \u201ccan.\u201d Advertisement Moreover, he claimed: \u201cThat\u2019s what the law was before Obamacare.\u201d That statement ignores the central role that HIPAA already played in reducing the fear of losing coverage for people in employer-provided plans \u2014 more than half of Americans below the age of 65. Nevertheless, the ACA certainly simplified the system, with its preexisting conditions provisions among its most popular elements. When Republicans tried to repeal the law in 2017, they discovered how difficult \u2014 and politically perilous \u2014 it was to introduce new rules and uncertainty for people with preexisting conditions.

He said it typically took about six months for turbines to achieve energy-payback time , or EPBT, the time it takes for a system to generate more energy than it took to make it. \u201cThere is extensive peer research on this point,\u201d Prof Blakers told AAP FactCheck . Prof Cutler Cleveland , associate director of the Institute for Global Sustainability at Boston University, also dismissed the claim. \u201cResearch spanning a decade demonstrates that wind turbines have an energy payback period of one year or less,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck in an email. Prof Cleveland co-authored a meta-analysis on the net energy return of wind power systems which found the energy return of investment, the ratio of energy delivered to energy costs, placed wind favourably in comparison to other technologies such as fossil fuels and nuclear. Analysis shows wind is better than fossil fuels, nuclear and solar in energy return on investment. A report for the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the median payback time was 5.4 months (Section 7.6.1.2 on Page 571). Multiple studies back this up for different types and sizes of turbines. * A 2020 British-Greek study found an EPBT of between 4-6 months. * A 2014 US Pacific Northwest Study found the EPBT of two 2MW turbines was 5.2 and 6.4 months, respectively. * A 2018 Texas study found the EPBT for 1MW to 5MW turbines in onshore, shallow water and deepwater locations to be about six to 17 months. * A 2019 European study found the average EPBT of 4161 turbines to be 5.3 months. * A 2022 Brazilian study determined the EPBT of a 2MW wind turbine was 0.494 years, or just under six months. \u201cOur own research indicates that wind energy has a lifetime payback (energy return on investment) of about 20:1,\u201d Prof Cleveland said. \u201cThis places wind in a very favourable position relative to fossil fuels, nuclear, and solar.\u201d Wind turbine blades usually last about two decades. The claim turbine blades only last between three to seven years is also false. A 2022 European study on the lifespan and recycling of turbine blades cited longevity of 18 to 25 years (Section 2.1), while a US Environmental Protection Agency report said their typical lifespan was 20 years (Page 2). \u201cThe average life of wind turbine blades is 18 to 25 years, with 20 years as a widely used industry standard,\u201d Prof Cleveland told AAP FactCheck . Prof Blakers agreed. \u201cBlades typically last the life of the turbine, nominally 20 years,\u201d he said. AAP FactCheck has previously debunked the false claim that turbine generators only last a few years . Similar misleading claims about turbines have been fact-checked by Reuters , USA Today , Full Fact and PolitiFact . The Verdict The claim wind turbines take at least four years to recoup the energy used to create them is false. Multiple studies and experts AAP FactCheck spoke to confirmed the average energy payback time for the turbines is typically about six months. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.

        "claim": "\"We've repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act -- three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs.\"",
        "doc": "With a powerful Republican ally in the White House, Sen. Rand Paul said Congress is moving fast to reduce the burden of government regulations. On ABC\u2019s This Week on Feb. 19, Paul, R-Ky., held up the deregulatory action taken by Congress as an example of the administration\u2019s earliest weeks not being as chaotic as they may have seemed. \"We repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act,\" Paul added. \"Three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs.\" We decided to review Paul\u2019s claim about whether the moves saved money and jobs. His statement hinges on analyses by the government and industry advocates, but they also occasionally contradict his point. The rules Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a rule by a simple majority vote, and then the president must sign off. Trump signed one disapproval on Feb. 14, which rejected a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The rule required publicly traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose their payments to governments. Another, signed Feb. 16, nullified the Stream Protection Rule, a rule created by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (withinthe Department of the Interior)to limit coal mining companies from releasing waste into waterways. Opponents of the rule said that it would reduce jobs in an already-contracting industry. Proponents said it would help keep ecosystems free of the toxic waste. The third disapproval, which Trump signed on Feb. 28 after Paul\u2019s interview, concerned some provisions of the 2007 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Intended to stop the mentally ill from obtaining guns, the rule required the Social Security Administration to share information about beneficiaries who do not manage their own benefits to the national background check system. Expected financial toll Paul\u2019s claim that these regulations could cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" is reasonable, said Brian Mannix, a research professor at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center. He said many federal rules can cost much more than that, though it is difficult to say without a detailed analysis. We found some reports on the effects of the financial and environmental regulations. We did not, however, find a government report assessing costs or job impact for the rule on guns. The SEC estimated that 425 companies might be affected by the new financial disclosure regulation, with average total assets of $6.4 billion. The SEC also set compliance costs for the companies at $54.7 million to upwards of $700 million (the variation is due to variations in fixed costs), though they acknowledged \"significant limitations\" on their analysis that might have made it much lower. As for the cost of the Stream Protection Rule, the report prepared for the Office of Surface Mining and Enforcement\u2019s estimated total U.S. compliance costs at $81.5 million (or 0.3 percent of estimated total annual revenue for the coal industry). That figure includes $63.6 million for operational costs, which includes commercial transport and reforestation. The government\u2019s potential tax revenue loss to states was $995,000. Paul\u2019s spokesman Sergio Gor sent us a study by Ranboll Environ that was prepared for the National Mining Association, a private group with public opposition to the rule. The study estimates the potential annual value of coal lost to production restriction is between $14 billion and $29 billion, with between $3.1 billion to $6.4 billion lost in state and federal tax revenue. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement declined to comment on the record. Expected jobs impact The question of whether these regulations would save \"tens of thousands\" of jobs is more complex. On the disclosure rule, the SEC report did not comment on potential job increases or losses. And again, there is no estimate for jobs lost as a result of reduced reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As for the Stream Protection Rule, an impact analysis prepared for the Office of Surface Mining in November 2016 said the rule \"would reduce employment by 124 jobs on average each year due to decreased coal mining,\" though the regulation might add 280 jobs in compliance efforts. The Ramboll Environ report stated that the Stream Protection Rule threatened 113,000 to 280,000 American mining jobs based on what it said was an independent analysis performed at 36 mines across the country. An expert said the government\u2019s estimates are \"much more reasonable\" than the one completed for the mining association. \"My take based on the available research is that the impact of the rule would be minimal,\" said Robert Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy,said about the Stream Protection Rule. He said he thought that the NMA study conflated the potential effects of the Stream Protection Rule with other regulations enacted in 2009, and that the study didn\u2019t account for other market factors that have caused larger downward trends in coal production. Our ruling Paul said that repealing three rules will save \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" and \"tens of thousands of jobs.\" Studies of the regulations partially back up Paul\u2019s claim, particularly in terms of financial burden. The evidence is less strong for his point about \"tens of thousands\" of jobs lost. The only information we could find for a regulation with a job-killing aspect is the stream protection rule. The government\u2019s estimate said the rule could result in 124 lost mining positions a year (though compliance could result in the creation of more than twice as many). An industry-backed study offered a much more dramatic outlook for lost coal jobs, but one expert questioned its methodology. We rate this claim Half True. Correction:The Stream Protection Rule came from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior. An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized the source of the rule.",

        "doc": "CLAIM: U.S. hospitals are earning a $48,000 government subsidy for every patient that dies from COVID-19 in their care.AP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. Hospital industry officials and public health experts confirm the federal government provides hospitals with enhanced payments for treating COVID-19 patients, but the payments are only currently applicable to those on Medicare. The enhanced payments, which are slated to end in May, also aren\u2019t contingent on a patient\u2019s death but on the treatment or services provided to the patient, they said.THE FACTS: Social media users are claiming American hospitals have a financial incentive to let people with coronavirus die under their watch.Many posts are sharing a screengrab of a post featuring an image of a group of health professionals posing together while fully covered in personal protective equipment.\u201cWait until everyone finds out that hospitals nationwide murdered people simply to collect COVID subsidies at $48,000 per death,\u201d the screenshot reads in part.\u201cThat should give people a bit of clarification on how our medical system works if they didn\u2019t know already,\u201d wrote one Instagram user in a lengthy post that included the screengrab.But hospitals have never been compensated by the federal government based on a patient dying of COVID-19 in one of their facilities, say industry officials and public health experts.During the pandemic, hospitals have received additional money for treating COVID-19 patients as part of theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES, the 2020 law meant to address the economic fallout of the pandemic.But those increased payments don\u2019t apply to every COVID-19 patient treated in a hospital, just the ones under Medicare, which is the federal healthcare program serving people 65 and over.Colin Milligan, a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association, confirmed that hospitals are currently eligible to receive a 20% increase in Medicare payments for caring for COVID-19 patients.\u201cThese patients are often very costly and time and labor-intensive for hospitals to treat,\u201d he explained in an email Wednesday. \u201cIn addition, it is important to highlight that Medicare and Medicaid bothreimburse hospitals far lessthan the cost of actually providing care.\u201dMilligan also pointed to a statement the hospital trade group released in 2020 when concerns about the industry\u2019s profits during the pandemicbecamea focus of debate.\u201cHospitals do not receive extra funds when patients die from COVID-19,\u201d Rick Pollack, the association\u2019s president,saidin the statement. \u201cThey are not over-reporting COVID-19 cases. And, they are not making money on treating COVID-19.\u201dAnd despite what the social media posts claim, the enhanced COVID-19 payments aren\u2019t based on whether the patient lives or dies, experts said.\u201cThis is a stupid lie that apparently, like a zombie, refuses to die,\u201d Gerald Kominski, a senior fellow and former director at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, wrote in an email. \u201cThe most common lie about this fact is that every COVID hospitalization (i.e., including on-Medicare) meant more payment (FALSE) and hospitals only got paid more if the patient died (FALSE).\u201dIn general, Medicare payments are based on the severity of the patient\u2019s condition and the types of treatments provided, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit focused on health policy issues. A sicker patient will require more medical services, meaning their Medicare bill will be larger.The average cost of a COVID-19 hospitalization for a Medicare patient is about $24,000, she said, citingclaims datafrom Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees the government healthcare programs. But the reimbursement for more severely ill patients -- such as those placed on a ventilator for multiple days -- isroughly $40,000, according toKFF\u2019s analysis.Social media posts citing a $48,000 subsidy for COVID-19 deaths appear to be taking that $40,000 average cost for treating the sickest COVID-19 patients and factoring in the special 20% reimbursement rate increase.But Cubanski argued that\u2019s not a fair assessment of the potential payout to hospitals.\u201cMy understanding of the estimates from CMS is that they already include the 20% payment increase in the stated amount,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cSo the payment for an extreme case would be $40k including the 20% increase, not $40k plus 20%.\u201dSpokespersons for CMS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the agency, didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment this week.But President Joe Bidenhas announcedthe federal government\u2019s declaration of a public health emergency for COVID-19 will end on May 11.That means the enhanced Medicare payments -- along with other measures the federal government enacted to weather the pandemic -- will soon be a thing of the past.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

        "claim": "Moderna CEO did not say company made 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses before the pandemic started",
        "doc": "At Davos 2023, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel spoke about how quickly the company was able to scale up vaccine production at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, not that Moderna had made 100,000 COVID vaccine doses before the pandemic began, as some are claiming online. In a clip from a panel discussion, Bancel says his vaccine and therapeutics company had only manufactured a total of 100,000 doses of vaccine in 2019 and faced the prospect in 2020 of having to scale up capacity to be able to make a billion doses because of the pandemic. Moderna, which had at least four other vaccines in clinical trials in 2019, announced in January 2020 that it would begin developing a COVID vaccine. The clip of Bancel responding to a question in January 2023 circulated in a tweet by the user @healthbyjames with the false caption, \u201cURGENT \u2014 Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel Admits Company Produced 100,000 COVID-19 Vaccine Doses In 2019 Before The Pandemic Started\u201d (here). More examples can be seen on Facebook (here) and (here). Reuters streamed the full Davos 2023 session live on Jan. 18, featuring Bancel and other panelists, including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance CEO Seth Berkley (here). The \u201cState of the Pandemic\u201d session can also be seen on the World Economic Forum (WEF) site (here). The moderator asks Bancel about the company\u2019s current production capacity to make variant-specific COVID vaccines at the 9:30 timestamp of the Reuters video (see the \u201cVaccine development\u201d section) (youtu.be/5kVbKHQjpas?t=570). Bancel responds by first recalling that, \u201cwhen the pandemic happened, Moderna had made 100,000 dose in 2019 for the whole year. And I remember walking after Davos into the office of my head of manufacturing and I say \u2018how we make a billion dose next year?\u2019 And he look at me a bit funny and say, \u2018What?\u2019 I say, \u2018yeah, we have to make a billion dose next year, there is going to be a pandemic.\u2019\u201d On Jan. 23, 2020, drug and vaccine developer Moderna announced funding from the WHO-affiliated Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to work on a potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus in a partnership with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (here). In 2019, Moderna reported at least four different vaccines in clinical trials, including a vaccine against the Zika virus, a flu vaccine, and vaccines against other respiratory viruses (here), (here) , (here). It also reported results from a trial of a Chikungunya virus therapeutic (here). Chris Ridley, a Moderna spokesperson, told Reuters that Bancel\u2019s remark about having made 100,000 doses referred to the company\u2019s entire output in 2019, not to COVID vaccines. Moderna did not produce 100,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in 2019, Ridley said. The 100,000 Bancel mentioned during the \u201cState of the Pandemic\u201d session referred to \u201ctotal doses across our portfolio: Vaccines, rare diseases, cancer - the entire companies 2019 pipeline,\u201d Ridley added, and from there, \u201cwe scaled to 1B doses just for COVID.\u201d Bancel\u2019s response in the panel session went on to say the company is now \u201cat full manufacturing capacity,\u201d as illustrated by its quick delivery of an Omicron-specific booster in 2022. Reuters has previously debunked a claim that Moderna having worked on its COVID-19 vaccine before the SARS-CoV-2 virus was officially named in Feb. 2020 was evidence the pandemic was planned in advance (here).

        "claim": "There were 14 deaths in children aged 12 to 17 who had the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.",
        "doc": "A video on Facebook with thousands of views makes a number of claims about children and the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine. A voice in the video says: \"In children between the age of 12 to 17 year old that took the Pfizer vaccine, we have 9,246 adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine\u2026863 of those were serious events and we had 14 deaths with 397 reports of myocarditis.\" Based on these figures, the voice says: \"I think you'll agree that the Pfizer vaccine, for children, is an absolute disaster.\" This is misleading because it lacks context. The figures are from a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about reported reactions after the Pfizer vaccine, but not necessarily to the Pfizer vaccine. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in How many reports are there? The CDC has said that as of 16 July 2021, 8.9 million children aged between 12 and 17 had received the Pfizer Covid vaccine. It's true that in that time there were also 9,246 reports to VAERS, the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (to which members of the public can report problems that occur after vaccination, to act as an early-warning system in case some of those problems are being caused by vaccines). Reports were generated for about 1 in 1,000 vaccinations. About 91% of these were for \"nonserious adverse events\", such as dizziness or fainting. Serious events are classed as anything where the person was hospitalised or their hospitalisation was prolonged, or they experienced life-threatening illness, permanent disability and death. Of those 9,246 reports, 397 or 4% were for myocarditis ( inflammation of the heart muscle) or myopericarditis (inflamed heart muscle and pericardium, the fibrous sac around the heart). Both can be caused by a number of different things, and although myocarditis in the young is rare, it's not unheard of in children and we don't know how many of these cases reported to VAERS, if any, were caused by the vaccine. The CDC said: \"Among the serious reports, myocarditis and other conditions that might be associated with myocarditis were among the most common terms reported; however, these terms did not account for a large proportion of VAERS reports overall. \"No reports of death to VAERS were determined to be the result of myocarditis.\" In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the government's Commission on Human Medicines assessed the reports of myocarditis following Covid-19 vaccination. Guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recently been updated recommending the Pfizer vaccine to those aged 16 or older. The MHRA assessment recommended that healthcare professionals and vaccinated people be alert to the symptoms of myocarditis, which are new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath or symptoms of arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat). The JCVI also notes that in adults in Israel and the US, \"the reported cases of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination are of a 'milder phenotype' with the vast majority of persons recovering swiftly from the acute episode, compared to more typical cases of myocarditis\". How many children died? Fourteen deaths were reported to VAERS following vaccination and the CDC reviewed these as part of the study. As the video claims, four were in those under 15, and 10 were in those aged 16 to 17. The CDC said : \"impressions regarding cause of death were pulmonary embolism (two), suicide (two), intracranial hemorrhage (two), heart failure (one), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and disseminated Mycobacterium chelonae infection (one), and unknown or pending further records (six).\" As we've said before, we don't know that VAERS reported symptoms were caused by the vaccine. The CDC concluded that the causes of death didn't suggest they were due to the vaccinations, but that the exact causes of deaths for some of those who died is pending extra information. It's true that myocarditis does seem to be a \" rare serious adverse event associated with receipt of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines\" but it has not led to any confirmed deaths in children. Because these serious reports were so rare, the CDC still recommends that children aged 12 and over in the USA should get the vaccine to help protect against Covid-19.",

Abhilipsa Panda sang the original version of the song and both versions of the song are highly praised. Against this backdrop, a Twitter user with the handle \u2018@FarmaniNazz786\u2018 posted a tweet on August 2, 2022, posing as the real Farmani Naaz. The post reads, \u201cMy ancestors were Hindu and that\u2019s why I sang the bhajan \u2018Har Har Shambhu\u2019.\u201d It also states that she will soon convert to Hinduism. The tweet racked up 48,000 likes and was retweeted by close to 8,000 people. (Archived link) On August 5, this handle tweeted that women were treated with the same level of respect as men only under Hinduism. This was the reason why she chose to sing \u2018Har Har Shambhu\u2019. In another tweet, the user wrote that she sang it as a way to \u2018purify\u2019 her family. (Archived link) Another tweet posted by the handle alleged that she has received beheading threats from \u2018jihadis\u2019. (Archived link) In addition, the handle has repeatedly requested social media users to follow them. The account has been deleted as of this writing. Fact-check Alt News found a plethora of handles claiming to be Farmani Naaz on Twitter. However, upon closely examining the timeline of these handles, we learned that only one handle i.e., \u2018@farmaninaaz786\u2019, is genuine. It is worth noting that both the handles are spelt differently. Naaz is spelt as \u2018naaz\u2019 in the original account, whereas the user posing as Farmani has spelt the surname as \u2018nazz\u2019 and they have also spelt Farmani with the capital letter \u2018F\u2019. The original handle posted a video statement on August 3, informing her followers that \u2018@farmaninaaz786\u2032 was the authentic account and all other Twitter accounts were fake. She also clarified that fake accounts posing as her talked of religious conversion, but there was no truth to these claims. However, this video was also downloaded and tweeted by the fake Twitter handle \u2018@FarmaniNazz786\u2019. This makes it seem that this is the real Twitter account of Farmani Naaz. After going through old tweets posted by \u2018@FarmaniNazz786\u2019, we learned that the handle\u2019s name used to be \u2018@Nitin_shuklaa\u2019 and was changed to \u2018@FarmaniNaazz\u2019. The user eventually settled for the username \u2018@FarmaniNazz786\u2019 in an attempt to mirror the real account. The previous name of the handle appears in replies to old tweets. (Link 1, Link 2) The real Twitter handle \u2018@farmaninaaz786\u2019 was created in August 2020. Taking a closer look at its timeline, we could not find any suspicious tweets that mentioned conversion or death threats by \u2018jihadis\u2019. To sum it up, \u2018@farmaninaaz786\u2019 is the real Twitter handle of Farmani Naaz, and all the others are fake. This is not the first time that fake Twitter accounts of influential personalities have gone viral. Earlier too, fake accounts were created in which users were posing as President Droupadi Murmu and farmer leader Rakesh Tikait. Donate to Alt News!

        "doc": "In the wake of the Oct. 1 shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Barack Obama tasked the media to put the number of gun violence-related deaths into perspective. \"Have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports,\" he said in his address on the shooting.\"We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?\" Obama's underlying point was to highlight the lack of resources and legislative action taken on gun violence. Some have questioned the merit of such a comparison -- for example, critics havepointed outthat cigarettes kill more people than guns. We're not weighing in on that debate. Rather, we're looking just at the data. Multiple outlets obliged (though each came up with slightly different numbers). Several readers asked us to check out one specific comparison widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It was created by NowThis, a New York-based news company that produces content specifically for social media. The image says that 24 Americans have been killed by terrorism in the last decade, while 280,024 Americans were killed by guns. While NowThis\u2019 numbers aren\u2019t perfect, the overarching point is accurate. There have been far more deaths from gun violence than from terrorist attacks. Walking through the math Let\u2019s start with the tally for terrorist-related deaths. NowThis senior editorial producer Versha Sharma told PolitiFact that the 24 figure refers to the number of U.S. citizens killed by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, and does not include deaths abroad. Sharma acknowledged that this could have been made clear in the graphic. But she maintained that it\u2019s more apt to compare domestic gun deaths to domestic terrorism deaths. Counting terrorist attacks abroad, she said, would make it an apples to oranges comparison. The number comes from the nonpartisan think tank the New America Foundation\u2019s count of lethal jihadist attacks on U.S. soil from 2005 to 2015. It includes for example the four people killed during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and the 13 deaths from the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. To get to 280,024 gun deaths, NowThis compiled data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Vital Statistics System and the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project that tallies deaths and injuries in mass shootings. According to the CDC, the number of violent gun deaths between 2005 and 2013 (the latest year on record) was 279,976. That includes suicides, homicides, and police-related shootings. Mass Shooting Tracker counts 389 mass shooting gun deaths in 2014 and 375 so far in 2015. There are, however, a few issues with these numbers. For starters, a spokesperson for New America told us it would have been more accurate to include lives lost to both jihadist and non-jihadist extreme violence (47 deaths from 2005 to 2015) for a total count of 71 deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Secondly, Mass Shooting Tracker, as the name implies, only tracks deaths from mass shootings, defined by the group as when four more people are shot in an event. If we look at all gun-related deaths as the CDC does from the past two years, the numbers are much higher. According the nonprofit project the Gun Violence Archive, there were 12,562 gun deaths in 2014 and 9,959 in 2015 thus far. That\u2019s a grand total of 301,797 firearm-related deaths in the past decade, compared to 71 deaths from domestic acts of terrorism. If we factor in terrorist attacks overseas, the comparison is still stark. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide, according to State Department reports. During that same time frame, 320,523 Americans were killed because of gun violence. Here\u2019s a breakdown: Our ruling A viral image says the number of Americans killed by terrorism in the last decade is 24, while the number of Americans killed by guns in the last decade is 280,024. NowThis, the creators of the image, told us they only counted lives lost to domestic jihadist attacks, though the image doesn\u2019t specify that. If we look at deaths due to all extremist attacks on U.S. soil, the number goes up to 71. A more accurate count for gun deaths between 2005 and 2015 is 301,797. Though the image\u2019s numbers are slightly off, that doesn\u2019t undercut the point: guns have claimed many more lives than terrorist attacks. We rate the claim Mostly True. ",

One Twitter user shared the photos on March 27, Claiming, \u201cBad night for #Pakistan, 3 fighter jets of #PAF destroyed in a single night. One jet was shot down by the #IAF on the #LOC, #neelumvalley, and two jets were shot down by #Iran on their border.\u201d Archived versions of some similar claims can be seen here. The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found this claim to be false. One, at the time of writing this, there were no reports of either the Indian Air Force or the Iranian Air Force attacking Pakistani jets. Additionally, the images shared were all old. AFWA Probe We first looked for news reports on India gunning down Pakistani fighter jets but found nothing of this sort was reported any time recently. Subsequently, we reverse-searched the photos. We found the first image on the top-left in a report published by Daily Pakistan on January 7, 2020. The report said that the PAF FT-7 aircraft crashed near the Mianwali Air Base in the Punjab province of Pakistan due to a technical failure, claiming the lives of two Pakistani pilots, Haris bin Khalid and Ibaadur Rehman. A reverse search of the second image \u2014 a black-coloured crashed jet on the top-right \u2014 on Yandex led us to a Pakistan Today report published on August 10, 2017. The report noted that this fighter jet crashed in the Sabzazar area of Mianwali due to a technical failure as well. The crash killed Pakistani wing commander Mohammad Zeeshan. The third image on the bottom left looked as if a jet crashed in a residential area. A reverse search of the image led us to results that suggested the same. The image was found in an article published by \"Suchtv.pk\" on August 17, 2017. It mentioned that a PAF F-7 PG jet crashed in Sargodha when it was flown from Samungli Air Base for a training exercise. While the crash didn\u2019t claim any lives, civilians or military, Lieutenant Bilal of the PAF suffered a leg fracture. When we reverse searched the image on the bottom right, it took us to the same results as the first one. After comparing both, it became clear that both the first and the last images were from the same crash site. While searching for related keywords, we found a Business Standard report that said a crash on March 22 killed two pilots of the PAF near the northwestern city of Peshawar. However, there was no mention of any kind of attack on the Pakistani Air Force. Thus, it can be concluded that the images of crashed jets of the PAF have been shared with false claims. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim On the night of March 26, three fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force were destroyed. One of the jets was shot down by the Indian Air Force near the LOC. The other two were gunned down by Iran at its border. Conclusion Attacks on the PAF, either by India or Iran, have not been reported yet. All the images are old and from PAF crashes that occurred due to technical faults. The first and the last image are from a crash that took place in 2020. The other two images are from 2017.

Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in How much has Test and Trace cost so far? \u00a337 billion was budgeted for NHS Test and Trace (sometimes incorrectly referred to as Track and Trace) in its first two years . That amount hasn't been spent yet. NHS Test and Trace spent \u00a313.5 billion up to April 2021, and its budget for that year was \u00a322.2 billion. According to a National Audit Office report on its progress, this \u00a38.7 billion underspend was primarily due to the fact that \"the high level of demand for testing forecast for January and February 2021 did not materialise, in part due to national lockdown measures.\" NHS Test and Trace is not just the NHS Covid-19 app . It also covers testing services, 'contain' activities' (including identifying local outbreaks and supporting local responses to the pandemic), and tracing services. The post also says Test and Trace was \"originally built on an outdated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet\". This seems to be a reference to reports last October that nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases in England went unreported because an old type of Excel file was used to log cases. The BBC reported that this was due to Public Health England's developers, who chose this format to pull data into a central system which was then made available to the NHS Test and Trace team. How much did the Channel Tunnel cost? As for the Channel Tunnel, we've written before about how estimates on the cost to build vary. The Eurostar website says \"The total cost [of the Channel Tunnel] came at an eye-watering \u00a34.65 billion which would be the equivalent of \u00a312 billion in today's money.\" The posts also say that it took six years and 13,000 workers to build the Channel Tunnel, which is correct according to the website .",

        "doc": "In February 2020, photographs supposedly showing a Nazi rally that took place at Madison Square Garden in the late 1930s circulated on social media: On Feb. 20, 1939, the pro-Nazi organization German American Bund, or the German American Federation, held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. This rally was billed as a \u201cPro America Rally,\u201d featured swastikas, Nazi salutes, and a 30-foot-tall portrait of U.S. President George Washington. Here\u2019s how History.com described the rally: Six and a half months before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden hosted a rally to celebrate the rise of Nazism in Germany. Inside, more than 20,000 attendees raised Nazi salutes toward a 30-foot-tall portrait of George Washington flanked by swastikas. Outside, police and some 100,000 protestors gathered. The organization behind the February 20, 1939 event\u2014advertised on the arena\u2019s marquee as a \u201cPro American Rally\u201d\u2014was the German American Bund (\u201cBund\u201d is German for \u201cfederation\u201d). The anti-semitic organization held Nazi summer camps for youth and their families during the 1930s. The Bund\u2019s youth members were present that night, as were the Ordnungsdienst, or OD, the group\u2019s vigilante police force who dressed in the style of Hitler\u2019s SS officers. Banners at the rally had messages like \u201cStop Jewish Domination of Christian Americans\u201d and \u201cWake Up America. Smash Jewish Communism.\u201d When the Bund\u2019s national leader, Fritz Kuhn, gave his closing speech, he referred to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as \u201cRosenfield,\u201d and Manhattan District Attorney Thomas Dewey as \u201cThomas Jewey.\u201d Contemporary news articles noted that around 20,000 people attended this rally, while close to 100,000 \u201canti-Nazis,\u201d made up of protesters, theatergoers, and passersby, gathered outside the arena. The day after the rally, The Associated Press reported that about a dozen protesters were arrested following scuffles with police. Newspaper columnist Dorothy Thompson was nearly ejected from the rally after she shouted \u201cnonsense\u201d during a pro-Nazi speech. Tue, Feb 21, 1939 \u2013 Page 1 \u00b7 The Plain Speaker (Hazleton, Pennsylvania) \u00b7 Newspapers.com The 1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden was also featured in a 2017 Oscar-nominated documentary short called \u201cA Night At the Garden.\u201d While the images displayed at the top of this page are often shared as if they come from a single Nazi rally in 1939, however, there were actually several Nazi rallies held at the famous arena throughout the 1930s. The photograph showing the Nazi flag surrounded by American flags, for example, was taken at a rally in 1938. We also found aphotograph that showed a group of children raising Nazi salutes on stage at the Garden in 1936. The following image shows another 20,000-person rally that was organized by the League of the Friends of the New Germany, the American pro-Nazi organization that preceded the German American Bund, at Madison Square Garden in 1934: It should be noted that these Nazi rallies did not take place at the Madison Square Garden currently standing in 2020, but at the old building referred to as MSG III, which was built in 1925 and demolished in the 1960s.",

        "claim": "On July 4, 2021, the Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter called the American flag a \"symbol of hatred,\" and those who fly it racists.",
        "doc": "In July 2021, Snopes readers contacted us to determine the legitimacy of reports claiming an Utah group representing Black Lives Matter described the American flag as a \u201csymbol of hatred,\u201d and called those who fly it racists, on the Fourth of July. The underlying claim was true, though some context is necessary to make sense of the group\u2019s role within the national Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 a decentralized effort tocall attention to police brutality\u2019s disproportionate impact on Black Americans. Firstly, below is a transcribed version of an authentic July 4post by a Facebook group titled \u201cBlack Lives Matter Utah Chapter,\u201d which we also included as the feature image for this report. When we Black Americans see this flag we know the person flying it is not safe to be around. When we see this flag we know the person flying it is a racist. When we see this flag we know that the person flying it lives in a different America than we do. When we see this flag, we question your intelligence. We know to avoid you. It is a symbol of hatred. As the post spread rapidly online, Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah, told The Salt Lake Tribunethe post was authored after she saw photos of a white nationalist hate group, Patriot Front,marching through Philadelphiacarrying the American flag. \u201cWe are seeing that symbol used in every racist hate group\u2019s messaging across this nation,\u201dScott told the local newspaper. \u201cI am telling you when I see an American flag, I begin to feel fear for the simple fact that every time I am faced with hatred, it is at the hands of someone carrying an American flag.\u201d In a statement on the group\u2019s website, Scott said again she stood by the sentiment,and shared dozens of voicemails and messages filled with racial slurs and threats from people condemning the post.\u201cThey are proving our point,\u201d the message read. However, let us note here: The Facebook post went viral, in part, due to social media posts (like the one displayed below) that erroneously claimed all supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement believed in the Utah group\u2019s statement about the American flag. In reality, that was not the case. While it was true the Utah chapter called the flag a \u201csymbol of hatred\u201d and those who fly it racists, there was no widely-available evidence of other Black Lives Matter groups or like-minded activists making similar proclamations on the Fourth of July. In fact, Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP Utah State Conference, condemned the above-transcribed post, writing in a statement to local media outlets: \u201cThe NAACP \u2026 rejects the idea that flying the American flag is a racist message,\u201d the statement read, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. \u201cThe flag stands for all the people who have lived and served to bring about the best of the American experience, that all people are created equal.\u201d Furthermore, the Utah group was not formally part of the Black Lives Matter Global Network \u2014 the civil rights movement\u2019s parent organization that connects local chapters across the world with apolitical action committee and partnerships with corporations and politicians. The Utah group\u2019s website included following disclaimer: \u201cWe are an independent chapter,\u201d the website stated. \u201cEach chapter of black lives matter has different objectives.\u201d To conclude our analysis, we reached out to the Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter with a series of questions including whether it was aware of any other BLM groups or activists expressing similar statements and why it was not part of the broader network. We have not received a response, but we will update this report when, or if, that changes. In sum, we rate this claim \u201cTrue\u201d with the important caveat that Snopes found no evidence of other groups affiliated with, or representing, the Black Lives Matter movement taking a similar stance on the American flag.",

        "doc": "One largely debunked (yet persistently shared)memecontains a list of murderers along with the claim that they are all registered Democrats. This list is largely based on faulty information that was, in several instances, culled from rushed and poorly vetted reports from disreputable web sites that were published in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting. Another name\u2014 that of Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman who murdered at least seventeen people at a school in Parkland, Florida in February 2018\u2014 will likely get added to this list; almost immediately after law enforcement identified him, erroneous reports circulated claiming that he was a registered Democrat. The internet was flooded with rumors and hoaxes in the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida shooting as internet trolls and Russian bots started to push out a false narrative about the suspect\u2019s identity. They fallaciously claimed that he was a member of Antifa, that he was a \u201cDreamer,\u201d that he had affiliations with ISIS, and, as mentioned, that he was a registered Democrat: The rumor that Cruz was a registered Democrat received a push in popularity and some unearned credibility when it was reported by theGateway Punditblog: It was just discovered that the full name of the shooter is \u201cNicolas de Jesus Cruz\u201d and that he is a registered Democrat in the state of Flordia [sic]. It is becoming more clear that this individual was NOT, in fact, an actual Trump supporter, as is being reported by the media as the result of the image that shows Cruz wearing a MAGA hat. This \u201cdiscovery\u201d was based on a voter registration record available via an unofficial Florida voter database. However, if any of the internet sleuths pushing this rumor had taken a moment to examine the document, they would have realized that this voter registration did not belong to the Florida shooter. For one, this Florida voter was named Nicolas Cruz (note that Nicolas spelled with a \u201cc\u201d; the suspected shooter\u2019s name is spelled with a \u201ck.\u201d) Cruz\u2019s arrest record also noted that he was born in September 1998. This voter registration is for a person born in May 1998. The Gateway Pundit later updated its article to concede that Cruz was not a registered Democrat after all, as \u201csome sources\u201d (the Gateway Pundit) reported: At the time of this writing, however, the Twitter feeds of Jim Hoft, the founder of Gateway Pundit, and Lucian B. Wintrich, the author of the article, still contain messages claiming that the shooter was a registered Democrat: This was not the only false rumor pushed by Gateway Pundit blogger Lucian Wintrich in the wake of the Florida school shooting. He also tweeted an image of race-baiting headline from BuzzFeed, which turned out to have been a hoax. No genuine news outlets have reported that Cruz was registered to vote for a specific political party. The only hint that of the suspected shooter\u2019s political affiliation are reports that he was occasionally spotted in a hat bearing United States President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan \u201cMAGA\u201d (Make America Great Again) and that this hat was also featured in Cruz\u2019s Instagram profile picture.",

        "claim": "Says that since 1975, redistricting by Texas lawmakers has always been found in violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.",
        "doc": "A section of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 must continue to apply to Texas, the chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus said, and a decades-long losing streak shows it.State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer spoke in advance of arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in an Alabama challenge to the act\u2019s Section 5, which requires nearly every southern state and some other governmental entities to get federal approval before changing election practices. Covered jurisdictions, including Texas, must win \"preclearance\" from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before changes take effect.Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, said at a Feb. 25, 2013, Capitol press conference that Congress made Texas subject to Section 5 starting in 1975 because the state had been printing English-only ballots, discriminating against Spanish speakers. (As we\u2019ve noted, other triggers also figured into the decision.)Subsequently, Martinez Fischer said, Texas \"was never able to preclear; it was always a fight. Texas always ends up on the losing side.\" His comments were paraphrased in an Austin American-Statesman news article as his saying that since Texas was put under the section, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it.Never?By telephone, Martinez Fischer told us that his focus has been on Texas House districts and that the caucus\u2019 redistricting counsel, Jose Garza of San Antonio, has advised that every Texas House map as initially drawn by lawmakers had been found in violation of Section 5, which proscribes changes abridging or denying the right to vote on account of race or color or membership in a language minority group.With help from lawyers versed in redistricting, including Steve Bickerstaff of Austin and Michael Li of Dallas, we confirmed numerous instances of the Justice Department objecting to--not preclearing--Texas redistricting plans.For starters, we figured there were 16 major opportunities for Texas to redraw districts statewide from 1981 through 2011, nearly all of them touched off by an immediately preceding U.S. census. Bickerstaff noted there also was some redistricting action between 1975 and 1980; more on that below. For this fact check, though, we chose not to take into account the largely undisputed district maps for the State Board of Education; there has been little to no fight there.There has been much tussling over Texas-drawn maps of U.S. House and Texas Senate and House districts.Li, who has also been a Democratic fundraiser, guided us to Texas Legislative Council timelines outlining the litigation history of redistricting from the 1980s through 2012. Any Justice Department objections on the timelines, Li noted, would automatically tie to Section 5 since the section is the agency\u2019s sole legal basis for judging preclearance, though he also reminded us that plans are sometimes precleared through a Washington, D.C., judicial panel.Coincidentally, the timelines also were cited as sources for a chart sent our way by Martin Golando of Martinez Fischer\u2019s office indicating eight instances of preclearance being denied over the decades.Garza, the redistricting counsel, said by phone the key point is that \"there\u2019s never been a decade in which the state came through clean when it comes to discrimination against minorities.\"That\u2019s confirmed by the timelines.Let\u2019s get gritty. The timeline for the 1980s shows the Justice Department objecting to U.S. House districts as passed into law and not preclearing Texas House and Texas Senate plans drawn by the Legislative Redistricting Board, a five-person panel that can act if legislators fail to agree on those plans.In the \u201890s,the department precleared the legislated U.S. House plan--though, Bickerstaff noted, a lawsuit charging that the plan unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered districts culminated in a federal court imposing a plan, in 1996, redrawing 13 of the then-30 districts. Court-drawn maps are not subject to preclearance, Li advised.In November 1991, the Justice Department objected to the legislated Texas House plan; a revised plan, passed into law along the lines of a lawsuit settlement, won preclearance in July 1992.The timeline for the state\u2019s Senate plan that decade probably should be read at your own risk. The original legislated Senate plan was withdrawn from the Justice Department before a preclearance decision, according to the timeline. Another plan, settling a lawsuit charging the legislated plan with discriminating against minority voters, was passed into law, then rejected for preclearance by Justice only to be precleared by the Washington federal court. Other judges, in Austin, ordered that plan used in the 1994 elections and, presumably, through the decade.In the 2000s, Senate districts drawn by the redistricting board won preclearance, according to the council\u2019s timeline. Lawmakers failed to agree on redrawn congressional districts, so a federal court imposed a plan for the 2002 elections before the 2003 Legislature swapped in its version, which the Justice Department precleared in December 2003 despite a memo from staff lawyers saying the plan violated the section by diluting black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts, according to a Dec. 2, 2005, Washington Post news article. Garza noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 held that one district in the plan diluted the minority vote in violation of another section of the Voting Rights Act, fueling changes.Justice denied preclearance to Texas House districts as drawn by the redistricting board. A Nov. 16, 2001, Justice Department letter says the state failed to show the plan had neither a discriminatory effect or intent against minority voters in Bexar County, South and West Texas. A Texas-based panel of federal judges later redrew districts to address the concerns.In August 2012, In August 2012, most recently, a U.S. District Court in Washington denied preclearance of the legislated remaps of House, Senate and U.S. House districts adopted by the GOP-majority Legislature in 2011. The state has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Sources: Timelines for Texas redistricting, Texas Legislative Council. Upshot: Nine of the dozen initially legislated or board-devised redistricting plans did not win preclearance, counting the 2011 congressional, Texas Senate and House plans whose court rejections are on state appeal. Conversely, three initial state plans won preclearance, though a federal court acting on a discrimination lawsuit later redrew much of one and the Supreme Court held that another one had a non-Section 5 voting-rights flaw.Bickerstaff offered his summary dating back further, emailing that by his memory, since 1975, lawmakers or the redistricting board have adopted 13 statewide redistricting plans, not counting education board plans. \"Only one plan,\" the Senate plan written by the board in the 2000s, \"escaped objection under Section 5 and was used for the decade,\" Bickerstaff said.Our rulingMartinez Fischer said that since Texas was placed under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in 1975, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it.We see a reasonable basis for this claim in that Section 5 objections have been lodged by federal authorities in every once-a-decade round of redistricting since then. Still, three initial redistricting plans won preclearance and one plan survived through its decade unscathed by the Justice Department or federal courts. In these ways, \"never\" is misleading, rendering the claim partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "After the 9/11 terrorist attacks grounded commercial air traffic, \"there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards.\"",
        "doc": "In their first debate last month, three Republicans seeking Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd Congressional District seat -- Michael J. Gardiner, Michael G. Riley and Kara D. Russo -- were discussing the role fossil fuels should play in a national energy strategy when the issue of climate change emerged.When Russo questioned whether climate change even existed, considering there is \"so much . . . propaganda about global warming,\" Gardiner, a Providence lawyer, said human activity had \"clearly\" affected climate.As an example, he pointed to the three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when all commercial planes were grounded over the United States.\"We did see in 9/11, we did see I believe there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards, that there was an average temperature drop,\" he said. \"So I think clearly there are man-made effects.\"We wondered whether Gardiner knew of some new research confirming the much-discussed theory in the 11 years since the attacks.The theory caught wide attention a year after the attacks when University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Prof. David Travis and two colleagues published a study -- here\u2019s a summary -- that found that the absence of jet vapor trails in the skies during the three-day flying hiatus had a climatological effect.Travis and his colleagues had collected the daily high and low temperatures for those days from 4,000 weather stations across the country and compared the data with the same three-day period in each year from 1971 through 2000.They determined that without contrails acting as artificial clouds trapping in heat (and to a lesser extent blocking the sun) the average daily temperature range over the continent had widened by about two degrees. In other words, the average low temperature dropped a bit while the average high temperature rose slightly.Since then other studies have questioned whether the lack of contrails in the skies during those three days after the attacks actually played any role in the widened temperature variations that Travis reported. They have suggested that the temperature change Travis found might have been a coincidence -- the result of unusually clear weather during the period the jets were grounded.When contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Gardiner said he was relying on past news stories when he made his claim that the temperature had dropped while air flight was suspended.After reading those news stories again, Gardiner acknowledged in an e-mail that he had misspoken during the candidates\u2019 debate; Travis\u2019 study showed a widened daily temperature range in both directions following the terrorist attacks -- not just a drop in temperature -- and, said Gardiner, \"indeed there is controversy surrounding the observations . . . \"Said Gardiner, \"I do a better job of illuminating a path for discussion and thought than 'nailing' a precise scientifically unassailable statement.\"Still, while Gardiner stated incorrectly what climatological event had occurred in the days after 9/11, his point for raising it was well-taken.Gardiner\u2019s underlying point that humans are affecting the climate is accepted by the vast majority of scientists. But he misstated the conclusions of a study that itself has been called into question. We rule his statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Says Barack Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf as president.",
        "doc": "David Dewhurst, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, looks past other hopefuls from his party in an online video contrasting the state of the U.S. economy and -- fore! -- Barack Obama\u2019s enjoyment of golf.The video from the Texas lieutenant governor shows Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation\u2019s economic troubles. The advertisement\u2019s money moment, though, lies in these claims that appear in red letters next to video of Obama, in shorts, golfing: \"6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama\" and \"over 90 rounds of golf.\"We\u2019re separately analyzing Dewhurst\u2019s charge about American poverty. But is he right that Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf, meaning as many as 1,620 holes?Many presidents have played golf, including 15 of the 18 presidents before Obama, according to a January 2009 Golf Digest article,The magazine ranked John F. Kennedy as the best previous presidential golfer, and his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, as second-best; Eisenhower, the article says, had a putting green outside the Oval Office.As Dewhurst\u2019s backup for the Obama claim, his campaign pointed us to a January 2012 Washington Post blog post noting that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had bemoaned Obama\u2019s \"90 rounds\" at the Jan. 23, 2012, GOP presidential debate in Tampa. According to the debate transcript, Romney said: \"We have to have a president who understands how to get an economy going again. He does not. He plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million people out of work.\" He later brought up the 90 rounds again at a Michigan campaign event, according to a Feb. 14, 2012, article in the Detroit News.Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch also offered as backup a Dec. 27, 2011, blog post by Tina Korbe on the Hot Air website, which describes itself as \"the leading conservative blog for breaking news and commentary covering the Republican primary, the 2012 election, politics, media, and culture.\" Korbe\u2019s post states, in part: \"Not only did Barack Obama golf on Christmas day, but he hit the links yesterday, too \u2014 and that round marked the 90th of his presidency.\"Korbe\u2019s post linked to a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post by White House correspondent Keith Koffler, whose website is WhiteHouseDossier.com. Koffler\u2019s post said: \"After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president.\" His summary also says that this was \"the 32nd time he\u2019s been on the links this year, a record for the president. His 32 outings eclipses the 2010 mark of 30 and is far ahead of his 2009 tally of 28 rounds as president.\"By email, we asked Koffler about those figures. He replied that as of April 4, 2012, the president had taken in 93 golf outings, counting one in 2012 and 34 in 2011.We wondered how the frequency of Obama\u2019s golf outings compared to such expeditions by other presidents. Koffler replied: \"I don't have a comparison to other presidents, though (George W.) Bush stopped in 2003.\"Bush said in a May 2008 interview with Politico and Yahoo News that he decided to forgo golf after the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello, the top U.N. official in Iraq and the organization\u2019s high commissioner for human rights. \"I remember when de Mello, who was at the U.N., got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man's life,\" Bush said, according to Politico. \"I was playing golf \u2014 I think I was in Central Texas \u2014 and they pulled me off the golf course and I said, \u2018It's just not worth it any more to do.\u2019\"We didn\u2019t immediately hear back from the White House about how often Obama has gone golfing.Separately, CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who tracks each president\u2019s activities, responded to our inquiry by pointing out that he said on Twitter April 2, 2012, that Obama had just played his first round of golf of the year, spending five hours on a course the day before. Knoller told us by email that the round was Obama\u2019s 93rd as president.We rate Dewhurst\u2019s claim as True.",

A newspaper clipping of a Tamil newspaper is shared with a claim that Saudi Arabia ordered six school girls to be beheaded for celebrating their birthday with boys. Vishvas News investigation revealed the claim is fake. The Head of Legal Committee at Saudi Journalists Association clarified that no such incident has happened in Saudi Arabia. Claim A Twitter User shared a Tamil newspaper clipping dated November 2 writing, \u201cSaudi Arabia orders six school girls to be beheaded for celebrating their birthday with boys\u2026\u201d https://twitter.com/USlasher/status/1322995058421964818 The archived version of the viral post can be seen here. We found this claim first on Twitter and then identified this claim has been viral on Facebook since 2017. Investigation We searched on the Internet for news about the incident. We did not find any authentic news reports to confirm the claim. However we accessed several news websites that has published this news in 2017. We found that the image of a woman getting whipped in front of a crowd published in the viral newspaper clipping matched with the image used in website article.

        "claim": "A dog endured \u201cunimaginable pain and suffering\u201d during heart research experiments, \u201cjust one of 300 killed in (Dr. Mehmet) Oz\u2019s lab.\u201d",
        "doc": "An ad from a Democratic super PAC accuses Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee in Pennsylvania\u2019s pivotal U.S. Senate race, of animal cruelty. The 30-second spot is from Senate Majority PAC, which is supporting the Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. The Nov. 8 contest, which rates as a toss-up, could decide which party controls the Senate, which is split 50-50. The ad uses video clips, labeled as generic footage of animal testing, that show dogs in cages, and clips of Oz in a lab coat and what appear to be notes from a log. \"She wasn\u2019t given a name, only a number \u2014 6313,\" the narrator says. \"For 29 days, she suffered in Mehmet Oz\u2019s lab, leaking blood, not eating, struggling to breathe. Twenty-nine days of unimaginable pain and suffering, until Oz took her for the last experiment. Just one of 300 dogs killed in Oz\u2019s lab. Mehmet Oz is unfit to be Pennsylvania\u2019s senator.\" The words \"Dr. Oz\u2019s killing over 300 dogs\" appear on the screen, attributed to NBC News. But the words are not from a news report; they are part of a headline on an opinion column written by a professor that was published on NBC\u2019s website. Another Senate Majority PAC TV ad made the same claim against Oz. Oz\u2019s campaign did not dispute a report that more than 300 dogs were euthanized during experiments between 1989 and 2010 in a Columbia University research lab Oz supervised. \"The operations in the research lab were carried out by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows, and the animals were cared for by veterinarians,\" Oz campaign spokesperson Brittany Yanick said. We did not find evidence that dogs were routinely subjected to \"unimaginable pain and suffering.\" An internal investigation by Columbia found that the dog highlighted in the ad, known as 6313, received \"adequate veterinary care.\" The allegations date back 20 years to lab experiments at Columbia involving dogs and other animals that Oz, a heart surgeon, and other cardiac researchers supervised. News reports about the allegations against Oz were published in September and October. On Sept. 13, the Philadelphia news outlet Billy Penn reported that Oz was directing a research program at Columbia when it agreed in 2004 to a settlement with the U.S. Agriculture Department to resolve animal abuse claims. The three-page settlement agreement, which did not mention Oz, fined Columbia $2,000. The agreement was based on an internal investigation by Columbia that was spurred by allegations from a whistleblower in the lab, Catherine Dell\u2019Orto. Dell\u2019Orto told PolitiFact she does not know whether the 300 figure is accurate, but that the number of dogs euthanized does not signal animal abuse. Dell\u2019Orto said Oz was responsible for the tests conducted in his lab. She said dogs suffering pain is part of lab testing, but that the lab Oz oversaw did not design tests to limit suffering and caused suffering by waiting unnecessarily long to euthanize some dogs. Dell\u2019Orto told Billy Penn the experiments were meant to \"model human cardiac failure\" and to assess treatments. Logs showed that puppies were not properly sedated before being euthanized and that an outdated euthanasia solution was used. Also, paperwork did not show that a dog exercise plan was approved by the attending veterinarian. Oz\u2019s campaign provided to PolitiFact the 22-page internal investigation report from Columbia, which covered Oz and other researchers. The report said that under Oz\u2019s supervision,\"appropriate veterinary care\" was given to dog 6313, and that \"inadequate or questionable veterinary care\" was given to two other dogs. The report said lab records did not say why the two other dogs were kept alive \u2014 one for two days and the other for nearly a month \u2014 after being paralyzed. The references in the ad to dog 6313 leaking blood and struggling to breathe were from a summary published by the advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Billy Penn reported that before the settlement, PETA had complained of abuse of baboons and dogs at Columbia after being contacted by Dell\u2019Orto. In October, the news and cultural commentary website Jezebel reported that, based on studies in academic journals Oz published from 1989 to 2010, experiments Oz supervised resulted in the deaths of at least 329 dogs. Oz\u2019s campaign said Oz \"never abused any animals\" and noted that the whistleblower said Oz was not involved in euthanizing dogs. Senate Majority PAC said a dog endured \"unimaginable pain and suffering\" during heart research experiments, \"just one of 300 killed in (Dr. Mehmet) Oz\u2019s lab.\" The ad\u2019s focus on a dog known as 6313 is misleading. An internal investigation by Columbia University said \"appropriate veterinary care\" was given to this animal, which suffered loss of blood and difficulty breathing. The investigation said lab records did not say why two other dogs in Oz\u2019s experiments were kept alive, one for two days and one for three weeks, after being paralyzed. On the bigger issue of dog deaths, Oz\u2019s campaign did not dispute a published report that more than 300 dogs were euthanized during experiments in a Columbia research lab Oz supervised from 1989 to 2010. The campaign said other researchers conducted the tests and provided veterinary care in the lab. The ad\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "In early May 2021, part of a Chinese rocket fell to Earth, and it was not entirely clear where the debris would land.",
        "doc": "In May 2021, narrators in viral TikTok videos claimed a portion of a massive Chinese rocket had left Earth\u2019s orbit and was falling back to the planet where it would eventually land within the next couple weeks. The catch?\u201cNo one knows where it\u2019s going to crash,\u201d one video claimed. The underlying assertion was true. As of early May, the drag of Earth\u2019s atmosphere was tugging a portion of a Chinese rocket out of orbit and scientists were preparing for its debris to potentially rain somewhere on the planet \u2014 anywhere between the northern latitude lines of New York and southern locations of New Zealand.Also, the extent of the rocket\u2019s disintegration while descending remained unknown. However, those questions were eventually solved.China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency reported the rocket reentered Earth\u2019s atmosphere above the Maldives in the Indian Ocean on May 9, andthat most of it burned up during the trip, according to reputable news reports. Let us back up to understand how the rocket reached Earth\u2019s orbit in the first place. On April 29, China launched the main module of its first permanent space station (the module iscalled the Tianhe) using a 100-foot-tall Long March 5B rocket. Here\u2019s how The Associated Press covered the event: Minutes after the launch, the fairing opened to expose the Tianhe atop the core stage of the rocket, with the characters for \u201cChina Manned Space\u201d emblazoned on its exterior. Soon after, it separated from the rocket, which will orbit for about a week before falling to Earth, and minutes after that, opened its solar arrays to provide a steady energy source. In other words, as part of China\u2019s space program, the Long March 5B rocket temporarily entered orbit in late April and its core indeed fell back to Earth with its gravitational pull. Instead of following a predetermined path, however, the portion of the space vehicle traveled in an \u201cuncontrolled\u201d manner \u2014 without an exact landing spot or course in mind. \u201cHuge rocket looks set for uncontrolled reentry following Chinese space station launch,\u201d tweeted Andrew Jones, a journalist for SpaceNews. Furthermore, the Aerospace Corporation, a U.S. research and development center, performed its own analysis of the object\u2019s orbit and predicted that it would reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on May 10, plus or minus roughly two days. However, exactly where that would happen \u2014 or how much of the rocket would disintegrate while descending to Earth \u2014 remained unknown. SpaceNews, a credible source of news about the global space industry, reported on April 30 (one day after the rocket\u2019s launch from the Wenchang Launch Center on the island of Hainan) that while much of the object would burn up, some debris could remain intact and rain anywhere between the northern latitude lines of New York, Madrid and Beijing and southern locations of Chile and Wellington, New Zealand. \u201cWhere and when the new Long March 5B stage will land is impossible to predict. The decay of its orbit will increase as atmospheric drag brings it down into more denser,\u201d the article by Jones read. \u201cThe most likely event will see any debris surviving the intense heat of reentry falling into the oceans or uninhabited areas, but the risk remains of damage to people or property.\u201d Meanwhile, Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University,told The Guardianthe rocket\u2019s landing could \u201cbe the equivalent of a small plane crash scattered over 100 miles,\u201d and thedebris would most likely land into the ocean considering Earth\u2019s land-to-sea ratio. On May 4, the European Union\u2019s Space Surveillance and Tracking agency (EUSST), a consortium of European countries that studies space objects orbiting Earth, said it was also monitoring the object\u2019s trajectory. \u201cOur sensor network is observing the object in order to narrow downtime re-entry window expected in the coming days,\u201d the agency tweeted. All of those predictions ended on May 9 around 10:24 a.m. Beijing time, when social media users in Jordan, Oman, and Saudi Arabia posted footage of the debris in the sky, and the Chinese space agency said the \u201cvast majority of items were burned beyond recognition during the reentry process,\u201d according to The Associated Press. If, or to what extent, any pieces landed on any of Maldives\u2019 roughly 1,200 islands remained unknown. It was not a first-of-its-kind event. Over the course of 50 or 60 incidents annually, objects weighing an average of 100 tons total reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in a similar uncontrolled way, Holger Krag, of the European Space Agency, told SpaceNews. However, since 1990, no space agency had deliberately left an object weighing more than 10 tons in orbit and allowed it to reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere with no clear landing plan, according to the news reports.Experts believe the core of the Long March 5B weighs about 21 metric tons. Considering the many unknowns of the rocket debris\u2019 landing in spring 2021, scientists outside of China criticized the space expedition. NASA Administrator Sen. Bill Nelson, for example, issued the below-displayed statement saying: \u201cIt is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris.\u201d In response, China\u2019s government defended its actions. News outlets including The Washington Post said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: \u201cChina has been closely tracking its trajectory and issued statements on the re-entry situation in advance,\u201d Chunying said. \u201cThere has been no report of harm on the ground. China also shares the results of re-entry predictions through international cooperation mechanisms.\u201d In sum, considering credible observations of the object\u2019s trajectory, as well as reports that confirmed unknowns of its descent to Earth before May 9, we rate this claim \u201ctrue.\u201d",

        "claim": "British citizens can make more than \u00a37,000 a day by investing in oil through a specific scheme.",
        "doc": "An online article , designed to replicate an article by The Mirror and posted through a video advert on Facebook , claims that the government has censored an episode of Dragons' Den that featured an oil investment scheme which could earn UK citizens more than \u00a37,000 a day. This is highly suspicious and readers should beware of believing it. The article, headlined \"'Dragon's Den' makes British citizens rich with oil! This episode had to be taken offline - producers are fuming!\" looks like a page from the website of The Mirror. However, the page does not function in the same way as The Mirror's real website , with a click on any of the links in the article leading to a sign-up form at the bottom of the page. The URL, or website address, also shows that the article is not really on The Mirror's website. Full Fact could not find any version of this article on The Mirror's real website. A shortened version of the page URL also links back to a website called Ukfuture which  consists of 25 news posts\u2014many of which appear simply to be copy-and-paste versions of articles taken from news sites such as the BBC , the Guardian and Australian broadcaster Nine News . The aim of the article appears to be to persuade the reader to sign up to what it says is \"an automated oil trading platform\" called Oil Profit. This is described at one point as a \"reputable British broker\". We could find no mention of a brokerage called Oil Profit on Companies House , indicating that it has not been registered as a real business in the UK. Another indication that the claims made in the article are suspicious is the source of the post\u2014a page for what appears to be a furniture shop with no linked website or contact details. The page has just four publicly available posts , all of which were published on the same day, 26 February\u2014the same day the page was created. Scams that resemble this have been documented in the past. Which? magazine posted a video in November 2019 specifically looking at adverts featuring Dragons' Den stars supposedly promoting bitcoin investments. While the new article we checked features contemporary references such as the 17th series of Dragon's Den, which finished airing in March 2020 , and the Covid-19 crisis, the approach based on a trading platform supposedly recommended by Dragons Den investors appears to be extremely similar. The link shared on Facebook also appears to alternate between the Mirror story and a different story, which falsely claims that Deborah Meaden has made more than \u00a311m through a Bitcoin scheme. In a statement on her website Meaden addressed claims about her supposed investment in Bitcoin. \"I have made no such investments and have no such associations,\" she said, adding that she is in the process of taking action against people who used her name and image to promote the scams. Since it asks people for money, and is promoted by a false Mirror article and another false story about Deborah Meaden, this scheme is very suspicious and readers should be cautious.",

        "claim": "Says David Clarke reduced the number of Milwaukee County sheriff's deputies \"from about 700 and something to 300 and something.\"",
        "doc": "Has tough-talking Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has apparently landed a post in the administration of President Donald Trump, actually slashed the number of his deputies by half or more? That\u2019s the attack from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the millionaire son of the co-founder of the Boston Scientific medical device company and a political nemesis of Clarke\u2019s. On May 18, 2017, the day after after Clarke announced he would be joining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, Abele was asked on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee what legacy Clarke would leave behind. (Clarke said he would take on his new post in June 2017, but the Trump administration has not confirmed Clarke\u2019s announcement. Two days after Abele\u2019s comments, CNN reported that Clarke plagiarized parts of his master\u2019s thesis. Clarke has denied that accusation, but has said the report could kill his appointment.) Abele, who was once accused by Clarke of having \"penis envy,\" said Clarke\u2019s legacies include reducing the number of deputies \"long before I was there from about 700 and something to 300 and something.\" Given that Clarke, who calls himself \"America\u2019s sheriff,\" has built a reputation on Fox News and elsewhere as being tough on crime, let\u2019s see if Abele\u2019s statement is on point. Sheriff\u2019s role on crime Clarke\u2019s national profile as a favorite of conservatives has risen largely because of his blunt comments on crime, among other topics. In a 2013 interview, he advised citizens, in the context of a home invasion, to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option.\" But given that all of Milwaukee County is served by city and village police departments, the role of the Sheriff\u2019s Office isn\u2019t on the front line as much in fighting crime. In 2011, we rated Half True a claim by Abele that the sheriff\u2019s office \"plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency.\" We noted at the time that Abele had proposed with his county budget cutting 240 positions from the sheriff\u2019s office. That underscores an important point in weighing Abele\u2019s claim: It\u2019s the not the sheriff alone who determines how many deputies there will be. In the annual county budget process, the sheriff asks for a certain number of deputies; then the county executive recommends a number as part of an overall county budget proposal; and ultimately a number is authorized when the County Board of Supervisors approves the county budget. The numbers (Note: All of the deputy figures in this article are authorized positions, rather than an actual count of deputies, given that the number fluctuates with retirements, resignations, etc.) With the 2002 budget that Clarke inherited after he was elected, there were 649 deputy positions authorized for the sheriff\u2019s office. In the 2011 budget, the final one before Abele took over as county executive, there were 328 deputy positions. The executive during those years was Wisconsin\u2019s current governor, Republican Scott Walker. So, as far as the numbers go, Abele was high with the first part of his claim but on target with the second part. But the thrust of Abele\u2019s claim is that Clarke reduced the deputy positions. This chart shows the number of deputies Clarke sought with his budget request; the number that were recommended by Walker with his full county budget proposal; and the number that were ultimately authorized in the final budget approved by the County Board. Again, we\u2019re looking at the period before Abele took over as county executive. Year Deputies requested by sheriff Deputies recommended by county executive Deputies authorized by County Board 2003 * 627 625 2004 * 573 593 2005 * 588 588 2006 538 519 519 2007 443 443 475 2008 457 457 457 2009 439 435 435 2010 393 393 393 2011 328 328 328 *Not available The figures, from the county budget office, are incomplete for the first three years. The number of deputies ultimately authorized by the County Board dropped by 37 by 2005, but the figures don\u2019t show whether Clarke requested any reductions. In any case, 2005 was an important year. In that budget, Clarke requested and the County Board approved, changing 200 positions in the county jail from deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. The change was not immediate; as deputies left the jail jobs, they were replaced by correctional officers. Over the next several years, the number of deputies steadily declined. In fact, Clarke requested fewer deputies than he did in the previous year in each year but one between 2006 and 2011 -- when he requested and was authorized 328 deputy positions. So, there were 649authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office and only 328 by the time Abele took office. That\u2019s a reduction of 321 deputy positions. But the reduction in total force was less, given that 200 of the deputies were jailers who were replaced by correctional officers. Our rating Abele said that before he took over as county executive, Clarke reduced the number of sheriff\u2019s deputies from about 700 to about 300. The sheriff\u2019s office had 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office in 2003 and 328 in 2011, the final county budget before Abele took over. That\u2019s a total reduction of 321. Incomplete county records don\u2019t indicate whether deputy reductions during first three years were requested by Clarke or were simply made by the County Board. But in 2005, he requested and was granted a gradual turnover of 200 positions in the county jail from being deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. So, at least 200 of the 321 deputy reductions were specifically requested by Clarke, although those 200 deputies were jailers who were replaced by lower-paid correctional officers. We rate Abele\u2019s statement Half True.",

        "claim": "\"Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected -- $1.8 TRILLION?\"",
        "doc": "U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, tweeted a claim that\u2019s been racing through Republican circles in response to updated cost projections of the national health reform law.\"Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected - $1.8 TRILLION?\" Cruz tweeted March 19, 2012.Other politicians have been making similar claims since the Congressional Budget Office released a new report March 13, 2012, about the law\u2019s expected costs. Fox News also ran a story saying the health law will cost twice as much as originally estimated.A close read of the report indicates that cost projections have increased -- but have not nearly doubled. The health care law, passed in 2010, helps individuals obtain health coverage by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies for moderate-income Americans to purchase insurance.In 2010, the CBO analyzed cost projections, which go up over time as more provisions of the law are implemented. In that report, the gross cost to the government for coverage was projected at $938 billion. That figure -- again, the gross cost -- didn\u2019t take into account revenue offsets, such as new taxes on the wealthy and penalties paid by individuals and employers who don\u2019t opt into insurance. Those payments bring down the law\u2019s net cost.The CBO\u2019s latest report updates those figures, but it looks at different years. The new gross estimate is $1.762 trillion -- the figure cited in Cruz\u2019s tweet. But it looks at costs over 11 years -- 2012-2022 -- whereas the earlier report\u2019s figure was for 10 years. And it\u2019s important to note that the timespan of 2012 through 2022 covers nine years when the law is fully implemented (and thus its costs are greater).So, when we compare the years encompassed in both reports (2012 through 2019), here\u2019s how that apples-to-apples comparison shakes out.In the CBO\u2019s first estimate, the gross figure is $931 billion.In the new estimate, the figure is $1.01 trillion.That\u2019s an increase of 8.6 percent -- far short of Cruz's claim that it is \"nearly twice as much.\"Ezra Klein pointed out in the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog that the cost went up \"because the recession has made people poorer, and so the health-care law is going to have to spend more to help them get health insurance.\"Finally, when comparing net figures from the CBO -- which certainly provide a more true-to-life picture of the law\u2019s cost than gross numbers -- the projection for those eight years is actually less. The CBO estimated it at $784 billion in 2010 and revised that to $768 billion in 2012. Cruz's spokesman responded to our inquiry by suggesting that the CBO's original cost projection was misleadingly low because it covered years before the law was fully implemented. \"Even the new CBO score includes two years before the law goes into full effect, so the eventual CBO score for the first 10 years of full implementation will be far higher than the new $1.76 trillion cost-of-coverage in the latest CBO score,\" spokesman James Bernsen wrote. But that also ignores the revenue that will be coming in from taxes and penalties, which drive the overall cost down.Cruz\u2019s tweet saying that the cost of health reform has nearly doubled does not reflect an accurate comparison of dollars or years. When the CBO\u2019s early projections are held up to new projections accurately, the gross cost increase is 8.6 percent. Cruz was a long way off. We rate his claim False. Editor's note: When our story first published, we hadn't heard back from Cruz's campaign. A short time later, we received an email from his spokesman and we updated the story to include his response.",

        "claim": "\"I have had to fill out FEC reports for the past six years now, and they\u2019re much more detailed than a tax return...\"",
        "doc": "Congressman Tom Marino, R-Pa., has not wavered in his support of Donald Trump over the past few months, even in the midst of Trump\u2019s current tax return controversy. \"I have had to fill out FEC reports for the past six years now, and they\u2019re much more detailed than a tax return...\" Marino said in an effort to defend Trump in a recent interview on MSNBC. Federal Election Commission reports and tax filings can puzzle even the wonkiest of political observers. So out of these two tedious documents, which one is more detailed? And are they even worth comparing? Asked about why the congressman considers FEC filings to be more detailed, Marino\u2019s communications director, Ainsley Holyfield, did not provide a clear answer. She described the length of Trump\u2019s FEC filing -- 92 pages -- and added that there was no law requiring candidates to file tax returns. \"We do believe these are comparable as they are both gathering in-depth financial information related to a person or entity,\" she said. \"If the intent is to understand a person\u2019s financial status, the same information can be gathered from both documents.\" Assets versus income Presidential candidates are required to disclose all of their assets with the FEC. In July 2015, Trump released a 92-page personal financial disclosure report, or FEC report, that listed all of his assets. Although the PFD contains details about all of Trump\u2019s assets, it does not necessarily contain accurate information about the value of each asset. For example, the report lists the value of the Philadelphia branch of Trump National Golf Club as somewhere between \"$5,000,001 - $25,000,000.\" Furthermore, a PFD is not audited. There is no government agency that validates the accuracy of presidential PFDs, so it is up to the candidate to accurately assess the value and income earned from each asset. A tax return, experts say, serves a different purpose. A tax return, which is audited, requires precise numbers for each income-earning asset. It does not include assets that do not earn an income, but contains numbers for the assets that it does list, not broad ranges like \"$5,000,001 - $25,000,000.\" Brett Kappel, a partner with Akerman LLP and an election lawyer with over 25 years of experience, argues that the two documents are different by design. \"The personal financial disclosure report is designed to disclose potential financial conflicts of interest, so it requires much greater disclosure of assets than a tax return.\" said Kappel. \"A tax return is designed to capture income, so it contains much more information about income derived from assets.\" In other words, a tax return reflects how much income a person makes from their assets, and an FEC filing contains how many assets a person has. But which is more detailed? To begin answering this question, we asked Kappel if any significant information could be found in Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns that is not present in his FEC report. In recent news, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, arguing that \"there\u2019s nothing to learn from them.\" Kappel said at least three things could be learned from a tax return: \"actual income, charitable contributions and use of offshore accounts to hold and/or shelter income.\" A tax return will not reveal information like Trump\u2019s net worth, but it will show his annual income and his charitable contributions. Much of Trump\u2019s campaign is built around his image as a successful and generous businessman. A tax return would contain information that could either validate or discredit this image. On Feb. 25, Trump tweeted a picture of him signing what he called a recent tax return. The stack of tax return papers rises far above Trump\u2019s head while he is sitting at his desk. In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said the picture he gave had \"about 2 1/2 feet of tax returns standing in front of [him].\" On the other hand, Trump\u2019s PFD on the Federal Election Commission\u2019s website spans 92 pages. David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning tax expert, believes that a tax return is more detailed than the form the FEC requires presidential candidates to fill out. \"Look at the online photo of Trump next to what he says is his tax return\" said Johnston. \"Then get the FEC form, which runs far less than one ream of paper.\" Trump\u2019s recent tax return seems to span significantly more pages than his PFD, but according to Johnston that\u2019s not the biggest problem with Marino\u2019s comparison. \"The point,\" he said, \"is that Rep. Marino is mixing oranges with horse apples.\" Our ruling Tom Marino said that a presidential FEC report is much more detailed than a tax return. The primary purpose of an FEC report is to list assets. A tax return provides detailed information about each income-earning asset. It may not list all of the filer\u2019s assets -- as an FEC report would -- but it requires accurate income calculations for the assets that actually produce income. Also, an FEC report is not audited. Given the differences in the two types of forms, a comparison between the two is irrelevant, and experts say a tax return requires more exact measures of how much a person makes. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "Says Marco Rubio \"skipped 18 defense votes including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.\"",
        "doc": "Marco Rubio has been repeatedly attacked for missing Senate votes while campaigning for president. Now a PAC supporting Ted Cruz has zeroed in on particular missed votes that relate to defense spending. \"Did you know Marco Rubio skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS?\" asks the narrator in an ad from Keep the Promise 1, a PAC largely funded by a New York hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer. Those are fighting words in an ongoing battle between Cruz, the Texas senator, and Rubio, the Florida senator, about defense votes. But is it accurate? Yes, Rubio skipped the votes. But this ad misleads by failing to tell the full picture. It doesn\u2019t tell viewers that all of Rubio\u2019s skipped votes pertain to one bill, and that Rubio voted for the overall bill, while Cruz actually voted against it. A spokeswoman said the PAC didn\u2019t have a plan yet regarding where the ad will run, but Politico reported that it will air in Florida, where voting by mail and at early sites is already underway leading up to the March 15 primary. Defense votes The ad cites a Feb. 17 article in Breitbart, a conservative website, about Rubio skipping 18 defense votes in 2015. These votes relate to a single bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, which sets spending and policies for the Defense Department, for military construction and for security programs within the Energy Department. Eleven of the 18 skipped votes cited by Breitbart were on amendments before the bill passed. Other votes were procedural or largely after the Senate passed the bill, for example, working out differences between the two chambers or on the conference report before the bill went to President Barack Obama. Rubio\u2019s skipped votes included amendments to revise the definition of spouse for veterans benefits, reaffirm the prohibition on torture and to improve cybersecurity. (Cruz himself skipped three of the 18 votes that Rubio missed.) The ad emphasized that one of Rubio\u2019s missed votes was to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS. Two days before the Senate voted on the final bill, Rubio skipped a vote on an amendment to provide weapons and training for the Kurdistan Regional Government. On June 16, the Senate voted 54-45 for the amendment, but that wasn\u2019t high enough to meet the 60 votes threshold for passage. Although Rubio skipped the vote, he was a co-sponsor of the amendment. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the original co-sponsor along with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a statement that the goal was to arm the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces \"who are a critical partner in the fight against ISIS.\" The Obama administration urged the Senate to reject the amendment, and Defense Secretary Ash Carter wrote a letter saying it could push the government of Iraq closer to Iran, Politico wrote. On June 18, Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill, which passed the Senate by 71-25 about a month after the bill passed the House. The ad omits that Rubio voted for the defense bill, and that Cruz voted against it. Cruz said that although the bill will \"increase military readiness,\" he said he could not vote for the bill because he promised, \"I would not vote for an NDAA that continued to allow the president to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by indefinitely detaining them without due process.\" The rest of Rubio\u2019s skipped votes were after the bill passed the Senate. Obama vetoed the bill on Oct. 22 in part because it prohibited funds to close Guantanamo Bay, one of his 2008 campaign promises. But after Obama signed a two-year budget deal, he signed the defense authorization bill on Nov. 25. Is it misleading to attack Rubio for missing 18 votes when they are the same bill? \"On the 18 votes, it is sort of fair, although of course not quite the same severity in terms of negligence of missing votes on 18 separate bills,\" said Norm Ornstein, political scientist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"But the vast majority of the votes were on important things, and it is a key bill that is right in Rubio's self-proclaimed wheelhouse, so I see it as fair game.\" We sent a summary of our findings to Rubio\u2019s spokespersons and did not get a reply. Our ruling A pro-Cruz PAC said that Marco Rubio \"skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.\" The ad is misleading because it omits that the 18 votes related to the same bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, a comprehensive defense bill. The ad also omits that Rubio voted for the overall bill, which passed the Senate. The majority of the skipped votes were amendments, while many others were procedural or related to votes after the bill passed the Senate. The ad also omits that Cruz voted against the bill.

Netizens are sharing the video with captions applauding the actor for being fit at 84 and recreating the dance performance. BOOM reached out to Helen's son-in-law Atul Agnihotri who confirmed to us that it is not the octogenarian actor in the viral video. The video shows two elderly people dancing to the song 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu' as a crowd cheer and applaud the performance. The video is circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook with the caption, \"Helen ji at the age of 84 .So graceful and energetic. Enjoy her beautiful dance.\" Click here, here , here , here and here for archive of Facebook posts. 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu' sung by Geeta Dutt, from the film Howrah Bridge (1958) was originally picturised on actor Helen and is considered one of the iconic dance songs of the Hindi film industry. The actor was 19 or 20 years of age at the time the song was shot. The viral caption has lauded the actor for supposedly recreating the dance in her 80s. The video is also doing the rounds on WhatsApp with the same caption. BOOM reached out to filmmaker and producer Atul Agnihotri, who is married to Helen's step daughter Alvira Khan Agnihotri. Atul Agnihotri confirmed to BOOM that it is not Helen in the video. \"This is not Helen Aunty,\" Agnihotri told BOOM. Furthermore, BOOM checked recent photographs of Helen where she made a public appearance this month. The comparison between the photos of Helen and the woman in the viral dance clearly show that both are not the same. BOOM was not able to independently verify the identity of the woman in the video. We will update the story when we confirm the woman's identity.",

        "claim": "\"If Gov. Romney's plan goes into effect \u2026 the average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.\"",
        "doc": "Vice President Joe Biden used his podium in the retirement mecca of Boca Raton, Fla., to push the message that Mitt Romney plans to raise taxes on millions of seniors.At a rally on Sept. 28, 2012, Biden told the crowd, \"If Gov. Romney's plan goes into effect, it can mean that everyone -- every one of you -- would be paying more on taxes on your Social Security. The average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.\"The statement draws on an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates.The Obama campaign has used the study to make a number of claims about Romney\u2019s plan, at times leaping to a worst-case-scenario conclusion. Here, we\u2019ll check whether Biden\u2019s statement accurately reflects how Romney\u2019s proposal could impact Social Security benefits. Romney\u2019s tax proposalRomney has not released a complete tax plan, but he has outlined some specifics on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. He also has suggested these general guidelines:\u2022 The rate cuts would be paid for without adding to the deficit.\u2022 People at the high end \"will still pay the same share of the tax burden they\u2019re paying now.\"\u2022 Everyone would see tax rate reductions.Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent.To offset those cuts, Romney has indicated that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes, though he hasn\u2019t said which ones would go away.Digging into the planKnowing all that, the Tax Policy Center study attempted to discern the effect of Romney\u2019s tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance.To keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs for top earners first. They determined that in order to reach the $360 billion needed to offset the rate cut, deductions would also have to be axed for people with incomes below $200,000. The effects of that were significant, the authors found. Many popular tax breaks are of greatest benefit to middle- and lower-income families, so eliminating them meant outright tax increases for everyone with incomes below $200,000.This is where Biden\u2019s Social Security claim comes in.Couples making less than $32,000 pay no taxes on their Social Security income. Those making between $32,000 and $44,000 pay taxes on 50 percent of Social Security, while those above $44,000 are taxed on 85 percent of their benefits.The Obama campaign pointed out that in 2010, just over 29 million income tax returns were filed with untaxed Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits from individuals making $200,000 or less, for a total of about $29 billion in total benefits. So the average tax benefit was $987. Under Romney\u2019s plan, the value of the tax benefit would be reduced to $789, the campaign reasoned.The Tax Policy Center study determined that 58 percent of middle-class taxpayers\u2019 deductions would have to be eliminated to make Romney\u2019s plan work. So by the Obama campaign\u2019s math, when deductions are cut by that much, the average tax benefit on Social Security income would be further reduced to $331, the equivalent of a $458 tax increase.The problem with that mathThe bottom line of the Tax Policy Center study is that Romney can't keep all his goals based on what is known of his plan. Unless some factors are tweaked, many middle-class taxpayers would end up paying more. Romney has said repeatedly he won\u2019t let that happen.In addition, there are factors the study, admittedly, does not take into account. It doesn\u2019t factor in Romney\u2019s proposed spending cuts, or the expected economic growth that would result from the rate cuts and lead to greater revenues. In a Frequently Asked Questions fact sheet, the study\u2019s authors acknowledge that Romney\u2019s plan cannot be fully scored because it lacks detail. Their study, they said, examines the \"broad implications.\"They also state directly that the study does not say Romney wants to raise taxes on the middle class.\"We said that simultaneously achieving all (of his tax goals) would result in lower taxes for high-income households and thus \u2013 because of the revenue-neutrality constraint \u2013 would require raising taxes on other households,\" the authors wrote.Donald Marron, the Tax Policy Center director, wrote on the center\u2019s blog, \"I don\u2019t interpret this as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class.\"Although Romney has not shown how he would pay for his rate cuts, he has said he will protect deductions for the middle class. His campaign has floated some vague ideas, such as capping the value of some deductions for high earners, which could be one way to keep the tax burden from increasing for those further down the income scale.Our rulingBiden said that under Romney\u2019s tax plan \"the average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.\"That figure is just one way to fill in the blanks in Romney\u2019s largely unexplained tax proposal. It\u2019s an average of a hypothetical, and it\u2019s at odds with what Romney has said he\u2019ll do, which is to protect deductions for the middle class and not raise taxes.Biden\u2019s comment leaps to several conclusions to arrive at the dollar figure he cites. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "claim": "\"One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years.\"",
        "doc": "A May 2014 video ad opens with the narrator saying: \"One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years. And since people can\u2019t bring their roads with them, that means we\u2019ll have a lot of extra cars without additional driving space.\" If only to mull the narrator\u2019s drawl, we recommend you watch the ad from Texas Future, an entity that has surfaced in advance of November 2014 balloting on a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing lawmakers to tap the state\u2019s rainy day fund for road projects. We wondered about the 1,000-a-day statement and the declared link to 15 million more residents within a quarter century. 1,000 additional Texans a day We\u2019re ready to deem \"1,000 people a day move to Texas\" a golden oldie of flawed factoids, because it doesn\u2019t acknowledge people routinely quit the state, too. The state demographer, Lloyd Potter, who we asked about the group\u2019s claim, counseled by phone that more than 1,000 people a day may have moved to Texas from other states and countries from July 2012 through June 2013, but plenty of people also left, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Potter noted by email that net migration over the 12 months -- people moving in less people moving out -- totaled 177,715. \"Dividing that by 365, we estimate that there were on average 487 net migrants to Texas each day,\" Potter emailed. That\u2019s not as high (or catchy) as what Texas Future said. But there\u2019s a way to get to a factually stout rendition of the 1,000 factoid. Overall, Potter and Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, previously cited the bureau\u2019s Texas estimates to say the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over the 12 months -- taking into account net migration as well as births here outpacing deaths. We gathered a slightly longer view of the 1,000-a-day figure from Steve Murdock, a Rice University sociologist and former state demographer and past director of the census bureau. Murdock said by email that per bureau population estimates covering April 2010 through June 2013, Texas added nearly 1,100 people a day with more than half the increase due to births outnumbering deaths. Net migration into Texas from abroad and from other states, he said, accounted for a gain of 515 people a day; births exceeding deaths was responsible for 577 more people a day. Fifteen million additional Texans in 25 years Enough about the first part of this claim; do all the expected additional residents mean there will be 15 million additional residents 25 years from now, as the group says? After our first-pass interviews with Potter and Murdock, a Texas Future spokesman, David Polyansky, said by email the projection of 15 million additional Texans has appeared in state reports including a March 2011 report on transportation by an advisory panel to the Texas Department of Transportation. It refers to 15 million Texans \"projected to arrive over the next 25 years.\" We nudged Potter about that. He confirmed such a projection, but cautioned it\u2019s not expected to occur simply due to 1,000 new residents a day. Potter said the state\u2019s projections based on population growth from 2000 to 2010 indicate a potential addition of 15 million residents in about 25 years by assuming that as more people settle in, an escalating number of babies will be born. \"Thus the growth in our population projections is more geometric (or compounding) in nature,\" Potter wrote. In contrast, Potter said, simply adding 1,000 residents a day to the population (as the group\u2019s statement says) reflects \"arithmetic growth, which is substantially slower,\" meaning it would take nearly 39 years to gain 15 million additional residents by this factor alone, he said. Polyansky later agreed the average of 1,000 new Texans a day combines natural population growth as well as in-migration. The ad, he said, \"should be phrased differently,\" though it remains the case more people potentially puts more pressure on the highways. Our ruling Texas Future said: \"One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years.\" More than 1,000 people a day move to Texas, but at the same time hundreds leave. Still, the population grows by more than 1,000 a day, though that's mostly due to births outpacing deaths rather than Californians and other out-of-staters parking their Teslas. Another wrinkle: The state demographer agrees the population could grow by 15 million within about 25 years. But contrary to the group\u2019s message, reasons for the potential growth extend beyond the number of people that could flock here from elsewhere. On balance, we rate this claim as Half True. HALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

CLARIFICATION, 4:40 p.m., June 23, 2014: We revised our quotation of Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, to make it clear what he told us about the effects of net migration and there being more births than deaths in the state.

        "claim": "The UK has signed an agreement that says for every asylum seeker it sends to Rwanda, it will bring back one vulnerable refugee to the UK.",
        "doc": "A video on YouTube has claimed that the UK will accept as many refugees from Rwanda as asylum seekers that it sends there, as part of its asylum partnership arrangement with the country. Our readers have also asked us to look into this claim. The man in the video claims that \"Britain has signed an agreement that for every asylum seeker we fly to Rwanda, we will bring back one of those vulnerable refugees to our country in exchange. If we land 50 refugees of our own in Rwanda, then the plane will fly back to this country with 50 of the most vulnerable refugees from the Congo and Burundi.\" He therefore claims that the UK will not reduce the number of refugees and asylum seekers it has overall as a result of the policy. While the agreement between the UK and Rwanda does say that the countries will make arrangements \"to resettle a portion of Rwanda's most vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom\", it does not say that the number will be the same as the number of asylum seekers sent by the UK to Rwanda. The Home Office has also told Full Fact that this is \"absolutely not the case\". We do not yet know how many refugees the UK will resettle from Rwanda. In answer to a parliamentary question on 8 June 2022 , Baroness Williams said it would amount to \"a small number\". She also said: \"More details on the resettlement of vulnerable refugees will be set out in due course.\" Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What does the agreement with Rwanda say? The man in the video says his argument is based on the memorandum of understanding between the UK and Rwanda, signed in April 2022, a link to which he includes on the YouTube description. This agreement, which is not legally binding in international law, does say: \"The Participants will make arrangements for the United Kingdom to resettle a portion of Rwanda's most vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, recognising both Participants' commitment towards providing better international protection for refugees.\" But it doesn't give any more information on how many vulnerable refugees from Rwanda the UK will resettle. What is the government's Rwanda plan? The government is planning to send asylum seekers who arrived to the UK illegally to Rwanda, so their asylum claims can be considered there under Rwanda's domestic asylum system . Under this scheme, if successful, they will not return to the UK, but will have refugee status in Rwanda. If they are not successful, they may be removed from Rwanda . At the start of the video , the man claims: \"The idea is of course that 40 or 50 people whose request for asylum has not been accepted in Britain will be deported to the African country of Rwanda.\" This is misleading, because the people won't necessarily have had their asylum request rejected in the UK before being sent to Rwanda\u2014their asylum claims may not have been started in the UK. So while it's true that their requests have \"not been accepted\" here, that doesn't mean they've been rejected or started either. The Home Office says the arrangement will see \"those travelling to the UK through illegal, dangerous and unnecessary methods considered for relocation to Rwanda, where they will have their asylum claim processed\". It adds that \"every person who comes to the UK illegally [from 1 January 2022], or by dangerous or unnecessary methods from safe countries \u2013 including those arriving by small boats, hidden in the back of lorries and found in the UK without leave\" will be considered for relocation to Rwanda.

        "claim": "Television sets don't have a Channel 1 because that frequency had already been reserved for military use.",
        "doc": "One of the questions I posed to my father more than once during my inquisitive childhood was \u201cWhy don\u2019t television sets have a Channel 1?\u201d His answer was always \u201cBecause then everyone would want to be number one,\u201d a response I suspect reflected both that he didn\u2019t know the correct answer and that I was too young to understand it even if he did: Example: [Collected via e-mail, April 2008] When I was a child, I had heard that the reason there was no \u201cchannel one\u201d in the U.S. was because \u201cchannel one\u201d was a military frequency and wasn\u2019t accessible to the public. Almost no one I know that\u2019s my age or younger has ever even heard that rumor before \u2013 although a number of people my mom\u2019s age have told me they have vague recollections of hearing this rumor as well. The conundrum remained one of those eternal questions of childhood; later in life I vaguely learned that television sets didn\u2019t have a Channel 1 because the frequency had been assigned to some other use, but the details behind that circumstance remained murky. Now, older and wiser, I am finally in a position to demurkify the issue. Two important developments contributed to the mystery of the missing Channel 1: Between 1938 and 1948, several organizations \u2014 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA), and the National Television System Committee (NTSC) \u2014 wrestled with the issue of standards, with the result that television standards were set or revised four times during that period. The number of channels allocated to television use went from 19 (in 1938) to 18 (in 1940) to 13 (in 1946), and the frequencies assigned to those channels were also shifted around. After the penultimate round of standards revisions was enacted in 1946, television sales began to boom, but by 1948 one additional stumbling block remained to be cleared: Television was still sharing some of its frequencies with radio services. The FCC warned that interference problems were imminent if the situation was not resolved soon; the agency then followed up that warning by ruling that television could no longer share frequencies with radio services. The action necessary to settle the issue and completely separate radio and television frequencies was that the television industry would have to give up one more of its channels \u2014 the only question was which channel the television industry would choose to sacrifice. Amateur radio operators wanted to see television cleared off the frequency range currently assigned to Channel 2, but the television industry had other ideas. During the previous round of standards revisions, the FCC had decreed that Channel 1 could only be used as a community channel, and stations broadcasting on that channel were limited to a maximum power of 1,000 watts. Since those restrictions made Channel 1 the least useful of the thirteen channels currently allocated to the television industry, that was the channel they opted to give up. In 1948, Channel 1\u2019s frequencies were deleted from those allocated to television use and given over completely to radio services. The FCC opted not to renumber television\u2019s remaining twelve channels, so from that point onwards we were left with the familiar television (VHF) dial spanning Channels 2 to 13, with no Channel 1.",

        "claim": "COVID-19 vaccinations in the US have killed at least 125 children and injured 50,000.",
        "doc": "The US Food and Drug Administration has authorised that children as young as six months can receive COVID-19 vaccines, amid social media claims the jabs have killed 125 American kids and injured 50,000. Health experts say the claim is false, with no supporting evidence. They say the claim misuses data that is not intended to show a causal link between vaccines and a wide range of unverified adverse medical reactions. The data is from VAERS , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, established in 1990 as a way for people to report post-vaccination health issues that may be related to a vaccine. The claim is made by anti-vaccination website The Expose in an article headlined: \u201cUNFORGIVABLE \u2014 125 Children Dead, 1k Disabled & 50K injured due to Covid-19 Vaccination in the USA.\u201d It is being widely shared on Facebook and Twitter , notably in Papua New Guinea, where only about three per cent of the population is fully vaccinated . The article supports its claim with data tables produced by the VAERS system. AAP FactCheck replicated those data results by entering search parameters in the boxes provided by the system , but the figures The Expose used represent international reports of adverse events, not just the US. Selecting \u201cUS only\u201d results in a significantly lower number of reports. However, experts say the claim\u2019s main problem is the VAERS system does not demonstrate a causal link between the vaccines and the reports it collects. Therefore it is wrong to claim children have died as a result of the vaccines. An article on the academic website The Conversation in August 2021 highlighted how anti-vaccination groups can misuse the data. \u201cVAERS is ripe for exploitation because it relies on unverified self-reports of side effects. Anyone who received a vaccine can submit a report. And because this information is publicly available, misinterpretations of its data has been used to amplify COVID-19 misinformation through dubious social media channels and mass media,\u201d the authors wrote. US health experts have told AAP FactCheck this is the case with this latest claim. Mark Schleiss , professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said VAERS does not report certified adverse reactions to a vaccine. \u201cIndeed, although VAERS accepts and analyses reports of adverse events, it is not intended to prove a cause and effect relationship between a vaccine and an adverse reaction, but rather to detect potential early \u2018warning signals\u2019 of possible safety concerns,\u201d Prof Schleiss said in an email. \u201cThe anti-vaccine movement takes VAERS reports and provides intentionally misleading analyses which are not motivated by public health or concern for children but rather are driven by their political and financial agendas.\u201d Susan Ellenberg , emerita professor of biostatistics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, told AAP FactCheck VAERS data show only a temporal relationship between the vaccine and the event in question. \u201cMost reports to VAERS describe non-serious events, many of which likely are associated with the vaccine \u2013 fever, swelling at injection site, fatigue \u2013 these are known side effects of the vaccines but may still be reported to VAERS and will be counted,\u201d Dr Ellenberg said in an email. Prof Schleiss said he was unaware of any link between COVID-19 vaccination and death, hospitalisation or serious illness of children in the US. He said this was supported by the US FDA\u2019s review of effectiveness and safety of the Moderna vaccine in children aged six to 17 , and safety data from Pfizer on COVID-19 vaccine for use in children six months to four years \u2013 both published by the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) in the days before the child vaccination announcement on June 17. \u201cAs the VRBPAC tables (from the Moderna and Pfizer studies) show, there have been no attributable deaths to COVID vaccination of children,\u201d Prof Schleiss said. \u201cThere was a safety signal a year ago with myocarditis ; no deaths, no disability, complete recovery, and this has not been seen in young children.\u201d Dr Ellenberg said children with life-threatening illnesses would have received COVID vaccines and it was expected some deaths in this group occurred due to their underlying illness. \u201cWithout reviewing the reports (and likely obtaining more information about each case \u2013 the information in VAERS reports is minimal and unverified) it is impossible to assess the likelihood that any of the deaths could have been related to the vaccine. That\u2019s exactly what the CDC and the FDA scientists are doing.\u201d AAP FactCheck has previously highlighted abuses of VAERS data, such as here and here , while another fact-check of misuse of VAERS data can be seen here . A similar claim of children dying from the vaccine in the UK was debunked here . The Verdict The claim COVID-19 vaccines have killed 125 children in the US and injured more than 50,000 is false. Experts told AAP FactCheck that VAERS data is not intended to show a causal link between an adverse reaction and the vaccine, and anti-vaccination activists have misused the data to suit their agenda. Data published by US authorities suggests there have been no deaths or serious injury from COVID-19 vaccines among children. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.

Twitter user @ChaanchalMaurya posted (archive link) the viral image. It was retweeted over 5,000 times. Similarly, many Facebook and Twitter users have shared this image. FACT-CHECK Alt News performed a reverse image search on Yandex and found a YouTube video which carried the viral image. According to the video uploaded by Gracie Rosado in October 2014, the viral image was clicked by photographer Mark Edwards. After performing a keyword search, Alt News found the viral image on the website of Hard Rain Project, a charity founded by Edwards. The image was clicked by the photograher himself and it is described as, \u201cRefugees from East Pakistan arriving in India during the Bangladesh war in 1971. The book \u2018Body Horror: Photojournalism, Catastrophe and War\u2019 by John Taylor also attributes Edwards for this image. While speaking with the website Rare Historical Photos (RHP) in August 2014, Edwards said, \u201cI took this profoundly disturbing picture of a man carrying his cholera-stricken wife during the Bangladesh war in 1971. Ten million people crossed the East Pakistan (Bangladesh) border into India to escape the horrors of this bloody war.\u201d As per several online sources, Bangladesh witnessed an outbreak of cholera in 1971. Alt News reached out to Edwards over email for more details. He informed, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she died from cholera or not but there was absolutely no indication she was raped.\u201d The photograph is, therefore, circulating with baseless claims in the view of the recently-enacted Citizenship Amendment Act.

        "claim": "Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans \"choose to be poor, so it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy.\"",
        "doc": "A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, \"Paul Ryan: \u201822 million Americans choose to be poor, so it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy\u2019.\" Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senate\u2019s health care bill. \"What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy something they don\u2019t want, then they won't buy it,\" Ryan said. \"So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want.\" (We rated that Mostly False, because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox\u2019s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That\u2019s where the story turned to fiction. \"Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that\u2019s all there is to it,\" Ryan is quoted. \"So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they\u2019re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy.\" Ryan didn\u2019t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan\u2019s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as \"the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.\" The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isn\u2019t always obvious that\u2019s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true \u2014 especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senate\u2019s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim implies that the National Guard was not in Kenosha in August 2020 when Rittenhouse, then 17, shot three people, two of them fatally. But Gov. Tony Evers called in the National Guard on Aug. 24, and the guardsmen arrived the same day. The Rittenhouse shooting happened the following day, Aug. 25. The events that unfolded in Kenosha that summer began on Aug. 23, when Jacob Blake was shot in the back by a police officer who was trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. Blake was left paralyzed. He had been armed with a knife during the encounter, and the officer was not charged with a crime. A bystander\u2019s video of the shooting circulated widely and reignited protests that had blanketed the U.S. earlier in the year, after police brutality against other Black people such as George Floyd. Protesters poured into Kenosha, the New York Times reported. The day after the Blake shooting, protests grew violent, with more than 30 fires set and dozens of buildings destroyed. Evers activated the National Guard and 125 members arrived in Kenosha on the night of Aug. 24. On Aug. 25, Rittenhouse was invited by a friend to go to Kenosha to protect a car dealership during the protests. He has testified that he went to provide first aid. He was armed with an AR-15. That evening, just before midnight, Rittenhouse shot three people, killing two and wounding the third. He is charged with intentional homicide, reckless homicide and other crimes, and he has pleaded self-defense.

        "claim": "Kentucky Democratic state senator proposed satirical amendment in 2019 on women notifying state of pregnancies",
        "doc": "Users have been sharing a screenshot of a proposed amendment with claims that Kentucky passed a bill in June 2022 that would necessitate women of childbearing age to notify the state monthly with a signed statement from a medical professional as to whether they are pregnant. Although an amendment to that effect was introduced in 2019, it was proposed by a Democratic state senator and intended as satire in response to a bill that restricted abortion rights in the state. A section of the text has been circulating on social media that originated from the 2019 amendment that reads: \u201cAll women who are Kentucky residents, and of child bearing [sic] age, shall acquire a signed and notarized statement from a practitioner licensed pursuant to this chapter each month that states whether she is pregnant or not pregnant. If pregnant, the signed and notarized statement shall provide the status of the pregnancy.\u201d The proposed amendment further stated that if a woman were to be found pregnant by the medical professional, they would have to wear an ankle brace to ensure that they did not cross state lines to get an abortion. Users shared the screenshot of the proposed amendment in late June 2022 and claimed that the Kentucky House had passed a bill with the aforementioned amendment after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized a woman\u2019s right to abortion nationwide (here). One user who shared a screenshot on Twitter said: \u201cEnd of times is happening. Buckle up ladies, it\u2019s past time for another revolution\u201d (here). Another said: \u201cSo apparently this is making the rounds. Apparently it's a draft of a law that some are taking under consideration in KY. Roe was only the beginning\u201d (here). Other examples of the claim shared on social media can be seen (here), (here), (here). Although the amendment was indeed filed, it did not pass through the Kentucky state House (here). It was also filed by a Democrat in 2019, long before Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The proposed amendment was not a serious proposal, and instead was indented as satirical response to a bill that aimed to restrict access to abortion, the state senator who proposed the amendment at the time, state Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, told Reuters. Marzian told Reuters that she is pro-choice, and that she filed the amendment, \u201cin response to the horrid anti-choice bill filed by Rep. Joe Fischer,\u201d Marzian added. Local news outlets covered the proposed amendment in February 2019, including Spectrum News 1 and the Louisville Courier Journal (here), (here). The bill (HB148) Marzian referred to aimed to restrict abortion rights in Kentucky if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, and known as a \u201ctrigger law\u201d (here). Kentucky HB148 was passed in March 2019, with no such amendment viewable in the final copy of the bill (here), (here), (here). Marzian also proposed a satirical bill (HB396) in 2016 that would require men seeking drugs for erectile dysfunction to visit a doctor twice, get a note from their wives and swear on the Bible and promise to be faithful in their marriages (here), (here). The state senator introduced the bill days after Republican Governor Matt Bevin signed an informed consent law that requires women to consult with a doctor before having an abortion (here). HB396 was also covered by numerous outlets including the Louisville Courier Journal, The Guardian and MNSBC (here), (here), (here). There are 12 other U.S. states that have similar \u201ctrigger laws\u201d that are designed to heavily restrict or ban abortion following the Court\u2019s reversal, including Texas, Utah and Wyoming (here). On June 27, battles over access to abortion shifted to state courts, as judges blocked statewide bans in Louisiana and Utah and clinics in Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas sued seeking similar relief (here).",

        "claim": "In a letter in July 2020, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best told residents and business owners, \"We cannot enforce the law. You are on your own,\" or words to that effect.",
        "doc": "In the summer of 2020, amid nationwide protests over the death of a Black man in police custody, readers asked us to verify claims that Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best had told residents and business owners in that city, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law. You are on your own.\u201d On Twitter and in blog posts, those words were presented in quotation marks, indicating that they were a direct quotation from remarks made, or words written, by Best. Several other sources did not place quotation marks around the words, indicating that they constituted a summary of Best\u2019s comments, rather than a direct quotation. Seattle Police Department (SPD) confirmed for Snopes that the letter was authentic, and said it was posted to the website Nextdoor.com on July 24. The letter did not contain the words, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law. You are on your own.\u201d As such, online posts that placed quotation marks around those words misled readers by presenting them as if they were a direct quotation. Those words were also not a fair or reasonable summary of the statements made in the letter. The background to the letter was Ordinance 126102, which was passed by Seattle City Council on June 15, filed by the Seattle City Clerk on June 26, and was scheduled to come into force on July 26. (Best\u2019s letter incorrectly identified the legislation as \u201cCity Council Ordinance 119805\u201d \u2014 it was introduced as Council Bill 119805 but filed as Ordinance 126102). That legislation banned the use or possession by any city department, including SPD, of \u201ccrowd control weapons,\u201d defined as: \u201ckinetic impact projectiles, chemical irritants, acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, water cannons, disorientation devices, ultrasonic cannons, or any other device that is designed to be used on multiple individuals for crowd control and is designed to cause pain or discomfort.\u201d Hence Best\u2019s assertion, in her letter, that \u201cThis ordinance bans Seattle Police officers [from] the use of less lethal tools, including pepper spray that is commonly used to disperse crowds that have turned violent.\u201d Best added: \u201cSimply put, the legislation gives officers NO ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.\u201d That is a much more specific and narrowly focused assertion than, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law.\u201d There are many areas of policing and law enforcement that SPD, like countless other local police forces around the country, address on a daily basis. Crowd control is just one such area. While some observers might have been alarmed by Best\u2019s warning to residents that Ordinance 126102 would substantially hamstring her officers\u2019 capacity to police a large, unruly protest, it was a misrepresentation to summarize her warning as, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law.\u201d Similarly, Best also did not write words to the effect that Seattle residents were \u201con their own.\u201d Her letter began by saying that SPD was \u201ccommitted to addressing life safety incidents and calls for service, and responding to ongoing demonstrations and unrest in the city.\u201d Best did not say that officers would not deal with incidents during protests, but did warn residents that her department would have an \u201cadjusted deployment in response to any demonstrations this weekend \u2026\u201d Best therefore indicated there were certain, specific kinds of disorder and breaches of the law that she anticipated her officers\u2019 would be limited in combating, but she did not say, or imply, that SPD \u201ccannot enforce the law.\u201d Best and SPD have consistently opposed the provisions of Ordinance 126102, and on July 25 the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted an application by the U.S. Justice Department for a temporary restraining order, which prevented Ordinance 126102 from coming into force that weekend. In a statement published later that day, Best advised Seattle residents that \u201c\u2026 SPD officers will be carrying pepper spray and blast balls today, as would be typical for events that carry potential to include violence \u2026\u201d In a separate but related court case, Black Lives Matter activists in and around Seattle have sued the city and the police department for, in brief, allegedly using excessive force and violating the First Amendment rights of those taking part in protests against racial injustice and police brutality in the city, which have taken place throughout the summer. In June, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones issued a temporary restraining order against the city, prohibiting SPD from \u201cemploying chemical irritants or projectiles of any kind against persons peacefully engaging in protests or demonstrations.\u201d However, the order allowed exceptions in cases where police officers take \u201cnecessary, reasonable, proportional, and targeted action to protect against a specific imminent threat of physical harm to themselves or identifiable others or to respond to specific acts of violence or destruction of property.\u201d The order was later extended and is scheduled to remain in place until Sept. 30. In clashes with some protesters on July 25, SPD deployed pepper spray, blast balls, and sponge grenades. Black Lives Matter activists have alleged that those actions amounted to a violation of Jones\u2019 restraining order, and two days later the activists filed a motion alleging contempt of court against the city and its police force, claiming that on July 25, \u201cSPD suddenly and without warning divided the protesters into two groups and began an all-out assault. SPD officers lobbed flash-bang grenades, blast balls filled with pepper spray, and foam tipped bullets into the middle of retreating crowds.\u201d For its part, SPD said the protests descended into a \u201criot\u201d at one point, with an explosion causing damage to the East Police Precinct building and 59 officers injured over the course of the day.",

        "doc": "A vintage photograph of two men astride Harley-Davidson motorcycles is frequently shared online along with the claim that the men pictured are the company\u2019s founders, William Harley and ArthurDavidson, and that the imagecaptures the unveiling of their first motorcycles in 1914: Although the photograph is a genuine one dating from that time period, the backstory commonly attached to it is not. This image first appeared online when it was posted to a web site dedicated to old photographs of Harley-Davidson motorcycles by Ross Hollibaugh. While Hollibaugh wasn\u2019t completely certain about the image\u2019s origins, he claimed that it showed two of his relatives posing at a Harley-Davidson dealership in Minnesota, not the titular founders of Harley-Davidson: \u201cI was enjoying your page with all the old Harleys and remembered that I have a photo of my cousin\u2019s grandfather and his grandfather\u2019s brother each sitting on the brand new 1914 Harleys that they purchased in 1914. I am not sure, but I believe the photo may have been taken at the dealership (probably not really a dealership back then, but the guy must have been an HD distributer) in Wanamingo, MN. Wanamingo is 6 miles from Zumbrota. I still have family in both Wanamingo and Zumbrota. My cousin still has the original receipt for his grandfather\u2019s bike and he scanned a copy of it for me. You can see on the invoice that Lars Johnson of Zumbrota, MN purchased his bike for $245 and only put $10 cash down. Lars was my cousin\u2019s (Steve Johnson) grandfather.\u201d The provenance of the photograph aside, a picture taken in 1914 couldn\u2019t capture William Harley and Arthur Davidson (who were both 33 years old by then) unveiling their first motorcycle, as the initial production Harley-Davidson motorcycle had come out in1903, and the first Harley-Davidson dealership had been opened a year later. By 1914, Harley-Davidson had entered the world of motorcycle racing. We weren\u2019t able to locate a comparable imageof Harley and Davidson on motorcycles in 1914, but a photograph of them taken in 1924 clearly shows that the two men seen in the 1914 photograph displayed above are not the famous founders of Harley-Davidson: ",

        "doc": "The misleading claim was published on Facebook here in early April 2020. The post's traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPeople who are dining out have to be aware!/ You will get a fine of $2000 if you remove your masks before the food arrives at your table./ The same case applies if you did not wear your masks after you finished your food./ This morning a waitress from Cafe de Coral said the restaurant had received 4000 fines already yesterday, each customer received a fine of HKD2000 because they sat on the restricted seats./ She is very worried, kept on reminding customers not to sit at the wrong seats and sit properly to prevent crossing the line./ She said the fine is really serious, $2000 per person./ And the government even dispatched plain-clothes police officers with pre-printed tickets./ All violators will receive the $2000 fine if they remove their masks before the food arrives.\u201d Caf\u00e9 de Coral is a Hong Kong restaurant chain. A similar claim was shared on Facebook here, here, here; on Twitter here; and on various online forums here and here. It was also published beside a photo of a purported HKD$2,000 fine on Facebook here and here. The claim, however, is false. Restaurant denial Caf\u00e9 de Coral Group refuted the claim in the misleading posts. \u201cCaf\u00e9 de Coral Group hereby clarifies that the rumour on the Internet about 4000 fines for no masks at Caf\u00e9 de Coral restaurants during the pandemic was untrue,\u201d a restaurant spokesperson told AFP by email on July 20, 2020. The Hong Kong Government also denied the claim about diners receiving a HKD$2,000 fine for failing to wear masks inside restaurants. \u201cThe penalty fine of HKD$2000 only applies to the Prevention and Control of Disease (Prohibition on Group Gathering) Regulation (Cap. 599G), which exempted group gatherings of more than four people,\u201d the government said in a traditional-Chinese statement on its official information Facebook page here on April 5. In response to the misleading post in July 2020, Hong Kong\u2019s Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) shared an official government press release, which stated that \u201cpersons who participate in a prohibited group gathering may discharge liability for the offence by paying a fixed penalty of $2,000.\u201d As part of stricter social distancing measures announced on July 13, the Hong Kong government announced that people failing to wear face masks on public transport could face a fine of up to HKD$5,000. The measures came into effect at midnight on July 15, it said. Miscaptioned photos An examination of the photo of the uniformed man reveals that he is wearing the uniform of the Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department -- not a police officer\u2019s uniform. Below is a comparison between the photo in the misleading post (L) and a photo of uniformed Food and Environmental Hygiene Department officers from an official agency press release (R): The photo of the purported HKD$2,000 fine shows a ticket for a violation of the social distancing rule. It mandates no more than four people can be seated at the same table. Below is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts that featured a ticket with the violation details circled in red: AFP could not verify whether the image of the FEHD officer was connected to the image of the purported fine. The false claim was also debunked by Hong Kong fact-checker Kauyim here.",

        "claim": "Gay Canadian filmmaker Chris Ball was severely beaten and bloodied by emboldened Donald Trump supporters shortly after the 2016 election.",
        "doc": "After the 2016 U.S. general election wound down,stories of a more dangerous United Statesbegan popping up on social media. According to one such story, gay Canadian film producerChris Ballwas badly beaten outside a bar in Santa Monica, California, by several Donald Trump supporters who had beenemboldened by the vote\u2019s outcome. The web site USUncut reported on the claim and shared moderately graphic Facebook screenshots documenting the aftermath of the purported attack: Trump supporters shouted slurs at a gay man from Canada who was in a Santa Monica, CA bar Tuesday night watching Trump win the Presidential election, and upon leaving the bar, the man says, these supporters attacked him. Calgary filmmaker Chris Ball said that he was watching the election results when supporters of the Republican candidate began to lob epithets. \u2018We got a new president you fucking faggots,\u201d they said, Ball told Metro Calgary. When Ball left the bar alone later in the night, Trump supporters followed him to an alley way and assaulted him, Ball said. The last thing he remembers before awaking bloody on the pavement was having a beer bottle smashed over his head. Friends took him to the hospital. According to that article, the incident took place on 8 November 2016, the night of the election. The next day, Facebookuser K.C. MacPherson shared one of the images and wrote: My good friend, Chris Ball, was bottled in the face by a celebratory Trump supporter \u2014 because he is gay. I try hard to understand different points of views, perspectives, and avenues when it comes to politics, but when the realities of the time we live in are so stark it really breaks my heart. This is real, and the mentalities and mindsets behind it are very real as well. This hatred, bigotry, and senseless violence all comes from the same part of America that voted in a demagogue who spits hatred as his rhetoric. This isn\u2019t where the world needs to be heading, this isn\u2019t what we should be seeing in the world. It\u2019s 2016. We\u2019re all equal, and all deserve the respect to live our lives how we choose. I hope this isn\u2019t a sign of where we\u2019re going as people. Please take the time to reflect on what is going on in the world, and the things you can do to keep the world free of hate \u2013 hate that is becoming all too common now of days. Little information was provided about the circumstances leading up to the bar fight, although earlier reporting quoted Ball as saying the images made his injuries seem worse than they actually were: Calgarian Chris Ball was left with five staples in his head from the hospital \u2014 but he said the bloody picture makes it look worse than it really was. Ball spent the evening in a Santa Monica, Calif. bar watching poll results come in. As the election progressed, he said attitudes in the bar became more and more heated \u2014 on both sides of the campaign. \u201cPeople started launching homophobic slurs at me from afar,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I kind of got into it, but I didn\u2019t want to provoke them.\u201d They were saying things like, \u2018We got a new president you f\u2013king faggots.\u2019 When he later left the bar, alone, he was walking through an alley when he was jumped by a group of men \u2014 one of which smashed a bottle over his head \u2026 He fell back, his head smashing against the concrete, where he blacked out. \u201cWhen I came to, I remember waking up and wiping the blood from my eyes. I called some friends, they picked me up and I went right to the hospital,\u201d he recalled \u2026 In retrospect, Ball doesn\u2019t think it was really a political issue \u2014 it was a hate issue, fuelled by the charged atmosphere of the election night, with a group of drunk people who used Trump\u2019s rhetoric as an excuse to get in a fight. That account provided a version of eventsthat was not so clearlypartisan, with bar patrons engaging, as they sometimes do, in heated rhetoric. Ball said he left the establishment alone and claims he was jumped by a group of men, but not necessarily anyone who had followed him outside from the bar. It ispossible that the men who purportedly attacked Chris Ball were Trump supporters emboldened by the candidate\u2019s win. However, Trump supporters might point to images captured just beforethe election as counter-evidence: On 10 November 2016, the Santa Monica Police Department published a post to their Facebook page casting further doubt on Ball\u2019s story: SANTA MONICA POLICE DEPARTMENT ADVISORY: You may have seen an unconfirmed story regarding a possible hate crime incident involving a \u201cChris Ball\u201d alleging he was assaulted in Santa Monica on election night, November 8, by \u201cTrump Supporters\u201d. The Santa Monica Police Department and the City of Santa Monica have not received any information indicating this crime occurred in the City of Santa Monica. We encourage the alleged victim to come forward and work with us if a crime did in fact take place. A check of local hospitals revealed there was no victim of any such incident admitted or treated as well. If you have any questions, please contact Public Information Officer, Lt. Saul Rodriguez, (310) 458-2293. None of the reports we found about Chris Ball\u2019s altercation with purported Trump supporters mentioned a location, cited a police report, or any provided information substantiating his attackers\u2019 motives. The account could have been completely accurate, but the event it described also could have been a garden-variety bar fight that took place after what turned out to be an exceptionally tense night in the United States.",

        "claim": "Says a Senate resolution would restore $140 in monthly general assistance payments and prevent people from committing crime.",
        "doc": "During a July 11 debate about overriding a veto handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, state Sen. Sandra Cunningham made an impassioned speech about the consequences of eliminating monthly general assistance payments to New Jersey residents in need.The Hudson County Democrat was pushing to restore the $19.5 million that Christie cut from the state budget for the general assistance program. A part of the state\u2019s welfare reform program, the general assistance program serves single persons and married couples without children.Cunningham, one of the sponsors of a resolution for that funding, strongly implied that the state budget for fiscal year 2012 cut the $140 monthly payments and that her resolution would restore that amount. She argued that taking away that money would lead individuals to turn to crime.The problem is that those monthly payments were no longer in jeopardy.PolitiFact New Jersey found that Cunningham was wrong to suggest the monthly payments were going down. In fact, the final state budget maintains general assistance payments at their previous levels.First, let\u2019s look at how Cunningham made her case.\"I know when you look at it, you say, \u2018It\u2019s $140 per month. What good does it do?\u2019 A hundred-forty dollars per month, if you don\u2019t have a job, if you are trying to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach, is a great deal of money,\" Cunningham told her colleagues. \"It\u2019s absolutely necessary.\"If we don\u2019t help these people, these people will find a way to help themselves,\" Cunningham continued. \"When we talk about urban area, and when we talk about impoverished people, we talk a lot about crime. Well, crime and poverty go together.\"Cunningham went on, \"And in this particular case, if these people cannot find, cannot have something to eat, they will take to the streets and they will commit a crime. They will do that.\"Before concluding her speech, Cunningham pleaded with her fellow senators: \"Please think about how some of our people really need it and how some of our people in this state are forced to live. Please vote for this resolution.\"The resolution to provide that funding failed in a 24-15 vote.Now, let\u2019s explain the general assistance payments.In fiscal year 2011, the general assistance program provided monthly benefits of $140 and $210 for recipients deemed \"employable\" and \"unemployable,\" respectively.The fiscal year 2012 budget proposed by Gov. Chris Christie included language to cut monthly benefits by $15. But the Legislature threw out that language when it approved the budget and Christie could not add it back in.David Rosen, legislative budget and finance officer for the state\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that removing that language from the governor\u2019s proposed budget maintained the monthly benefit levels and the governor could not restore that language.Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the monthly benefits will remain unchanged in fiscal year 2012 because that language was eliminated.State funding for the general assistance program remains slightly below the fiscal year 2011 level, but that\u2019s due to other program changes, Brossoie said. Of Cunningham\u2019s resolution, Brossoie said, \"No change would have been made to cash benefits.\"So, let\u2019s be clear: Cunningham urged her colleagues to maintain $140 monthly payments that were not being cut.Cunningham told PolitiFact New Jersey that at the time she made the statement she believed the Senate resolution would restore the $15 cut to monthly payments. She later acknowledged that the monthly benefits have been restored to their prior levels, but declined to comment further.But what about Cunningham\u2019s claim that losing general assistance payments could drive some recipients to commit crimes?Two experts said general assistance payments won\u2019t necessarily prevent crime.\"There is certainly a link between poverty and crime, but it\u2019s not so simple that a small payment would fix it,\" said John Roman, executive director of the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute.The rulingCunningham strongly implied the state budget cut monthly general assistance payments, but the budget actually kept those payments intact. The senator also said losing that money could lead to more crime, but two experts said the payments wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent criminal acts.Cunningham acknowledged the monthly benefits were restored, but it is still ridiculous for her to claim people will commit crime in response to losing general assistance payments, when those payments aren\u2019t changing at all.We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

        "claim": "\"As long as I have served . . . This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators.\"",
        "doc": "In case you haven't heard, the traditionally blue state of Massachusetts just elected Republican Scott Brown to take the seat of the late Edward Kennedy, a standard-bearer for the the Democratic Party. A lot of ink has been been dedicated to what this means for Democrats in the midterm elections, the party's strength and, of course, the health care reform plan in the Senate. The upper chamber needs 60 votes to prevent a Republican filibuster on the bill, and with Brown's election, Democrats have lost their supermajority. Vice President Joe Biden lamented this obstacle in a speech just days before Brown defeated Democratic Senate candidate Martha Coakley. \"As long as I have served \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen, as my uncle once said, the Constitution stood on its head as they\u2019ve done,\" Biden said at a Florida fundraiser Jan. 17, 2010, according to a White House pool report. \"This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators.\" We're going to check the second part of Biden's statement, that this is the first time in his political career that every decision in the Senate has required 60 votes. But first, some Senate history. Once upon a time, senators could stall debate indefinitely by reading from cookbooks or reciting Shakespeare (think Jimmy Stewart's impassioned speech in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). In 1917, new rules allowed Senate leadership to end debate so long as it had support from two-thirds of the Senate. In 1975, the Senate reduced that to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 senators. Around this time, the old-school filibuster started to become less popular. With only 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster, the majority party would simply file cloture motions -- the technical term to set up a vote to stop debate -- and get on with it, said Senate historian Don Ritchie. Of course, both the minority and the majority have benefited from the tactical tool. The minority can unify and oppose a cloture motion, effectively stalling a bill. And the majority, knowing it has no chance of winning on a vote, can file a cloture motion and then blame the opposition for holding things up. But back to Biden's statement. He won his Senate seat in 1973, just two years before the Senate adopted its new cloture rules, and served until Jan. 15, 2009, shortly before he was sworn in as vice president. The Senate historian's office provided us with a list of cloture votes since 1919, which have been on the uptick in the last three decades. The 110th Congress, which spanned from 2006 to 2008, boasts the most with 112 votes. There were 54 such votes from 2004 to 2006, and 49 vote from 2002 to 2004. There have been 39 cloture votes so far this session, which has been under way since January 2009. Is the increasing use of cloture an example of pure obstructionist politics, as Biden's statement would imply? It's more complicated than that, said Ritchie. In the early '70s, when Biden first came to the Senate, the membership of both the Democratic and Republicans parties were more ideologically diverse and, as a result, party-line votes were scarce, Ritchie said. \"In the late '80s, the two parties became more internally coherent and cohesive,\" he said. \"As a result, leadership was invoking cloture a lot more.\" This dynamic has come to a head in recent years when the Senate leadership, whether Republican or Democratic, has had such narrow majorities, Ritchie said. The minority is more likely to unify against legislation, effectively filibustering a bill. As a result, the majority is essentially forced to round up 60 votes to keep the process going. Sarah Binder, a congressional expert teaching at George Washington University and a fellow with the Brookings Institution, echoed Ritchie. In the early 1970s, senators \"were less likely to vote with fellow partisans, so there was a less partisan use of cloture,\" she said. \"Today, there's no ideological overlap between the parties.\" Binder also pointed out that the size and scope of the leadership's agendas has grown dramatically in recent years, but it has little time to get big things done. Invoking the 60-vote rule is one way to keep the agenda moving. Back to Biden: His overall point -- that the Senate more frequently requires 60 votes to get things done these days -- has some truth to it. According to Senate experts, there have been more and more cloture votes as the upper chamber becomes increasingly split along party lines. But he said \"every single solitary decision has required 60 senators,\" which is an exaggeration. In 2009, for example, there were 397 roll call votes. According to the Senate Historian's office, only 39 of them were cloture votes. Indeed, we found plenty of major bills that did not require 60 votes to start or end debate, including a bill meant to give more children health insurance and a bill to prevent mortgage foreclosures. Furthermore, the Senate frequently passes noncontroversial bills unanimously, so there are countless pieces of legislation such as post office namings and resolutions that don't require 60 votes. As we like to say at PolitiFact, words matter; if Biden had said every \"major\" decision requires 60 votes, he would have been on more solid ground. As a result, we rate his claim False.",

        "doc": "It was December 1975 when Bruce Springsteen took his \"Born to Run\" tour to Walsh gym at Seton Hall University, kicking off the set with \"Thunder Road\" and \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.\"And in the audience was the future governor of New Jersey, seeing the Boss for the first of what would ultimately reach 130 concerts.Gov. Chris Christie pointed to that show as his first Springsteen concert during an interview Wednesday on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\" The Republican governor would have been 13 years old at the time of the concert.His first show was \"at Seton Hall University in South Orange at Walsh gym\" in 1975, Christie told Fallon, before the two performed part of \"Thunder Road\" together.Taking a break from politics, PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that Christie knows his Springsteen concert history.Springsteen performed at the Walsh gym at Seton Hall University on Dec. 11, 1975, according to various websites containing information on the set list as well as images of a concert ticket, an advertisement in a student newspaper; and CD covers.The concert was scheduled to start at 8:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, with tickets costing $6.50 in advance and $7.50 at the door, according to the advertisement posted here.Springsteen performed the following 21 songs that night, according to various websites:1) Thunder Road2) Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out3) Spirit in the Night4) Lost in the Flood5) She's the One6) Born to Run7) Pretty Flamingo8) Growin' Up9) It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City10) Backstreets11) Kitty's Back12) Jungleland13) Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)14) 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)15) Santa Claus Is Coming to Town16) Detroit Medley17) For You18) Party Lights19) Quarter to Three20) Wear My Ring Around Your Neck21) Twist and ShoutA person who attended the concert posted a photo of Springsteen and the band here.

        "claim": "\u201cBiden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.\u201d",
        "doc": "The 117th Congress has been focused on the second impeachment of former President Donald Trump and a COVID-19 relief package. It hasn\u2019t yet approved any tax bills for President Joe Biden to sign. Yet a post widely shared on Facebook stated: \"Biden signs 45% Capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim raises issues related to two different taxes that Biden has proposed changing: the capital gains tax, which is applied to the profits from sales of assets such as stocks; and the estate tax, which is applied to assets after their owner dies and can reduce the size of an inheritance. But the proposed changes haven\u2019t been enacted. \"These are just campaign proposals. Nothing's been passed, nothing\u2019s been signed,\" said Robert McClelland, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center. A capital gain is the difference between what someone paid for an asset, also known as the \"basis,\" and what they sold it for. The tax rates for capital gains vary based on income and how long the asset was owned. Rates are more favorable for assets that are held for more than a year, and some gains on home sales are exempt from taxes. In the presidential campaign, Biden proposed raising the top long-term capital gains rate to 39.6% from 20%. This increase would apply only to people earning more than $1 million per year. When it comes to inheritances, the vast majority of estates do not pay the estate tax; it kicks in only for larger estates. The current 40% estate tax rate applies only to individual estates larger than $11.58 million, and only to the assets above that amount (the threshold is $23.16 million for married couples). That is, the first $11.58 million of an estate is exempt from federal estate taxes. The exemption is that high largely because the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the exemption in 2018 and indexed it to inflation after 2018. However, that provision is set to expire in 2025. After that, the exemption would revert to $5 million, unless the law is changed. Candidate Biden proposed raising the rate to 45% and reducing the exemption to $3.5 million. So, the change would affect more estates and subject them to higher taxes. Based on the estimated 2.81 million people who will die in 2022, about 2,600 estates, or 0.09%, would be taxable under current law, the Tax Policy Center estimates. If the exemption were reduced to $3.5 million, about 16,600 estates, or 0.59%, would be taxable. Biden also proposed another change that\u2019s related to both capital gains and inheritances. It involves a current tax policy called \"stepped-up basis.\" Stepped-up basis provides a big benefit to those who inherit certain assets, including real estate, that has appreciated in value over time. It resets the cost basis for an asset to its fair-market value when the owner died. So under stepped-up basis, a person who inherits an asset and then sells it for a profit has to pay a capital gains tax on its gains in value only from the date of the estate owner\u2019s death, rather than from the time it was originally purchased. Biden proposed eliminating stepped-up basis, so that the tax would apply on the asset\u2019s full gain in value since purchase. It\u2019s possible any proposal might apply only to those making $400,000, in keeping with his pledge not to raise taxes on people making less than that. A widely shared Facebook post stated: \"Biden signs 45% capital gains tax. Kiss your inheritance goodbye.\" Biden has proposed changes that would increase capital gains and estate tax rates, and expand the reach of both taxes. But Congress has not passed any of those changes, and thus no such bill has been signed by Biden. We rate the statement False.",

FACT CHECK NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found that the video is old and not related to the ongoing polls in Uttar Pradesh.

This directed us to a Facebook post uploaded on April 11, 2019, that carried the same viral video claiming to expose voting fraud in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Muzaffarnagar. We further conducted a keyword search for BSP candidate Shaila Khan and found a news report published on November 3, 2017, stating that BSP candidate Shaila was contesting for the post of Rampur Nagar Palika chairperson. Taking a cue from this, we searched further and found the viral video uploaded on Facebook on November 28, 2017 stating, \u201cRampur\u2019s BSP candidate Shaila Khan caught 4 women while casting their vote with a forged Aadhar card.\u201d We searched more about Shaila Khan and found news reports and videos that featured Khan as the BSP candidate. We also found one interview in which she talked about the viral video and voter fraud. Although we could not independently ascertain the date and location of the viral video, it is evident from the above information that the viral video dates back to 2017 and is not related to the ongoing Uttar Pradesh elections.

        "claim": "\"In fact, if you add up the net wealth of his cabinet, it has more wealth than a third of the American people total -- close to 100 million people.\"",
        "doc": "President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \"drain the swamp\" was not convincing to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who illustratedhis criticism with Trump\u2019s billionaire cabinet, which \"has more wealth than a third of the American people total -- close to a 100 million people.\" That seems like a large share of wealth in cabinet member\u2019s pockets. But is Schumer right? He is, although his comparison is disputed among economists because so many Americans have a low net worth. Schumer specifically talks about the \"net wealth\" of cabinet members. Net wealth is how much a person\u2019s assets are worth once you have subtracted liabilities, like mortgage or credit card debt. If a person has high debt that exceeds their assets, their net wealth is negative. It is impossible to calculate the exact net wealth of Trump\u2019s cabinet, because the members are only required to indicate a range while filling out their financial disclosure forms, such as \"between $15,001 and $50,000\". The ranges can vary by up to 25 million. That is a pretty vague indication. Schumer\u2019s office cited an article from December by the website Quartz that evaluated the wealth of 17 of Trump\u2019s cabinet members to be more than $9.5 billion. Other news media, like the NBC News estimated it to be as high as $14.5 billion. We looked at data provided by OpenSecrets and publicly available financial disclosure forms and found a much lower number: $3.5 billion, not including assets of spouses. Due to a lack of information, we could not add Sonny Perdue, the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture, and Alexander Acosta, Trump\u2019s nominee for Secretary of Labor, to that number. However, it would not have made a big difference. It also doesn\u2019t really matter how rich Trump\u2019s cabinet members exactly are. According to the Federal Reserve, a U.S. household had an average net wealth of $46,700 in 2013, which are the most recent numbers available. However, the bulk of wealth in the United States is owned by the top 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bottom half only holds 1 percent of U.S. wealth distribution. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2011 the bottom quintile of Americans had a negative net wealth of -$6,029 and the second quintile had a net wealth of $7,263. This is compared to a large difference with the third quintile: $68,839 in 2011. The number keeps rising exponentially for the fourth quintile who own $205,985 and the highest quintile who owned $630,754. \"The bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing,\" says Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of Berkeley. That is because some either have a very low or even negative net wealth, due to high debt. For that matter, it does not take a lot to \"have more wealth than a third of the American people,\" like Schumer claimed, Zuchman added. So even if Trump\u2019s cabinet were all people from the middle class, Schumer\u2019s statement would still be accurate. Our ruling Schumer said that Trump\u2019s cabinet had more net wealth than a third of the American people. He bases his claims on an estimate of $9.5 billion of net wealth for the cabinet. Economists familiar with those kinds of comparison told us that Schumer got his numbers right. But they also told us that there needs to be clarification on the meaningfulness of Schumer\u2019s statement, since it doesn\u2019t take billions of dollars to be richer than the bottom third of of the United States. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

        "doc": "A Facebook post blasts Hillary Clinton and praises President Donald Trump in contrasting how Clinton responded to an attack on Americans in Libya in 2012 with how Trump responded to the storming of the U.S. embassy in Iraq. The claim, posted Jan. 1, the day after the Iraqi embassy was stormed, says: \"Hillary ignored multiple requests for security, didn\u2019t respond for 13 hours, & let 4 Americans die in Benghazi. Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad. That\u2019s the difference between a traitor & a leader.\" The post is wrong in its assertions about Clinton, who was secretary of state during the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. The only element of truth in this comparison is that Trump did rush in military reinforcements. The Benghazi attacks killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. It\u2019s true that the State Department did not honor requests for more security prior to the attacks, but there was no evidence that Clinton was made aware of those requests. As for Clinton\u2019s response, none of the many congressional investigations about the attacks asserted (as Trump did) that she was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred. Moreover, it was not Clinton\u2019s responsibility to send troops to the scene \u2014 the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Several investigations found that no action by Clinton, or anybody in the administration, could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. The terrorist attacks were much more violent than the storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. As Time magazine reported, protesters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound shouting \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" and smashed through a main door, set a reception area on fire, and covered the embassy wall with militia flags and anti-U.S. graffiti. The same day, Dec. 31, U.S. marines deployed to Iraq. The next day, Trump deployed more troops to the Middle East. Trump blamed Iran for the attack and issued a threat. \"Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 31: \"They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy new year!\" A Facebook post attacked Clinton, claiming: \"Hillary ignored multiple requests for security, didn\u2019t respond for 13 hours, & let 4 Americans die in Benghazi. Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad.\" There was no evidence that Clinton ignored requests for more security before the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in attacks in Benghazi in 2012. It was the military\u2019s responsibility, not Clinton\u2019s, to respond; and several investigations concluded that no one in the administration could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. Meanwhile, in a much different situation, Trump did rush military reinforcements after the storming of the U.S. embassy in Iraq. He threatened to hold Iran responsible, but did not threaten its destruction. We rate the statement Mostly False.",

Per a July 9, 2023, Facebook post from the company's verified account, Burger King Thailand admitted that this was \"Not for fun, this is for real!\" and that the bun carried \"up to 20 slices of American cheese!!!\" According to The New York Times, the company said the burger would only be available until July 13, 2023. However, the report stated that it was still available on the website on July 14, and an employee at one branch said it would be on its menu until July 20. As of this writing, the burger is no longer available on Burger King Thailand'swebsite. Coconuts Bangkok, a Thai media company, published a review of the burger on their website. Nicky Tanskul, the brave soul who tried the burger wrote: How does it taste? Pretty awful. It was the driest burger I've ever tasted because there was no sauce and no meat patty. I felt a bit sick to my stomach at the amount of processed cheese I was consuming. No human should ever eat this much dyed yellow cheese at once. I mustered for another two bites. I think I'm blind. No more please. Customers posted videos of the cheeseburger on TikTok: The burger cost 109 Thai baht, which amounted to 3.15 U.S. dollars.Chayoot Wana, an economist and professor, told The New York Times that the individual cheese slices in the burger amounted to 5 baht, or 14 cents, per slice. This made the burger cheaper than a cheese packet bought in a Thai store. \"I might consider buying that burger and keeping the cheese slices,\" he said. \"It would be a better value for the money, and I could make more dishes.\" Given that The Real Cheeseburger was widely reported on, and its existence was acknowledged by Burger King Thailand, we rate this claim as True.",

        "claim": "Says that under the Obamacare law, health insurance \"premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since\" 2013.",
        "doc": "John Cornyn of Texasaccurately told a Texas constituent that residents of a third of U.S. counties are down to a single choice of insurance plans under the Obamacare law that Republicans vow to repeal. PolitiFact this year rated True a similar claim. According to a 2016 analysis, people trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only had one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation\u2019s counties. Some 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people, could pick from a single insurance provider. But a Houston resident asked us to check another part of Cornyn\u2019s September 2017 email to her, in which he said: \"Under the Affordable Care Act (P. L. 111-148), premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since\" 2013. We decided to put that declaredincrease to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. This claim, we found, stems from a reputablereport, though the percentage cited by Cornyn merits explanatory clarifications. Cornyn cites HHS report At our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie traced the 105-percent figure to a five-page May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that average premiums charged in 2017 for health insurance policies sold to individuals shopping for coverage on the online federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, were 105 percent higher \"than average individual market premiums in 2013.\" The report further says: \"The median state percent increase was 108%. The results are similar with those published by online health insurance broker eHealth, which found a 99% increase in premiums for plans purchased on their portal between 2013 and 2017.\" See the undated eHealth state-by-state chart here. Nationally, the HHS report says, average \"monthly premiums increased from $232 in 2013 to $476 in 2017 and 62% of those states had 2017 exchange premiums at least double the 2013 average.\" A chart in the report shows variations by state ranging from a low of 12 percent (New Jersey) to a high of 222 percent (Alabama). For Texas, the 2017 average premium for individual coverage purchased through the exchange, $404, was costing 82 percent more than the $222 market average price in the state in 2013 for an individual policy, the chart says. Report comes with conditions Experts we reached agreed premiums in 2017 were up quite a bit from 2013. They also noted contrasts to take into consideration. Michael Tanner, who studies health care reform for the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called HHS\u2019s reported percentage and other escalation estimates \"in the ballpark.\" By phone, Tanner went on: \"To try to pin it down to an exact percentage, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t (calculate) those numbers.\" The Cornyn-cited HHS report itself offers clarifications, including: --A reminder that the Obamacare law imposed coverage expectations not fully in place until 2014. \"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced many new regulations in the market for individual health insurance,\" the report says. \"These included a number of changes to the types of insurance products that could be offered and the rules insurers could use to vary prices based on customer risk,\" a reference to the Obamacare law\u2019s mandate that insurers cover pre-existing conditions without imposing additional purchaser costs. \"In most states,\" the report says, \"these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans all else equal.\" --\"This analysis,\" the report says, \"does not account for the fact that the overall populations enrolling in the individual market in 2017 are different from those enrolling in 2013. Older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool now than in 2013. The changing mix of enrollees and adverse selection pressure has likely been a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market over this four-year period,\" the report says. --The research didn\u2019t consider premium changes in states including California and New York that set up their own online exchanges. \"To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges,\" the report says, \"the national average increase may differ\" from the report\u2019s results. --The report did not reach to checking premium changes on individual policies purchased privately, not through exchanges. In 2016, the report says, an HHS office estimated that the non-exchange individual market equaled 38 percent of total individual market enrollment. News accounts on the report similarly noted caveats. Prior to Obamacare, The Washington Post pointed out, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses and states varied the types of coverage insurers could offer. \"At the time,\" the newspaper said, \"health insurance could be sold with fewer medical benefits. This allowed for lower premiums for healthier people, but it also put coverage out of reach for millions of others.\" A New York Times story on the report said \"the plans and the insurance pools of 2013 are not the same as those of 2017. Some plans may have been cheaper in 2013, but covered so little that they would now fail to meet the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s definition of insurance.\" Most significantly, the Times reported, the HHS \"report compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: those in the entire individual market in 2013 and those only in the federal exchange in 2017.\" News reports also noted that the Obamacare law provides tax-credit subsidies to many insurance purchasers, driving down what they pay out of pocket--a point acknowledged in a report footnote. The Post\u2019s story said: \"But middle-class individuals and families, who make more than $48,240 or \u200b$98,400, respectively, often take on the full increases.\" Meantime, the Fact Checker at the Post provided additional perspective by noting the number of people directly affected by Obamacare premium increases breaks out to one-fourteenth the size of the employment-based health-insurance market. Experts suggest other considerations Tanner and Craig Palosky of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care, each noted a way togauge changes in premiums since the Obamacare law took full effect is to look at changes in premiums for the benchmark \"silver\" health plan, the second-lowest-cost insurance offering sold on exchanges. Kaiser\u2019s June 2017 analysis, taking into account plans available in each state to a 40-year-old, shows the 2017 average benchmark silver U.S. premium of $371 up 32 percent from $271 in 2014, the earliest year of comparison. In Texas, per the analysis, the 2017 average benchmark silver premium of $319 was up 29 percent from $248 in 2014. By email, Brandewie of Cornyn\u2019s staff said we were venturing into an apples-to-oranges comparison in that Cornyn\u2019s claim focused on all plans sold on exchanges in 39 states and started a year earlier. To our inquiry, Gail Wilensky, an economist who oversaw Medicaid and Medicare during President George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration, said by phone that \"the ultimate qualification is you don\u2019t know what would have happened to the premiums for this particular group in the absence of the Affordable Care Act. Having said that, we, of course, know the premiums have gone up a lot.\" Experts conceded that under the Obamacare law, tax credits have eased what 80-plus percent of purchasers on the exchanges pay for coverage. Regardless, Wilensky and Tanner each said, that doesn\u2019t make the premium increases less real; taxpayers pick up the costs of tax credits. Like Wilensky, Timothy Callaghan, a Texas A&M University expert on health policy, said a driver behind the difference in premiums is that insurance companies initially \"incorrectly priced their plans during the first year of exchange operations\" by expecting many more younger healthier adults to sign up in contrast to older individuals more likely to be ill--and then they had to adjust. Callaghan further suggested by email that \"at least some of the increase in premiums in the past year has been caused by the actions of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress and their efforts to repeal and replace the ACA and undermine it bureaucratically.\" We also asked the experts to look over data activist Charles Gaba\u2019s June 2017 web post, in the wake of the HHS report, estimating that across all 50 states, 2017 average monthly individual premiums on policies sold on exchanges were 84 percent greater than 2013 premiums on policies sold on the private market. Wilensky expressed doubts about figures Gaba relied on for New York and California while she, Tanner and Callaghan each said even an 84 percent rise over a few years seems large. Brandewie said he couldn\u2019t speak to Gaba\u2019s accuracy. Our ruling Cornyn told a constituent that under the Obamacare law, health insurance \"premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since\" 2013. This claim traces to an admittedly incomplete federal analysis of changes in 39 states that didn\u2019t endeavor to research premium changes in 11 states that run their own insurance exchanges. It\u2019s also worth clarifying that Obamacare policies must cover pre-existing conditions without penalty and they generally provide more benefits than what was required in most states in 2013\u2014surely factors figuring into increased premiums. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

They wanted to learn about White rage, a term none of us had heard of prior to him [Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff] testifying, right?\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., in remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Feb. 27 The former president\u2019s son, addressing the conservative faithful, often spoke in shorthand that would only make sense if you were a regular viewer of Fox News or Newsmax. His reference to \u201c6 million man-hours\u201d was echoed by some other speakers. So let\u2019s dive in and explain what\u2019s going on here. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s a number lacking significant context. The Facts A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment, but we quickly traced the source of the 6 million figure. Somewhat unique to Trumpworld, it was not a number invented out of whole cloth. Advertisement The figure comes from a letter sent by Milley to Sen. James M. Inhofe (Okla.), the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Inhofe had requested how much time was spent on three items required by the Defense Department \u2014 an extremism \u201cstand-down\u201d related to the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol, a climate change plan and a new diversity, equity and inclusion training program. The biggest chunk of time was devoted to the extremism stand-down \u2014 nearly 5.4 million hours. Since nearly 2.5 million members of the military participated, that means about two hours per person, which Milley noted is \u201ccomparable to other Joint Force periodic training requirements.\u201d The climate change plan (1,059 hours) and diversity training (529,711 hours) brought the total up to 5.9 million hours. But you can see that more than 90 percent of the total related to the extremism course. To put this big number in perspective, if every service member did just four hours of physical training a week \u2014 and the figure probably is higher \u2014 that would mean 10 million hours a week and more than 500 million hours a year. So 6 million hours for a discussion on extremism in the ranks is just a drop in the bucket. Advertisement Somehow, in the Fox News coverage, this got translated to Biden\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d agenda. Inhofe in a letter to Milley called it a \u201cleftist social agenda.\u201d Defense Department officials reject the claim that the extremism training either detracted from other training or was part of a left-wing agenda. \u201cSix million man-hours dedicated to extremism in no way degrades our combat capability or lethality,\u201d said Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Milley. In the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, in which dozens of those arrested were found to have military records, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin directed the Defense Department to provide education on the threat posed by extremist activity. After the stand-down, he directed that a series of recommendations be implemented, including clarifying the definition of prohibited extremist activity and reviewing screening questionnaires. Advertisement A Defense Department report released in December estimated that fewer than 100 members of the military had participated in extremist activity in the past year. \u201cExtremist activity within the Department of Defense is rare, but even the actions of a few can have an outsized impact on unit cohesion, morale and readiness \u2014 and the physical harm some of these activities can engender can undermine the safety of the Total Force,\u201d the report said. The military is primarily relying on commanders to identify possible extremists \u2014 a tactic that some experts say is inadequate as commanders are more focused on getting troops combat-ready. As for the stand-down itself, the course materials show it had four broad goals \u2014 reviewing the meaning of the oath taken by service members and Defense Department employees, reviewing impermissible behaviors, reviewing responsibilities to report prohibited actions and then a \u201clistening session\u201d to provide feedback. Military Times reported mixed feedback from troops, depending on how seriously trainers took the assignment. Advertisement \u201cI would say, and this is reflected in the material, that the stand-down was principally designed to reinforce for everyone the very meaning of the oath they take to the Constitution \u2014 and what that oath portends for the behavior expected of us: the dignity and respect we owe each other and the greater loyalty we owe to America\u2019s system of government,\u201d said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. As for Trump\u2019s reference to \u201cWhite rage,\u201d he\u2019s referring to a comment that Milley made during congressional testimony in June regarding a course taught at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that a lawmaker decried as critical race theory. The lawmaker, Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), claimed an instructor used phrases such as \u201cWhite rage.\u201d Milley replied that it was important for leaders to be well-versed in many schools of thought. \u201cI\u2019ve read Mao Zedong. I\u2019ve read Karl Marx. I\u2019ve read Lenin. That doesn\u2019t make me a communist,\u201d Milley told the House Armed Services Committee. \u201cSo what is wrong with understanding \u2026 the country which we are here to defend?\u201d Advertisement He added: \u201cI want to understand White rage. And I\u2019m White. What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out.\u201d The Pinocchio Test Notice the sneaky trick that Trump Jr. plays here. The vast majority of the \u201c6 million man-hours\u201d and the \u201cWhite rage\u201d comment concerned the attack on the Capitol by supporters of his father \u2014 an attack that the former president has defended and even seemed to celebrate. But his son does not make that clear. Instead he claims that this is all about a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d imposed by the Biden administration. To some extent that might be a matter of opinion, but it seems like a real stretch. We cannot quite get to Four Pinocchios because the 6 million figure is based on a real estimate. But there is no evidence that this relatively minor course detracted from any military training \u2014 and Trump Jr. entirely mischaracterizes what the training was for.

        "claim": "\"In Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy.\"",
        "doc": "Befitting her previous position as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton\u2019s new book, Hard Choices, ranges across the globe, occasionally looking back into history long before she took the helm at the State Department. For instance, Clinton writes that \"in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy.\" We had always closely associated the Iranian Revolution with Islamic fundamentalism. Was Clinton\u2019s summary correct? We checked in with several scholars who have studied the region, and their consensus was that Clinton was broadly correct, despite a bit of oversimplification. First, some background. The revolution began in the late 1970s, amid simmering discontent among Iranians about Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the autocratic leader who operated a feared secret police. Even as he maintained generally (but not uninterrupted) good ties to the West, his standing at home was deteriorating. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric living in Paris, courted support among critics of the Shah. After a series of strikes and protests, the Shah in January 1979 left for an \"extended vacation,\" never to return home. The handpicked leaders the Shah left behind tried to prevent Khomeini from forming a government, but after the cleric returned to Tehran in February 1979, unrest grew. In mid February, supporters of Khomeini declared a revolutionary state, and within two months, Khomeini won a national referendum. \"The strongest images of Iran's revolution come from those early years\" of 1979 to 1982, wrote Robin Wright in her 2000 book, The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in Iran. \"Many still linger in the minds of outsiders: The demonstrations by rifle-toting mullahs and chador-clad women. The morgue slabs with bullet-riddled bodies of officials from the monarchy and other loyalists who were summarily executed in the course of revolutionary justice. The seizure of the United States Embassy and 52 hostages who, over the next 444 days, were often paraded with crude blindfolds in front of cameras as effigies of Uncle Sam were burned in the background by angry youths. This was the delirium.\" Largely lost in this popular image is the fact that the revolution\u2019s supporters were not exclusively Islamist -- perhaps not even primarily Islamist. The Shah\u2019s regime had made enemies of leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, democrats and the moderately religious. All of these groups, to one degree or another, were supporters of revolution against the Shah. Clinton \"is absolutely correct that the revolution of 1979 was a broad-based revolution against theShah,\" said Mohsen M. Milani, executive director of the University of South Florida\u2019s World Center for Strategic and Diplomatic Studies. \"In fact, it was one of the most popular revolutions of the modern era.\" Gary Sick, an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and author of All Fall Down: America's Tragic Encounter With Iran and October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan, agreed. \"The fact is that most of the millions of Iranians who took to the streets to oppose the Shah did not think they were going to replace him with a theocratic state,\" Sick said. \"That was the work of Khomeini and his followers, and it was actively opposed by many of the secular -- and even clerical -- revolutionaries.\" Some of the historians we checked with took mild issue with the phrase \"hijacked,\" since Khomeini -- who for many Americans personifies Islamic extremism -- was always the central player in the revolution. After all, it\u2019s hard to hijack a revolution you\u2019d always led. But there\u2019s an explanation for this paradox: Initially, Khomeini had openly stated that he was not pursuing a theocracy. \"Iran's emergence as a modern theocracy was never written in the heavens,\" Wright wrote in her book. \"Quite the contrary. In earlier pronouncements about a just government Ayatollah Khomeini actually said he didn't advocate clerical rule. \u2026 In one of his last interviews before leaving Paris, Ayatollah Khomeini told Le Monde, \u2018Our intention is not that religious leaders themselves should administer the state.\u2019 \"Once the tumultuous fanfare of his return died down, the Imam seemed almost uninterested in day-to-day government affairs. The ayatollah, already in his late seventies, instead went back to the dusty theological center of Qom. He seemed content to leave politics to the first revolutionary government of secular technocrats. His role was limited to settling disputes.\" That changed with the effort to write Iran\u2019s Constitution in the fall of 1979. \"Fearful that other changes might further marginalize or even exclude them, Ayatollah Khomeini's followers introduced a process to vet candidates' credentials -- a precedent that time and again allowed them to manipulate future elections, too,\" Wright wrote. \"It worked. They won a majority. And the final draft (of the constitution) ended up thoroughly Islamic.\" Even then, the Islamic revolution wasn\u2019t complete, Wright wrote: \"For the first presidential election in January 1980, a full year after the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini decreed that no clerics could run for president -- further proof that he still didn't intend to establish a total theocracy. Over the next 18 months, however, Iran was wracked by bloodshed as the ruling clergy and their adjutants gradually eliminated former partners -- leftists, nationalists and intellectuals--from any claim to power.\" Iran became fully Islamist in October 1981, when the cleric Ali Khamanei won the third presidential election -- the first election in which clerics were allowed to run. \"As of October 1981,\" Wright wrote, \"the mullahs were no longer only the supervisors and shadows of the state. They now dominated all its branches.\" The experts we talked to quibbled slightly with Clinton\u2019s claim, saying it\u2019s a bit oversimplified. Notably, Clinton inaccurately compresses the time frame. The changes she\u2019s talking about didn\u2019t just happen immediately in 1979 but rather played out in an evolutionary fashion for two years after the Shah fell. \"If you have to do the whole history in 19 words, it's probably okay,\" said John Limbert, historian and political scientist at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of Iran: At War with History. Stephen Kinzer, a Boston University professor and author of the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America\u2019s Future, said Clinton is generally correct that \"the Iranian revolution was broad-based, and one faction later seized control, establishing a brutal theocracy.\" Our ruling Clinton said that \"in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy.\" She\u2019s generally correct, experts say, despite questions over whether \"hijacked\" is the right word and whether she used an overly broad time frame.

        "claim": "Says President Obama has grown the federal government payroll by 141,000 workers and wants to add 125,000 more.",
        "doc": "Eager to ridicule the economic stimulus package, Republicans long have pounded President Barack Obama for overseeing a rise in federal government employees even while private-sector payrolls have shriveled.It started over the summer, when two Ohio congressmen -- including soon-to-be U.S. House Speaker John Boehner -- separately claimed the federal payroll had jumped by 400,000 or 590,000 since Obama took office in January 2009.Those claims were greatly inflated by including temporary U.S. Census workers, PolitiFact National found.Now the GOP is back with a new set of numbers.In the wake of election victories, officials are working them into interviews and even social-networking messages, such as this Nov. 16, 2010 Twitter post from Reince Priebus (@ReincePriebus), chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin: \"Obama has grown fed. payroll by 141k workers-not counting Census, postal, & uniformed military. Wants to add 125k more.\"Priebus weighed in on this national topic -- coincidentally we assume -- about a week after his name came up in speculation about succeeding Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele at some point.Priebus\u2019 tweet linked to a Fox News.com story that quoted U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who is in line to run a House subcommittee on federal employment.Chaffetz was pushing a 10 percent across-the-board pay cut for federal employees. He told Fox that Obama had added 141,000 federal workers. The Fox story, without attribution, added: The president wants to hire 125,000 more workers.\"Since the numbers had changed from the summer, we wondered how the new ones added up.First some context and history.Federal employment figures are cyclical. They are lower now than 20 years ago. The federal payroll began a dive in the 1990s, rose again after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, held pretty steady for much of the last decade -- then began a sharp climb up in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.The White House and private analysts attribute much of the rise this decade to homeland security and civilian defense positions related to fighting two wars and international terrorism.Let\u2019s start with how much the federal work force has gone up.During Obama\u2019s tenure, the number of federal workers has increased by about 141,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- though it is in large part a product of Bush\u2019s last budget.Priebus and Chaffetz did not include census workers, avoiding the misleading approach taken by Boehner and others.They also excluded U.S. Postal Service workers in their count, which tallies some 2.19 million civilian federal workers. That makes the increase much larger than it otherwise would be, since the postal workforce is shrinking.Got that?If the postal workers cuts were included, the overall increase in employees under Obama would be about 40,000, or a modest 1.4 percent increase in the workforce. By leaving the postal service out, as the GOP does, the increase is 141,000 jobs, or almost 7 percent.That\u2019s a huge difference.Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, says postal workers are federal employees and should be included.But government statisticians, the White House and some private watchdog groups routinely exclude postal workers in their reports. So Chaffetz and Priebus are not off base -- and both were careful to note which workers they meant.A second caveat is more important.Obama was elected in November of 2008 and took office in January of 2009. An analysis by Cato, the libertarian think tank, said the vast majority of spending for the 2008-\u201909 year -- which began a month before the election -- was from Bush-implemented changes.If you start counting with the first full fiscal year under Obama, the job increase under Obama is half of the 141,000. But it\u2019s also true that Obama picked up the ball from Bush and ran with it.Let\u2019s look at part two of the Priebus claim: that Obama wants to add 125,000 more workers.It\u2019s based on the Fox story, which did not attribute that number to anyone.The 125,000 figure is an apparent reference to fiscal year 2011. But the 125,000 figure is not the projected job growth in fiscal year 2011 -- it\u2019s just new hires, according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, which provides research for The Washington Post.Priebus\u2019 tweet makes it sound as if that 125,000 would come on top of the 141,000 increase. But two-thirds of the 125,000 hires will replace departing federal workers, the Partnership estimated. So those positions won\u2019t grow the number of federal jobs.We won\u2019t know until next fall, when the 2011 fiscal year ends, how many net jobs were added across the government.But like any good charge, a pointed tweet doesn\u2019t wait.So, our evaluation won\u2019t wait either.Like others in his party, state GOP chairman Reince Priebus\u2019 claim on federal hiring takes a statistical approach that makes the 2009-\u201910 trend more dramatic than under another method. And the claim pins the entire growth on Obama, while ignoring the budget implemented by Bush. But it\u2019s a legitimate number, commonly used, and clearly defined.The second claim is off base, using a new-hire number as a proxy for job growth to suggest that Obama would nearly double the two-year job growth in one year. The mixed message earns Priebus a Half True.",

The post even claims that 12 hours after consumption of the banana, the person will die from brain death. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Video of Somalia bananas having a worm called Helicobacter which will cause brain death 12 hours after its consumption. Fact: Helicobacter is a type of bacteria and not a type of worm. When the same video went viral in Abu Dhabi, the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority had said the video was incorrect and contains false and misleading information. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE. When reverse image search is done on the screenshots of the video, a Persian article having the same video was found. According to the article, this viral video was released in Iranian cyberspace, where it was being claimed that the bananas were imported from Somalia to Iran. Dr. Haji Mohammadi, a Ph.D. in Food Toxicology, says that \u2018Helicobacter\u2019 is the name of a bacterium and not a worm. The article could not verify the authenticity of the video; if the worms are assumed to be true, they are anyhow not pathogenic to humans. The video went viral in different parts of West Asia, with the same claim. The authorities from Abu Dhabi had debunked the viral video and confirmed that the message contains \u2018false and misleading information\u2019.

Infections with Helicobacter are quite common, apparently two-thirds of the world have it in their bodies. For some people, the bacteria may cause stomach ulcers or cancer, where the symptoms are seen after many years. But for most people, the bacteria \u2013 which can enter and live in your digestive tract \u2013 doesn\u2019t cause any symptoms. With good health habits, access to clean drinking water and sanitation, one can protect oneself from the bacteria. The worm-like species taken out from inside the banana in the video, are most likely maggots, though we cannot confirm conclusively. Fruit flies at the \u2018larvae\u2019 stage are generally called maggots. Maggots feed inside the fruit and they are introduced when the female fly lays its eggs. \u201cThe larval stage is the most likely stage that you would recognise the presence of fruit fly in your fruit if you cut it open.\u201d Bananas are one of the most consumed and cheapest fruits worldwide: they are the most traded fruit and the fifth most traded agricultural product. India ranks first in global production of bananas, around 31.75 million MT in 2018-19 (approx. 32% of global production). India is also one of the largest consumers. In 2018, India with 25% was the largest banana market based on physical terms. According to reports, India exported bananas worth 619 Cr during 2020-21. Further, there is no data to prove that 500 tons of Bananas were imported into India from Somalia. The official data from the Commerce Ministry shows that India did not import Banana from Somalia at all. To sum it up, this video with a claim that Somalia bananas have a worm called Helicobacter which will cause brain death in 12 hours, is not true.",

        "doc": "When president Uhuru Kenyatta delivered his state of the nation address on 30 November 2021, he didn't correct some inaccuracies Africa Check identified in his Mashujaa Day speech a month before. Any Kenyan president is required to give a proper assessment of the state of the country each year. In this extensive report, we examine 15 claims in the address. We have again asked the president's office for the source of the data. On 30 November Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta addressed a joint sitting of parliament on the state of the nation, as required by law . In his speech Kenyatta focused on the post-pandemic economy. He also claimed achievements in building roads, schools, electrification, healthcare and more. Did he get all his facts right? We took a closer look at 15 key claims he made, some recycled from his Mashujaa \u2013 Heroes' \u2013 Day speech on 20 October, despite Africa Check having found them to be incorrect or misleading . We have asked the president's office for the sources of the data used in the speech and will update this report when we hear back. \"While most economies in the world shrank, Kenya's economy grew at 0.3%,\" Kenyatta said . He called this \"positive\" \u2013 if \"minimal\" \u2013 growth. It's a claim he also made on Mashujaa Day. Benjamini Muchiri, a senior manager at the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics d irected us to the most recent economic survey for reliable data on growth. It was published in September 2021. The survey says Kenya's economy shrank by 0.3% in 2020 . World Bank data shows the same 0.3% contraction . And in a speech launching the survey, Kenyatta's finance minister Ukur Yatani also said the economy was \"estimated to have contracted by 0.3% in 2020\". Yatani attributed this to lockdown-related restrictions and a reduced demand for goods and services. \u2013 Makinia Juma The national statistics office has the data to check this claim, John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the Kenya office of the International Budget Partnership thinktank told Africa Check. The data agency publishes quarterly gross domestic product reports, most recently in October 2021. This shows that Kenya's GDP at market prices grew by 10.1% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2020. Uhuru Kenyatta delivers 2021 state of the nation address. CITIZEN TV SCREENGRAB The 10.1% is not \" real GDP \", as the president claimed. It's nominal GDP at market prices, unadjusted for inflation. Not taking inflation into account tends to distort the value of an economy. \"The problem with the president's statement is that we are missing the context,\" Kinuthia said. \"The 'phenomenal growth' was because we are comparing it to a period when the economy was locked down.\" In the second quarter of 2020, Kenya's economy shrank by -5.7%. This was mainly due to restrictive measures aimed at countering Covid-19. Because of their unprecedented nature, a sharp recovery would be expected when these measures were eased, as noted by the statistics office. Prof Charles Wheelan is a senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the US and author of Naked Statistics , among other works. \"This is not a sign of robust new economic growth. It is a sign of recovery,\" he told Africa Check. \"It's not like getting a big raise at work. It's more like being unemployed for a spell and then getting your old job back. It's good \u2013 clearly better than the alternative \u2013 but not a huge sign of progress.\" The president was right that the economy grew by a higher than normal pace of 10.1% in the second quarter, but he left out important context. We therefore rate his claim as misleading. (Find out more about how we rate claims .) \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Data from the statistics bureau shows that the 10.1% growth in the second quarter of 2020 was the highest of any quarter in two decades \u2013 since 2000. We asked the bureau's director-general Macdonald Obudho if there was earlier data. He said there wasn't. \"We do not have any data before that time. We were not generating quarterly GDP data before,\" Obudho said. Kenya gained independence in 1963 , almost six decades ago. But the available quarterly GDP data only goes back to 2000. We can therefore only rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu For historical data, the International Budget Partnership 's Kinuthia directed us to the world development indicators , a World Bank database covering 217 economies \u2013 189 member countries and 28 \"other\" economies. The data shows that Kenya's economy grew by 22% in 1971 and 17% in 1972. The 10.1% rise in the second quarter of 2020 is therefore not \"the first time\" the country has had double-digit economic growth. And Dartmouth College's Wheelan explained that \"double digit growth\" usually means \"GDP growth (stripped of inflation) of 10% a year\". He added: \"The government can credibly say that the economy appears to be undergoing a robust recovery. It's a stretch for them to say they are delivering double-digit rates of growth as that phrase typically is used in a context that suggests policies or developments that are permanently raising the productive capacity of a country, not merely bouncing back after a shock.\" We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu In his delivered speech , Kenyatta said the rise was from 180 to 651 beds. But the text version gives it as from 108 beds. Before the pandemic, he said , there was only an average of two ICU beds in each of Kenya's 47 counties. We checked this exact claim in the president's Mashujaa Day speech and found it to be unproven. Read our detailed findings as to why his numbers still do not add up. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's statistics bureau gives figures on the country's power situation in its yearly economic surveys. The figures come from the electricity utility Kenya Power and the power-generating company KenGen . The 2014 economic survey says the country had 1,717.8 megawatts of total installed capacity in 2013, not 1,300 MW. Similarly, Kenya Power data shows that on 30 June 2013, two months after Kenyatta was sworn in, installed capacity was at 1,765 MW . The president understated the electricity available in 2013 by more than 400 MW. The grid capacity was closest to the president's claim in 2009, when it was at 1,311 MW . This was four years before he took office. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu In 2020, the country's installed capacity was 2,836.7 MW, according to the statistics bureau's most recent economic survey , released in September 2021. Available electricity has increased by 1,118.9 MW since 2013. This is a 65% rise, close to two thirds. Capacity has not doubled. We also checked Kenya Power's most recent report . This showed that on 30 June 2021, Kenya had 2,984 MW in its grid. The increase from June 2013 to June 2021 is 1,219 MW or 69%. There's no evidence that installed capacity has doubled since 2013. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu The increase from 2013 to 2021, according to Kenya Power's most recent data is 1266.2 MW, an average increase of 158.3 MW a year. For Kenyatta's administration to have installed 325 MW every year for eight years, the total increase would have had to be 2,600 MW. We rate the claim as incorrect. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenya Power says it supplies electricity to \"individual households, private industries, companies and government institutions\". Its 2013 report shows there were a total of 2,330,962 customers connected to electricity. But only 2.1 million were domestic customers, or households. That means about 200,000 were other customers. Kenyatta equates the total customer base to household connections. This gives a misleading picture of households' access to electricity in 2013. \u2013 Makinia Juma Has the Kenyatta administration tripled the number of households connected to electricity? We sifted through Kenya Power's annual reports, and found the numbers in the table below. Kenya Power customers 2013-2021 Year Total customers Domestic customers Increase in domestic customers 2012/13 2,330,962 2,059,340 2013/14 2,767,983 2,481,856 422,516 2014/15 3,611,904 3,305,934 824,078 2015/16 4,890,373 4,565,907 1,259,973 2016/17 6,182,282 5,839,865 1,273,958 2017/18 6,761,090 6,404,632 564,767 2018/19 7,067,861 6,682,137 277,505 2019/20 7,576,145 7,156,429 474,292 2020/21 8,278,203 7,852,051 695,622 5,792,711 Source: Kenya Powe r The increase in domestic customers from 2012/13 to 2020/21 adds up to 5.79 million \u2013 not 6.3 million. The number of households connected to Kenya Power's grid did almost triple under Kenyatta's administration. But the president overstates the increase by about 500,000. His claim is exaggerated. \u2013 Makinia Juma The increase from 2013 to 2021 , according to the most recent data, is 5.79 million \u2013 an average of 726,589 a year. This works out to 1,990 connections a day since 2013, when Kenyatta's administration came to power. The claim is mostly correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenya's constitution provides for the equitable sharing of money between the national government and the 47 counties. The counties became operational after elections in March 2013. These units of government should receive \"not less than 15%\" of all revenue collected by the national government. \"The 15% is the minimum that has to be sent to the counties but, the principle is, the allocations to counties should cover the devolved functions,\" the International Budget Partnership's Kinuthia told us. The Commission on Revenue Allocation assesses the cost of county functions and recommends how funds are shared between national and county government. The recommendations are either adopted or changed by the Division of Revenue Act , if approved by Kenya's parliament . The allocations from 2013 to 2021 are in the table below. ALLOCATIONS TO KENYA COUNTIES 2013-2021 Year Equitable share (KSh billion) (%) of most recent revenues audited and approved by parliament Year of most recent audited revenues 2013/14 190 27.9% 2011/12 2014/15 226.7 43% 2009/10 2015/16 259.8 33% 2012/13 2016/17 280.3 30% 2013/14 2017 / 18 302 32% 2013/14 2018/19 314 33.6% 2013/14 2019/20 316.5 30.5% 2014/15 2020/21 316.5 23.3% 2016/17 Source: Division of Revenue Acts from the National Council for Legal Reporting Going by the equitable shares, the average county allocation over the eight financial years for which allocations have been made works out to 31.6% of the most recent audited revenues. But the \"most recent audited and approved revenues\" are at least three financial years behind, giving a misleading picture \u2013 the percentage allocation looks rosy, but the actual amount is low, Kinuthia said. Ideally, the revenues from the previous financial year should be audited and approved by the national assembly in time for the next budget, but this has not happened. The president's numbers may appear correct, but they only give a partial picture. He omits the context of the 15% as a minimum, the role of the CRA in costing the functions before the sharing is done, and the fact that there's at least a three-year lag between the allocations and the most-recent audited and approved revenues. In the end, it paints a misleading picture. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenyatta said the country's taxman \u2013 the Kenya Revenue Authority \u2013 had collected KSh10.8 trillion since 2013. He added that the amount was \"equivalent to Kenya's GDP\". We checked the authority's data for total revenue collected since 2013. Financial year Revenue collected (trillion Kenyan shillings) 2013/14 0.96 2014/15 1.1 2015/16 1.21 2016/17 1.37 2017/18 1.44 2018/19 1.58 2019/20 1.61 2020/21 1.67 Total tax revenue 2013/14 to 2020/21 10.83 Source: Kenya Revenue Authority . Numbers rounded off. Kenya's GDP was KSh10.8 trillion in 2020/21, according to the statistics bureau. The World Bank's figure is KSh10.5 trillion for 2020. Available data indicates that the Kenya Revenue Authority did collect KSh10.8 trillion in the eight financial years from 2013/14 to 2020/21. The amount is equivalent to the country's GDP in 2020. We rate the claim as correct. \u2013 Makinia Juma The police-population ratio indicates the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. Kenyatta made the same claim on Mashujaa Day. But when we fact-checked it, we found it to be incorrect. Our report explains why. What data there is shows that while the ratio has improved over the eight years of the president's term, it was at its highest in 2018. There's also no \"prescribed\" United Nations \"standard\" for a policing ratio. Experts have previously told Africa Check that such a recommendation would have little meaning, given countries' significant differences in police functions and capabilities, and the security challenges they face. Instead, the quality of policing is a better indicator. \u2013 Makinia Juma Kenyatta said the Kenya Meat Commission , the state-owned meat processor, has an outlet that \"collects KSh1 million\" every day after the military controversially took over its management. The military had turned it around, he said. The KSh1 million a day translated to an average of KSh30 million a month, he said . But is it KSh3.6 billion a year? Here's the maths. Multiplying KSh30 million (one month average) by 12 (months in a year) comes to KSh360 million, not KSh3.6 billion. The president's figure is 10 times off the mark. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu",

The poem describes life much like today: \"And people stayed at home, and read books, and listened, and they rested, and did exercises, and made art and played.\" But the posts sharing the poem have been flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

You do not have to do much, just register on the website of the Canadian Partnership project and wait for the call from the support center,\" says a January 21, 2023 Facebook post. Facebook pages based in Toronto shared nearly identical posts. Some link to a survey website that asks users to disclose their monthly income, phone number and email address to learn more about the offer. AFP searched for \"Canadian Partnership\" in the CSA's national registration database and did not find any record of a company with that name. The CSA warns against engaging with \"unsolicited investment offers made online, on social media or over the phone.\" The agency also advises investors to consult with independent financial experts before pursuing an offer. AFP queried the CSA and the Ontario Securities Commission about the supposed program, but responses were not forthcoming. The posts include a video with text that says: \"The Canadian government has released a platform to support citizens.\" The clip claims the government backs an effort to \"equalize incomes across provinces.\" But there is no such investment program. Equalization refers to how the federal government addresses fiscal disparities between provinces, not individuals. The video also depicts Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, claiming he spoke about the \"Canadian Partnership\" program. But the clip is from an unrelated interview. A reverse image search indicates the footage is from November 30, 2022, when Trudeau spoke at the Reuters NEXT conference. The full interview shows Trudeau was responding to a question about Canada's Indo-Pacific strategy. Some of the posts link to a website with a supposed article from Elizabeth Thompson of CBC News. \"Up to 15,000C$ through a single investment in the development of Canada,\" the purported headline says. But both Thompson and the CBC said they did not produce the story. \"We can confirm this is not CBC's website and as such, we did not publish this article,\" said spokesman Chuck Thompson. Elizabeth Thompson directed AFP to her author profile on CBC's website. \"You'll see that my photo is different and I did not file a story on that day,\" she said via email.

        "doc": "Crime may not pay, but it sure costs Georgia a lot of money.In some cases, too much, says Gov. Nathan Deal.During his second State of the State address earlier this month, Deal said Georgia has one of the biggest prison populations in the nation. Housing those prisoners costs money, which troubles state leaders as Georgia wades through an uncertain economy.Still, Deal said far too many of these inmates are former Georgia inmates who are committing crimes and being sent back to prison.\"[H]istory has shown that offenders simply return to the prison population,\" the governor said. \"Right now in Georgia, nearly one in three leaving our prisons are re-convicted within three years.\"One in three are re-convicted within three years? We decided to fact-check this claim.Criminal justice reform will be one of the top items on the menu for state lawmakers to chew on this legislative session. Georgia currently spends about $1 billion a year on corrections, state officials say. That is more than double the $492 million the state spent on correctional services in 1990. The growth in corrections spending is second behind Medicaid, state officials said. Many believe it is unsustainable.During the past two decades, Georgia\u2019s prison population has more than doubled to 56,000 inmates despite a decrease in crime rates in the past 10 years, according to a state report released in November.\"If current policies remain in place, analysis indicates that Georgia\u2019s prison population will rise by another 8 percent to reach nearly 60,000 inmates by 2016, presenting the state with the need to spend an additional $264 million to expand capacity,\" the report said.Last year, the Pew Center on the States released a widely reported study on recidivism rates. In 1999, nearly 17,000 people were released from Georgia state prisons, the study reported. Thirty-eight percent of those released were incarcerated again within three years, Pew found.In 2004, about 19,000 men and women were released from state prisons in Georgia. About 35 percent of them were back in prison by 2007, Pew found.Those numbers seemed dated, so PolitiFact Georgia searched for some more recent information. The Georgia Department of Corrections website\u2019s most recent data is through fiscal year 2008. The recidivism rate within three years for state prisons, where the largest percentage of Georgia prisoners is held, was 27.5 percent, the state\u2019s website says. The recidivism rate in most of the other categories of prisons ranged from 22 to 25 percent. Probation boot camps were the only types of prisons with a recidivism rate of one-third.In Georgia, most of the people who were sent back to prison went for a technical violation, according to the Pew report. Georgia\u2019s probation sentences -- about seven years -- are almost twice the national average, the state report found.In 2010, state courts sent more than 5,000 lower-risk drug and property offenders to prison who had never been to prison before, accounting for 25 percent of all admissions, according to the state report. The state report suggested giving judges more sentencing options -- such as probation -- for low-level, nonviolent drug possession offenders -- which might reduce the recidivism rate.\"This option would reduce the growth of the prison population by approximately 300 to 900 additional beds,\" the state report said.The Pew report on recidivism is more than one-third, which helps any argument that Deal would make that his statement is correct. The most recent state data shows the recidivism rate is slightly less than one-third.The governor said in his speech that the rate was \"nearly\" one in three. We believe all of the numbers we saw support his statement. Our rating: True.",

        "claim": "Says more than eight countries lead the United States in the percentage of college graduates.",
        "doc": "Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he was disgusted and angry.With federal officials mired in debate over raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, Booker appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on July 24 to discuss political gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital.The generation of the Great Depression built the Hoover Dam and the Empire State Building at that time of crisis, but now \"Rome, our capital, is fiddling with itself while the nation is burning,\" Booker said.Booker then pointed out how the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of college graduates it produces.\"We are a nation that, in that generation said, you know, \u2018We're going to go to the moon. And we're going to do math and science and make sure that our kids are prepared to go there.\u2019 But right now what's happening?\u2019\" Booker said. \"Nations are passing us in droves. Over eight different countries now have a higher proportion of people graduating from college than we do.\"PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Booker\u2019s claim about the country\u2019s college graduation rate was mostly right. In terms of young adults with the equivalent of an associate\u2019s degree or higher, the United States is tied for ninth among the 36 countries analyzed by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.First, let\u2019s talk about how Booker received his numbers.The mayor\u2019s spokeswoman referred us to an Oct. 19, 2010 speech by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, in which he said: \"Today, in eight other nations, including South Korea, young adults are more likely to have college degrees than in the U.S.\"U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman Jane Glickman provided statistics from \"Education at a Glance 2010: OECD Indicators,\" which compares countries based on 2008 data. The OECD includes 34 member countries and works with other partner countries.According to that 2010 report, the United States ranked ninth in the percentage of people between ages 25 and 34 to achieve an associate\u2019s degree or higher. At 42 percent, the United States was tied with Israel, Belgium and Australia, according to the report.The eight countries leading the United States in that age group were South Korea at 58 percent, followed by Canada, Russian Federation, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland and Denmark, according to the report.Older generations in the United States have fared better than in its OECD counterparts. The United States ranked higher in the percentage of adults between ages 35 and 64 who have college degrees, according to the report.\"Not too long ago we ranked at or near the top in the world, and while our rate has grown very slowly, other countries have experienced rapid increases and overtaken us,\" Glickman wrote in an email, adding \"we must sit up and take notice, especially since a degree is increasingly important for job opportunities in a changing economy.\"So Booker was right about young adults being more likely to have college degrees in eight other countries.But Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, said in an email that one should not put too much emphasis on small differences between countries, because of the varied educational systems.Large proportions of young people in Germany and Austria enter apprenticeship arrangements, instead of higher education, Schleicher said. Russian Federation\u2019s high graduation rate is related to short-term engineering studies that may not exist in other countries or only at the upper secondary level, which is comparable to high school in the United States, he said.\"A range of factors may affect the figures including the organization of the education and training system and government policies regarding education,\" Schleicher said in the email.Alan Ruby, a senior fellow in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said four of those eight countries leading the United States don\u2019t make for good comparisons because of their smaller sizes.But why does the United States rank below some of the other countries?Schleicher suggested the tuition fees in the United States -- the highest in the OECD -- affect participation rates. Ruby said some young people falsely believe there aren\u2019t benefits to attending college.Let\u2019s review:Booker said the United States trails \"over eight different countries\" in college graduates. The mayor shouldn\u2019t have included the word \"over\" in his statement, but he\u2019s on target when it comes to the younger generation of college graduates.But since each country may have different educational policies affecting the overall rankings, we rate the statement Mostly True.

        "claim": "Says Alison Lundergan Grimes \"supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare.\"",
        "doc": "One of Republicans\u2019 favorite Affordable Care Act talking points is back in fashion. Back in 2012, we checked the claim that the health care law cuts $700 billion from Medicare more times than we can count. (For a sample, look here, here and here.) It\u2019s popped up again in this year\u2019s Senate race in Kentucky. Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes recently accused incumbent Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of supporting a $6,000 per year increase in Medicare costs for beneficiaries -- another once-popular claim resurfacing. We\u2019ve rated that False. The McConnell campaign swiftly retaliated with an ad of its own the next day. \"The truth? Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare. That\u2019s how Obama and Grimes will pay for Obamacare,\" the ad says. For old times\u2019 sake, we decided to look into the claim once again. The $700 billion 'cuts' The Affordable Care Act is projected to reduce federal spending on Medicare by about $716 billion between 2013 and 2022, but it does not literally cut funding from the program or reduce its overall budget. In fact, spending will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The Affordable Care Act just slows its growth, instituting a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not seniors. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. The program, started under President George W. Bush, has cost more than expected -- and more than traditional Medicare. Hospitals will also be paid less if they have too many readmissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Also, the $716 billion in reductions is not really being used to \"pay for\" the law, as McConnell said. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to federal budget deficits. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law\u2019s new spending over a period of about 10 years. Some of the new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. Does Grimes support the Affordable Care Act? When the law was enacted in 2010, Grimes was working as an attorney in Lexington, Ky., and played no role in the Affordable Care Act debate. But she hasn\u2019t been able to avoid questions about her stance on the law this election cycle. Since the start of her campaign, Grimes has said she is troubled by certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. She has also said the solution is to improve on the law, rather than to throw it out completely. She\u2019s spoken positively of 640,000 Kentuckians who were previously uninsured and will now be able to get insurance. It\u2019s a bit harder to pin down her position on the Medicare spending reductions specifically. At the 2013 Kentucky State Fair, a reporter from the Louisville television station WHAS 11 asked Grimes if she agreed with Republicans that the Affordable Care Act would hurt senior citizens. \"I\u2019m troubled with certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act,\" she said. \"But we're here at the State Fair, and if there's three reasons why Kentuckians, especially our seniors, need access to affordable health care coverage, you just have to look over to the right where you see the donut burger, the chili cheese steak and the covered French fries.\" We should note that the 2012 Republican budget championed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also trimmed future Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount as the health care law. (And McConnell voted to consider Ryan\u2019s plan that May.) Our ruling An ad out of the McConnell campaign said, \"Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare.\" Grimes has been cautiously supportive of the Affordable Care Act, and she certainly does not oppose it as strongly as McConnell does. The law is projected to reduce spending on Medicare by about $700 billion over 10 years, but those reductions in spending are more of a slowed growth rate rather than a budget cut.

        "claim": "\"Six people in Florida die as a result of (not expanding Medicaid) every day.\"",
        "doc": "Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, now running for his old position as a Democrat, has attacked Republican Gov. Rick Scott for his tepid support for Medicaid expansion last year. Scott had said he would support it, but he didn\u2019t lobby for it, and ultimately the state Legislature rejected the expansion. In a Feb. 7 interview on MSNBC\u2019s The Daily Rundown, Crist said that means \"about 1 million of my fellow Floridians are not getting health care today, and I\u2019m told by my friends at (the Service Employees International Union) that means that six people in Florida die as a result of that every day.\" Is Crist\u2019s diagnosis correct? Do six Floridians die a day because the Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion? The Health Affairs study Crist\u2019s claim comes from a study released in late January on the blog of the health-policy journal Health Affairs. It was authored by researchers from Harvard University and the City University of New York. The researchers looked at states that had opted out of Medicaid expansion, including Florida, where about 1.27 million people would have been eligible. Researchers then used prior studies about the effects of expanding insurance to estimate a low-end number and a high-end number of deaths for each state that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. In Florida, the study concluded, the number of deaths would range from 1,158 to 2,221. The only state with more projected deaths was Texas. Crist arrived at his six-deaths-a-day figure for Florida by using the high end of the range cited in the study -- 2,221 deaths divided by 365 days a year works out to sixdeaths a day. If he had used the low-end figure, it would have worked out to three deaths per day. So what were the underlying studies? They were: \u2022 The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a comparison of about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn\u2019t. The study tracked factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, depression, and out-of-pocket medical spending. (PolitiFact has previously written about the mixed results of the health outcomes found in the Oregon study.) \u2022A study by Harvard researchers Benjamin D. Sommers and Katherine Baicker compared three states that expanded Medicaid -- New York, Maine and Arizona -- with neighboring states that didn\u2019t expand it. This is what the Harvard/CUNY researchers used to calculate their high estimate of deaths and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012. The sample consisted of adults who were observed five years before and after the expansions, from 1997 through 2007. \u2022A study by Harvard researchers about health insurance and deaths. This produced the low-deaths estimate. The study was published in 2009 in the American Journal of Public Health; it followed indivduals over 16 years. (Two of the authors of this study are also authors of the new Harvard/CUNY study.) The Harvard/CUNY study arrived at the death figures by looking at the number of individuals with depression, the number of patients on diabetic medications, the number of women who had a mammogram or pap smear in the past year and the number of people who had catastrophic medical expenses in the past year. We interviewed two of the authors of the study, including Harvard professor Danny McCormick. The lack of Medicaid expansion will mean that patients nationwide won\u2019t get certain diagnostic tests or take certain medications. \"Cumulatively, that amounts to vast numbers of deaths,\" McCormick said. We asked McCormick how researchers can know that the differences in the death rates between the Medicaid expansion states and the states that didn\u2019t expand were as a result of Medicaid. \"We don\u2019t know absolutely because we didn\u2019t do a randomized control trial with long-term followup on millions of people,\" McCormick said. \"For $10 billion we could do that study.\" Experts weigh in on study We asked a variety of health policy experts their opinion about Crist\u2019s claim. Many experts told PolitiFact that denying Medicaid to poor Floridians will harm their health. But placing a precise figure as to how many will die per day, they added, is difficult. \"There is strong consensus in the public health community that this is a very harmful policy,\" said Harold Pollack, who told PolitiFact he is a \"liberal health policy wonk\" at the University of Chicago. However \"the most difficult aspect of that policy to investigate is its effect on mortality.\" Pollack said Crist is on solid ground to point out that the lack of Medicaid expansion causes serious harm. However, \"I personally believe that these mortality estimates were on the high side of an inherently difficult calculation.\" Pollack pointed to a 2009 study by Richard Kronick, then a University of California San Diego medical professor who later went to work for the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. His study concluded that the risk of mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance. Uninsured individuals can still get some health care, but they use fewer services than the insured, which increases their risk, said Jonathan Oberlander, who studies health care politics and policy at the University of North Carolina. \"There are different estimates in the literature of how much uninsurance increases mortality (and at least one significant study that doesn\u2019t confirm that claim),\" Oberlander told PolitiFact. \"But in general I\u2019d say that former Gov. Crist is on solid ground in saying that Florida's decision to not expand Medicaid could lead to more deaths from uninsured Floridians, which could have been reduced if the state expands Medicaid. However, getting an exact number is difficult. There are estimates, and the Health Affairs study is just one estimate.\" Some of the criticisms we heard focused on shortcomings of the underlying studies. George Washington University professor Leighton Ku said that the Sommers/Baicker study looking at the mortality in a few states was \"relatively rigorous\" but warned that it came with caveats. The authors wrote acknowledged that it may not be possible to generalize its findings to other states. Also the study states that it \"cannot definitively show causality.\" \"It makes sense to believe that giving low-income people Medicaid health insurance coverage will lead to improved health access and improved health and could eventually reduce mortality,\" Ku told PolitiFact in an email. \"But it is important to recognize that it might take a number of years before such an effect is realized.\" Ku said that the new Medicaid death study \"is somewhat speculative, but plausible. It did not go through the more rigorous peer review that would normally be required to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. I think there is pretty good evidence that Medicaid saves lives, but how many and how long it takes is a little harder to say.\" Other scholars are more critical of the study. Duke University professor Chris Conover, an adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the study of three states only found a statistically significant decrease in mortality in New York and that the New York benefits are more generous than most states. The study, he said, doesn\u2019t prove that the reasons for the differences between mortality in New York (which expanded Medicaid) and Pennsylvania (which didn\u2019t) result from differing approaches to expanding Medicaid. \"If people are willing to overlook the study\u2019s clear methodological limitations to claim it \u2018proves\u2019 Medicaid saved lives in New York, then they have to be prepared to concede that Maine and Arizona\u2019s Medicaid programs evidently had no impact on mortality,\" Conover wrote in his blog. Baicker, author of one of the underlying studies, said that the new study is \"a blog post (rather than a refereed article), so I really can't speak to the quality of methods they use.\" \"The point of most studies like this is to take estimates of the effect of a particular program and forecast what would happen to a population overall based on those estimates,\" Baicker said. \"All such estimates come with uncertainty, and don't point to the specific individuals or, for example, specific times of death.\" Our ruling Crist said that Florida\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid means that \"six people in Florida die as a result of that every day.\" The statistic is based on a recent study, but experts note a few caveats. First, Crist used the study\u2019s high-end figure; using the low-end figure cuts the number of deaths to three a day. Second, experts caution about uncertainties about the studies upon which the new study was based. And third, while many experts agree that it\u2019s plausible to assume that the lack of Medicaid coverage could lead to deaths, they were careful to add that it is difficult to pinpoint a number as precise as the one Crist offered.

        "claim": "A 1954 heatwave in the US proves climate change is not happening",
        "doc": "\"There was no 'GLOBAL WARMING' or 'CLIMATE CHANGE' agenda in 1954. The current rhetoric is only an agenda about power control and wealth redistribution,\" says a July 28, 2022 Facebook post, which includes a photo of a newspaper article. \"Stories like this are part of the reason they have backed off teaching history in public schools.\" Similar claims have circulated on Twitter here and here. As evidence, the posts cite a July 16, 2022 column in The Joplin Globe, a daily newspaper in Missouri. \"As hot as it is this summer, 1954 was so much worse,\" the headline says. But the posts misinterpret the article, which does not mention climate change. And scientists say global warming is making heatwaves more frequent and intense. \"No individual heat wave can prove or disprove global warming,\" said Maren Hale, a climate researcher at the University of California-San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In the column shared online, historian Brad Belk of Missouri Southern State University recalled his experience of summer 1954. Belk is not a scientist and did not express opinions related to climate change. Instead, he mentioned the heatwave's consequences on the local population and infrastructure. \"Whether it is 1954 or 2022, hot is hot,\" he said in the article. \"Fall was a welcome relief in 1954. Autumn 2022 will be greatly appreciated as well.\" Data from 1954 confirm the intensity of that summer in the Midwest. Nancy Westcott, a research climatologist at the Midwestern Regional Climate Center, said in a 2011 study that the year marked \"the most recent prolonged and devastating heatwave\" for the region. Illinois, for example, set a record temperature of 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47.28 degrees Celsius) on July 14, 1954 in East St. Louis. However, Westcott told AFP the report \"was on a local scale and showed no global data.\" \"It showed that climate varies regionally and that extremes in weather have always occurred, but shows nothing about what is happening globally,\" she noted. All of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the 21st century, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information. In the 143-year global record, 2022 is ranked sixth warmest for the January-July period. Hale said that, while variations may exist across regions, \"as a whole, the United States is experiencing heat waves more often, and these heat waves are more extreme and last longer than they did 60\u201370 years ago.\" Jessica Neu, an atmospheric researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told AFP that the 1954 heatwave \"does not in any way disprove that the warming of the Earth due to greenhouse gas accumulation is accelerating and is the result of human activity.\" \"You can think of it like a business that has implemented a new strategy to increase sales,\" Neu said. \"The success of that strategy will not be determined by one or two good years or bad years (like the 1954 heat wave), but rather by the long-term average change, or trend, in sales.\" The 1954 heatwave was an extreme event, she said, but climate change has \"led to increasing frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves in the US since the 1950s.\" Every additional 0.5C of warming causes discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes -- including heatwaves, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. More than 700 scientists from 90 different countries put together the report. AFP has fact-checked other claims about climate change here.",

        "doc": "Has the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) introduced a new 'Tier-0' level exam to deal with heavy traffic on its servers? This is what some social media users are claiming based on an apparent SSC notice doing the rounds. SSC recruits staff for different posts in various ministries and departments of the Government of India and in subordinate offices. For this, it conducts competitive examinations that have several stages or levels called 'tiers'. The SSC has recently published a notification for the 'Combined Graduate Level Examination, 2020'. This exam is held in four tiers - the first two online, and the rest offline. Since then, a viral notice purportedly issued by SSC is doing the rounds on social media. It says, \"In the view of increasing Load on SSC server , the commission has decided to introduce a new Tier named \"Tier-0\". This will be qualifying in nature. The Candidate can only apply For Jobs after qualifying it. Further details will be shared in due course.\" A Twitter user wrote, \"They have added a \"TIER-0\" in SSC exam. Only those students who can break through this server down stage will be eligible for TIER-1. Complete mental torture.\" India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the notice which is being circulated on social media in the name of SSC is morphed. SSC has not issued any such notice. Another Facebook user shared the viral notice with a caption in Hindi which translates to, \"While UPSC is heading from tier 1 to tier 2, SSC has moved to tier 0. I'm clueless whether this should be called a step ahead or backward.\" The archived version of this post can be seen here. Many Facebook users are sharing the notice with a dig at SSC. AFWA investigation We found that the font used in the viral notice is different from the one used in notices posted on the official website of SSC. Also, the text alignment in the viral notice is different from official SSC notices. The notice in circulation has several grammatical errors as well, which is highly unlikely in an official order. This clearly means that the viral notice is morphed and has been created using a template of an original notice issued by SSC. Even the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has called the viral notice \"fake\" and clarified that SSC has not issued any such notice. A notice allegedly issued by the SSC claims that due to the increasing load on SSC servers a new tier named 'Tier-0' has been introduced and candidates can only apply for jobs after qualifying it.#PIBFactCheck: This notice is #Fake. No such notice has been issued by the SSC. pic.twitter.com/nco7f7xw13 \u2014 PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) January 6, 2021 No mention on SSC website We did not find any such notice about the introduction of 'Tier-0' level examination on the official website of SSC. While the viral notice is dated January 3, 2021, the last notice on the SSC website was issued on January 1. This notice is related to the last date for submitting online applications for 'Combined Graduate Level Examination, 2020'. Speaking to India Today, an SSC official confirmed that no such notice related to introduction of 'Tier-0' level in the examination has been issued by SSC till now. Coaching centres clueless about viral notice SSC aspirants and coaching centres who closely follow latest developments and news related to the exam have also not heard about such a notice. A faculty in one such SSC coaching centre in Delhi, Baljeet Kaur, told AFWA, \"As the last date for submitting online application approaches, many a times the server crashes. Due to this, at times, the last date is extended. But it is really strange that people are sharing such morphed notices. This creates confusion among students.\" Thus, it is clear that a morphed notice is being circulated in the name of SSC. The commission has not come up with any such order about introduction of a 'Tier-0' level in the examinations to deal with increasing traffic on its servers. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Due to increasing load on Staff Selection Commission servers, a new 'Tier-0' level exam has been introduced and candidates can only apply for jobs after qualifying it. Conclusion The notice which is being used as evidence to the claim is morphed. No such order has been issued by SSC.

        "doc": "Update: official UK guidance on how to avoid catching or spreading the new coronavirus has changed since we first wrote this article. You can read the latest advice on the NHS website here . A series of different Facebook posts shared thousands of times between them on social media make a number of claims about the symptoms of Covid-19 and ways to prevent the disease. The majority of these claims are inaccurate, and have the potential to cause harm. Although some of the advice in the posts, such as washing your hands, is factual and important for people to follow, claims about cures for the virus or symptoms which mean you definitely do not have the new coronavirus are misleading and false. This advice could be harmful if it is followed instead of the official NHS guidance . We checked another version of these posts previously, which was later edited to alter some of the more inaccurate claims. The series of identical Facebook posts this article refers to have not been edited and are still sharing incorrect information. The posts all claim the information originated from someone working at Shenzhen Hospital in China. \"If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold.\" Having a runny nose and sputum (phlegm coughed up from the lungs) does not mean that you do not have Covid-19. Early studies suggest a runny nose is a relatively uncommon symptom, but some patients did have it. Another study suggests it could be more common, and the World Health Organization (WHO) includes it in its list of possible symptoms. The main symptoms of Covid-19 are a new, continuous cough and a high temperature. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) says \"sputum production\" is a less common, but still reported, symptom. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February found a third of patients with the new coronavirus were producing sputum. \"Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.\" Pneumonia\u2014which describes the swelling of lung tissue and is usually caused by a bacterial infection\u2014has been seen in Covid-19 patients. One of the most common symptoms is a dry cough . However, as we said previously, having a runny nose does not rule out having the new coronavirus. \"This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.\" As the new coronavirus is still so new, there is a lot that is still unknown about it. You should be wary of sources that claim to have such specific details so soon after the discovery of a virus. We do not know what temperatures SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can withstand. Studies have found that another coronavirus, MERS, was more stable at lower temperatures and a warmer, humid environment slowed its transmission. The WHO says coronaviruses in general\u2014which includes MERS, SARS and the common cold\u2014can be destroyed at cooking-levels of heat, at around 70\u00b0C. Going in the sun is unlikely to protect you from Covid-19. Some of the countries with confirmed cases have warm climates, where the temperature is regularly above 27\u00b0C. We've written more about how viruses react in warmer climates here . \"If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.\" There is no evidence that the virus which causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, spreads differently to other coronaviruses. Other coronaviruses can be transmitted by droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, but it is difficult to say exactly how far droplets spread when you sneeze. The distance they travel can be impacted by a range of factors including humidity and temperature. Research from MIT has suggested droplets can spread several metres from the sneezing person. The NHS recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve, but not your hands, when you sneeze. You should put tissues in the bin and wash your hands afterwards. \"If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours \u2013 so if you come into contact with any metal surface \u2013 wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.\" No one knows how long the virus that causes Covid-19 can survive on surfaces yet. A new study in America, which has not yet gone through the peer-review process to ensure accuracy, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable on cardboard for up to 24 hours and for two or three days on plastic and stainless steel, although its strength was \"greatly reduced\". However, the researchers noted that future experiments should test how viable the virus is when it is spread from nasal secretion or sputum, and in varying environmental conditions rather than a lab. The WHO says : \"Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the Covid-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. \"This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature of humidity of the environment.\" \"On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent will kill it.\" The UK government has advised people staying at home because of suspected Covid-19 symptoms to use usual household products like detergent and bleach when cleaning because \"these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces.\" It adds: \"To minimise the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry. Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All dirty laundry can be washed in the same load. If you do not have a washing machine, wait a further 72 hours after your 7-day (for individual isolation) or 14-day isolation period (for households) has ended when you can then take the laundry to a public launderette. The CDC recommends people in the same household as those with Covid-19 or someone suspected of having it, or their intimate partners or caregivers, should remove and wash soiled clothing and wear disposable gloves when handling it. It says normal laundry detergent and the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label should be used. We haven't found any reliable source saying exactly how long the virus can survive on fabric. \"Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.\" We can't find any scientific evidence that warm water can cure or prevent diseases caused by viruses. Hot drinks can be a comfort to those suffering with coughs and colds. \"Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes but \u2013 a lot can happen during that time \u2013 you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.\" It is good advice to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently. However, it is not clear how long Covid-19 can survive on your hands, especially not down to the minute. The post is right to mention that rubbing your eyes, mouth or nose without washing your hands can be a problem, as these are prime entry points for viruses and bacteria. \"You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.\" Other fact checkers have also written about this claim, which was attributed to respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, a key figure during the SARS outbreak. The hospital where he worked debunked the rumour via a post on social media site Weibo. Gargling with salt water is recommended by the NHS for adults who have a sore throat , but only to relieve symptoms once you have caught it, not as a preventative measure. The WHO has said that there's no evidence saline can prevent Covid-19. \"Can't emphasise enough \u2013 drink plenty of water!\" We've previously checked claims that drinking water will prevent you catching the virus, or cure you if you have it, and found they were incorrect. The WHO has said : \"While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\" \"THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.\" This is a roughly accurate description of the common symptoms of Covid-19. Some patients may experience other symptoms, and the timings may differ. The CDC says a sore throat is one of the \"less commonly reported respiratory symptoms\". The most common symptoms are a fever, cough, muscle pain and shortness of breath, as the post claims, but not everyone who has Covid-19 will get pneumonia. The NHS does not mention nasal congestion that 'feels like drowning' as symptom of the new coronavirus. New advice published on 18 May now says that anyone experiencing loss of taste or smell (known as 'anosmia') should also self-isolate. If you experience either of the two major symptoms of Covid-19 the NHS says to look out for (a high temperature or a continuous cough) you should stay at home for seven days and you do not need to contact their 111 service. If your fever is gone after seven days you can return to your normal routine (even if you still have a cough), but if you still have a fever remain at home until your temperature returns to normal levels. If these symptoms don't go away after seven days, if you can't cope with them at home or if you get worse then use the NHS online 111 coronavirus service . If you can't get the help you need there then you should call the 111 phone service. If you have a medical emergency, you should still call 999 as you would normally. We've written more about what you should do if you think you have the new coronavirus, and what anyone you live with should do, here .",

They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck,\" she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. \"You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself.\" Norton says in the ad.\"Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff,\" Norton continues. \"Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground.\"The \"shady interest group\" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. Here's their ad:\"Our country is at the brink,\" a narrator says. \"Colorado families and workers need relief -- yet Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions. And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs. Call Jane Norton, tell her no more tax hikes and big government spending.\"Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from national Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement.There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this report, we're fact-checking the claim about Norton growing state bureaucracy; we also fact-checked whether she supported \"the largest tax hike in Colorado history.\" And we're examining Norton's charges against Buck in still another report.Americans for Job Security said that \"the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years.\" The group -- a business league that's not required to disclose its donors -- based its claims on Norton's tenure as executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment from 1999 to 2002. Norton was appointed by then Gov. Bill Owens, also a Republican. The department is in charge of public health, as well as things like air quality and nursing home regulations.Under Norton's tenure, the budget did grow from $226 million to $269 million. But most of that increase came from federal funds or cash funds from things like user fees. State funds to the department increased for a few years but then declined. Over Norton's entire tenure, state funding dropped from $23.7 million to $16.2 million.Finally, we should note that some people don't believe a state agency director has that much control over the amount of money an agency receives from the state. The reduction in state funding was part of large-scale budget cutting during a year of low tax revenues, according to a review of Norton's tenure at the Public Health and Environment Department in the Denver Post.The Americans for Job Security ad said that \"the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years.\" The ad leaves out the fact that state funding was lower at the end of her tenure than it had been at the beginning.

        "claim": "Photo shows road accident which killed 7 people during 2022 Eid holiday in Indonesia",
        "doc": "The link to the blog article -- with the photo as a thumbnail -- was shared on Facebook here on May 1, 2022. Translated to English, the post's caption reads: \"Verily we belong to Allah, this happened this afternoon, 7 people who were going home for Eid al-Fitr died in an accident! Three of them belonged to one family, died on the way to the hospital.\" The blog post published in April 2022 has the same headline, but the content of the article purports that one person died in the crash involving three vehicles. The Indonesian-language blog post reads, in part: \"Three vehicles were involved in an accident in front of the Mitra Iron Shop on Friday, April 29, 2022. One motorcyclist died at the scene with serious head injuries. \"This traffic accident occurred on Godean-Ngapak Road. The exact location was in front of the Mitra Iron Shop, Godean district, Sleman regency, Yogyakarta.\" The posts circulated as tens of millions of Indonesians travelled to their hometowns on April 28, 2022 on an annual exodus from Jakarta and other major cities before the Eid al-Fitr holidays, which fell on the first week of May this year, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The yearly homecoming journey -- locally known as \"mudik\" -- had been stalled for two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The misleading blog post, as well as the photo, was also published on Facebook here and here. Other blog posts used the same photo alongside a similar claim here, here and here. However, the claim is false. AFP found the photo has circulated in news reports about an earlier traffic accident in Indonesia on June 11, 2021; the blog posts also include details from another car crash on August 17, 2021. A reverse-image search on Google found the photo published in this report by Indonesian news outlet iNews on June 12, 2021. The report states the accident involving three cars and two motorcycles took place in West Bangka regency, on Bangka-Belitung Islands, a province off the east coast of Indonesia's Sumatra Island. Part of the report reads: \"A multiple-vehicle collision occurred on Pangkalpinang-Muntok Road, West Bangka regency, involving three cars and two motorbikes. In this incident, the victims only suffered minor injuries. \"The accident in Dendang village, Kelapa district, happened on Friday afternoon, June 11, 2021.\" The photo in the report was taken by an iNews journalist and has a caption that reads: \"The car and motorcycles involved in the multiple-vehicle collision in West Bangka.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the photo in the iNews report (R): The accident was also reported by other local media here and here, with photos that match the picture in the iNews article. Meanwhile, the details of the accident in the misleading blog posts actually correlate to a deadly car crash in Yogyakarta, a province on Indonesia's Java Island, on August 17, 2021. Text from the blog posts partially match a news report published by regional outlet Baca Jogja on the same day. Translated to English, the genuine news report's headline reads: \"One Dies in an Accident Involving Two Motorcycles and One Car in Godean, Sleman.\" Godean is a district located in Sleman regency, in the northern part of Yogyakarta province. The report also states the accident took place in front of the Mitra iron shop, and includes other details mentioned in the misleading blog posts, such as the make of the vehicles involved and comments from the same local police inspector. The accident in Sleman was also reported by iNews on the same day here. Neither accidents in West Bangka nor Sleman happened during Eid al-Fitr holidays, which fell in mid-May in 2021.",

        "claim": "Old video clips that went viral most recently in August 2023 depicted an authentic alien autopsy.",
        "doc": "About this rating The clips were of a staged autopsy captured in London by, among others, film producer Ray Santilli. In August 2023, clips from a strange, black-and-white videorecirculated on social media, allegedly depicting an authentic, space alien autopsy. \"Here is another leaked alien autopsy video,\" one social media user captioned one of the viral videos. \"It is believed this is footage from an autopsy on the aliens recovered from the UFO crash in Roswell New Mexico,\" the caption continued. (Twitter user @CosmicMysteryX) \"I hope it's not real. Too bad for the alien,\" one TikTok user captioned another similar-looking clip. Reverse image search results showed that the clips had been shared on various websites, manyclaimingthey proved the existence of aliens in Area 51. We tracked down the source of the viral clips, and it turned out the autopsy was staged. The video clips originated from a film released in 1995 byRay Santilli, which at that time claimed it showed an authentic, alien autopsy. A Time magazine article from that time read: The 17-minute film, silent and in muzzy black and white, has enough implicit melodrama to fill a satisfying sci-fi epic. But some people believe, or hope, that it may be genuine--evidence of an alien life form on earth, conceivably connected with the report (and alleged government cover-up) of a UFO crash near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Professional skeptics find the film a clever or clumsy hoax. Others believe it's real, but not from Roswell. The UFOlogical combatants duel it out in magazines and on the Internet while poring over the footage with an intensity not lavished on any home movie since the Zapruder film. Moreover, in 1995, FOX Network television aired a documentary investigating the footage allegedly filmed by the U.S. military after the legendary UFO crash near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. In the film, Santilli claimed it was a real alien autopsy. What's more, experts from various fields asserted the creature in the video did not look human and underscored how difficult it would be to create such a fake. The truth about the video's nature was revealed in theEamonn Holmes documentary from 2006 \"Eamonn Investigates: The Alien Autopsy\": For more than 10 years now that piece of film has divided opinion across the world. Some said it's an irrefutable proof of alien life on another planets. Some say it's the greatest hoax of all time. Well I'll let you in on this secret. It's a fake. But maybe not all of it. In the Holmes documentary, Santilli referred to the production as a \"reconstruction\" of a real alien autopsy film he viewed in the early 1990s, confirming that it was not a recording of an actual event. Importantly, however, Santilli has never provided evidence of the autopsy on which he allegedly based the reconstruction. The staged film was captured in a small flat in London converted into the set for the autopsy, and Santilli claimed thatmaterials used came \"from all over the world.\" John Humphreys, who is also interviewed in the film, was responsible for creating the creature from scratch, and said it took him over three weeks. Moreover, Humphreys confessed that the brains visible in the video were not alien brains, but sheep brains covered in jelly. \"The body was cut up into small bits and burnt,\" he explained to a journalist about the disposal of the rest of the body. Given that viral videos were actually clips from a film by a producer who admitted that it was a reconstruction, we have rated this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\" As of the time of this writing, there was no evidence of the footage Santilli allegedly based the reconstruction on. Additionally, one of the videos shared on social media was a clip from a humorous film based on Santilli's story. ",

        "doc": "On January 18, Aam Aadmi Party announced Bhagwant Mann as its chief ministerial candidate in Punjab ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in the state. In this backdrop, a video has surfaced on social media platforms showing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal praising Mann for pledging to quit alcohol. The captions with the video suggest that Mann has promised to quit alcohol from January 1, 2022. A Facebook user shared the video with a caption, \u201cIndeed Bhagwant Mann has given the biggest sacrifice in political history for people of Punjab. He has promised not to touch liquor for 1st Jan\u2026.Strange Isn\u2019t it ??? Who else has given such Sacrifices.\u201d The video is doing rounds on Twitter with a similar caption. FACT CHECK NewsMobile fact-checked this video and found it to be shared with a misleading claim. With the help of a relevant keyword search, we found Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s speech in a news report by OneIndia Hindi uploaded on YouTube on January 21, 2019. \u201cArvind Kejriwal On Bhagwant Mann \u2018NO Drinking Promise\u2019. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, who has often been accused of drunken behavior in public, revealed on Sunday that he had given up drinking on his mother\u2019s advice. And promptly got a back-slapping endorsement from party chief Arvind Kejriwal, who called it a \u201cbig sacrifice\u201d, reads the description. On checking further, we found multiple news reports on Bhagwant Mann\u2019s pledge to quit alcohol. Mann and Kejriwal made references to this development while addressing a rally in Barnala in January 2019 in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. According to a Hindustan Times report, Mann promised to quit drinking in the presence of Kejriwal and his mother. \u201cThe Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) coalition and the ruling Congress are in cahoots to malign my image by portraying me as a born drunkard. They have stooped to the level of showing old videos to defame me. It\u2019s the only fault they find in me. Therefore, I have decided to quit drinking,\u201d the report quoted Mann as saying. AAP leader Manish Sisodia also tweeted about the same. Therefore, it can be concluded a three-year-old video is being falsely shared as recent ahead of the Punjab assembly elections.

        "claim": "\"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are. \u2026 Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing.\"",
        "doc": "As the Congressional Budget Office prepares its assessment of the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the White House is already casting doubt on the agency\u2019s credibility. During a segment on ABC\u2019s This Week, White House Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney pointed to the CBO\u2019s track record on the ACAas evidence that the agency isn\u2019t capable of assessing a large piece of legislation. \"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are,\" Mulvaney said March 12. \"So, I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard. They do. Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing.\" This talking point has been popping up a lot in the last week. Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, painted a less-than-rosy picture of the CBO\u2019s track record on Fox News Sunday on March 12. In addition, at a March 8 press conference, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, said \"If you\u2019re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you\u2019re looking in the wrong place.\" Mulvaney has a point that the CBO\u2019s projections for how many people would gain coverage through the ACAwas higher than reality, but that criticism isn\u2019t enough to undermine its ability to analyze the Republican repeal-and-replace bill. CBO predictions versus reality The CBO \u2014 the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress \u2014 released enrollment projections for the health care law in March 2010. It estimated that 21 million people would purchase coverage through the new insurance exchanges by 2016. At the end of 2016, more than 11.5 million individuals actually signed up for 2017 coverage, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That\u2019s a difference of 9.5 million enrollees, even more than the figure Mulvaney provided. It's also possible Mulvaney was referring to CBO's March 2010 estimate ofthe reduction in the number of uninsured people. The CBOpredicted 30 million fewer people would be uninsured in 2016 because of the ACA. However, in March 2016, the CBO reduced its estimate of the same quantity to 22 million. That's a difference of 8 million people on the mark. Still, experts said CBO\u2019s forecasts were reasonable at the time. \"With respect to precise quantitative point estimates, the differences between CBO's estimates and actual experience are well within the range that I would expect given the scope of the change CBO was being asked to analyze,\" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. Fiedler also noted that CBO's \"big picture\" assessment of the impactof the ACA on insurance coverage was on point. Specifically, the agency estimated a significant decrease in the number of people without health insurance that would leave the uninsured rate at a historic low, which is what occurred, he said. In addition,the figure ignores the fact that the 2010 predictioncouldn\u2019t accountthe Supreme Court decision about Medicaid expansion thatallowed each state to decide for itself. Nineteen states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility. According to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, the CBO overestimated enrollee total, but still offered projections closer to reality than four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group). Importantly, the CBO reduced its projection of how many people would get health insurance this year through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces, from 21 million to 13 million. Initially, CBO analysts believed exchange enrollment would be higher in part because employers would drop insurance plans in favor of the marketplaces. That has not occurred. \u2018They\u2019re not capable\u2019 Just because the CBO overestimated one measure of the Affordable Care Act in the past is not a reason enough to believe that they will miss in the same direction in the future, Fielder said. In fact, the CBO continuously adjusts their projections to incorporate new data, research, and experience, so if anything they shouldn\u2019t repeat the same mistakes. With respect to the House bill, the CBO has the advantage of having just seen how implementing the ACA impacted insurance coverage. \"That experience will be particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of rolling back provisions of the ACA, meaning that, if anything, one should probably expect estimates of this legislation to be more accurate than CBO's estimates of the effects of enacting the ACA,\" Fielder said. No prediction will ever be perfect, but for the most part, experts who have studied the CBO have found their projections to be largely sound. For example, the National Tax Journal in 1988 concluded that short-run projections from the CBO do not contain bias. A 2000 report comparing the forecasting of the CBO and the Federal Reserve Board concluded that, \"The most accurate forecasting is done by the CBO, with the Fed a close second.\" Even the CBO released its own report in November 2015 that looked at how accurate their predictions have been, as well as what factors have contributed to forecasting errors. On average, between 1982 and 2014, the CBO overestimated two-year revenue forecasts by 1.1 percent and six-year projections by about 5.3 percent. Our ruling Mulvaney said, \"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are.\" Mulvaney went on to say that the CBO may not be capable of assessing the GOP\u2019s replacement plan. The initial CBO analysis of the Affordable Care Act did forecast that more people would participate in health care exchanges than actually did, but the CBO has revised those estimates. Moreover, independent analyses, as well as experts agree that the CBO offers some of the best estimates given the information available at the time. Mulvaney\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but misses context that would give readers a different picture of the CBO. We rate this claim Half True.",

The litigation centers on California\u2019s handling of state voter rolls, which contain a large number of voters who are considered \"inactive.\" Registered voters may be rendered inactive if official election materials like a mail ballot or voter guide are sent and returned as undeliverable. According to our friends at Snopes, estimates do show some California counties list more registered voters on their rolls than eligible adults, though some argue the methodology underlying this count is dubious. The merits of the legal arguments are beyond the scope of this fact-check. What\u2019s key here is that the Facebook post misses the critical distinction between inactive voters and fraudulent votes. Judicial Watch argues that retaining inactive voters on the rolls poses a voting fraud risk.

The User Agreement does warn sellers not to \"provide false, inaccurate or misleading information\" under its restricted activities section. But that is included in a list of activities prohibited in connection with \"use of our websites, your PayPal account, the PayPal services,\" and it\u2019s listed alongside other prohibited activities such as selling counterfeit goods and sending or receiving fraudulent funds. If fines are levied, it\u2019s for \"administrative costs incurred by PayPal to monitor and track violations, damage to PayPal\u2019s brand and reputation and penalties imposed upon PayPal by its business partners\" as a result of a seller engaging in illegal or fraudulent activity, according to PayPal. Also, it\u2019s not a new or reinstated policy. A PayPal spokesperson told PolitiFact that has been a longstanding provision in its User Agreement for several years. The provision is in each version of the agreement going back to at least 2013. The confusion began in early October, when PayPal said it mistakenly published changes to its Acceptable Use Policy that it later described as inaccurate. The changes said that misinformation was a prohibited activity on the site and users would be fined $2,500 for violations. \"PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy,\" the company said in an Oct. 8 statement sent to news outlets. We rate the claim that PayPal has \"reinstated its policy to fine users $2,500\" for \"spreading misinformation\" False.",

Fact: The original video uploaded by \u2018Aaj Tak\u2019 on YouTube on 19 April 2016 with the title \u201cSix killed in road accident in UP\u201d shows the visuals of injured people. Six persons were killed, and 12 others seriously injured when a Maruti car lost control and rammed into a gathering on the roadside in Devariya (Deoria) of Uttar Pradesh. However, visuals of injured people are replaced with an image of dead rats scattered around a toy car in the viral post. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. We searched the YouTube with relevant keywords and found the original video uploaded by Aaj Tak on 19 April 2016 with the title \u201cSix killed in road accident in UP\u201d. At 0:14 seconds, the visuals in this video show people injured in the accident and a damaged car.

        "claim": "A map shows Donald Trump with 410 electoral college votes to Joe Biden's 128 before Dominion servers were seized in Germany",
        "doc": "Wrong Numbers Do \"actual results of the election\" show Donald Trump winning the Electoral College with 410 electoral votes to Joe Biden's 128 votes? No, that's not true: December 8, 2020, was the deadline for states to certify their 2020, election results. Based on those official tallies, Biden is projected to win with 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232 when the Electoral College meets December 14, 2020. A candidate must receive at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The claim was made in a Facebook post (archived here) published, December 8, 2020, which began \"This is the actual results of the election.\" It continued. People in Germany saw this before Dominion servers were seized. This will probably get removed so share as much as possible. The fraud is massive. Shame on these people. This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Wed Dec 9 20:05:08 2020 UTC) The Facebook post includes a map of the United States, purportedly showing the states that Biden and Trump each won and includes the logo of One America News Network, a conservative cable news outlet. The map is mostly colored red, depicting what would have been a Republican landslide. Most of the key battleground states in the 2020 presidential election, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, are shaded red. However, Biden won each of these states, according to the Certificates of Ascertainment that Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona have filed. Held in the National Archives, they include the final count candidates received, measured in Electoral College votes. Though the Electoral College vote won't occur until December 14, 2020, the deadline for states to file Certificates of Ascertainment is at least six days before. This is often referred to as the \"safe harbor\" deadline. The \"Electoral College Timeline of Events\" section of the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, website explains why states must certify their election results days before the electors' actual vote for president. The Office of the Federal Register, or OFR, is part of the National Archives, and \"coordinates certain functions of the Electoral College between the States and Congress,\" but has no role in appointing electors. Here is the reason for December 8, 2020 deadline: States must make final decisions in any controversies over the appointment of their electors at least six days before the meeting of the electors. This is so their electoral votes will be presumed valid when presented to Congress. Decisions by States' courts are conclusive, if decided under laws enacted before Election Day. The Facebook post also claims that \"people in Germany\" saw election results showing that Trump had won the Electoral College before \"Dominion Servers were Seized.\" The reference is to Dominion Voting Systems. A Lead Stories fact check, here, found no basis for the claim tht Dominion operated servers in Germany, nor that they had been seized.",

        "doc": "In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, Tim Pawlenty describes himself as a fiscal conservative with a record of reining in government spending.The evidence: Reduced state spending growth during the eight years he was governor of Minnesota, he said.\"From 1960, the year I was born, until the time I became Governor in 2003, the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent,\" Pawlenty writes. \"We brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\"It\u2019s a statistic that he repeats several times in his book, so we decided to check it out.Pawlenty was elected governor in 2002, taking office in January 2003. In Minnesota, the budgets follow fiscal years that begin in July. So the first budget Pawlenty could have put his stamp on was the 2004 budget that went into effect on July 1, 2003.We found spending numbers dating back to 1960, and averaged the two-year increases for the general fund between 1965 and 2003. We arrived at 21.09 percent, so that\u2019s in line with what Pawlenty said.We then turned to the second part of Pawlenty\u2019s statement, that \"we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\" First, note that he\u2019s comparing two-year increments with one-year increments, which would make the difference seem more dramatic.Still, we examined year-over-year change from 2004 to 2011. (Again, Pawlenty left office on Jan. 3, 2011, but the fiscal year started six months before that.)We averaged the year-to-year changes in the budget for those years and arrived at an average increase of 1.64 percent, very close to what Pawlenty said. If you took the two-year average, it would be a bit higher, at 3.53 percent.Yet those numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story.As Pawlenty was leaving office, state budget agency released forecasts showing spending increasing 27 percent over the next two years -- before the incoming governor, Democrat Mark Dayton, made any changes to the budget at all.The budget analysts said the state had used several mechanisms to reduce state spending. That included using $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate delays shifts in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion.The budget numbers led DFLers -- that\u2019s members of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, equivalent to Democrats in other states -- to blame Pawlenty for using one-time fixes and ignoring structural imbalances.Pawlenty supporters acknowledged the anticipated spending increase but blamed it on DFLers for refusing to embrace Pawlenty\u2019s ideas for long-term solutions.Pawlenty\u2019s statement was that from 1960 to 2003, \"the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent. \u2026 we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\" The numbers are accurate, though Pawlenty is comparing two-year increases to one-year increases. More significantly, spending forecasts increased dramatically as Pawlenty was leaving office, when short-term budget fixes like the federal stimulus and spending delays for K-12 education expired. Given that increase, we rate his statement Half True.",

        "doc": "A set of three images showing apparent archaeological findings has gone viral on social media with the claim that these were excavated from Sanauli in Uttar Pradesh. A set of three images, showing apparent archaeological findings, is viral on social media with the claim that these were excavated from Sanauli in Uttar Pradesh. The first image shows a pair of wheel-like objects with what appears to be the fossil of an animal\u2019s ribcage by its side. A man can also be seen spraying something on the findings. The second image on the bottom left looks like an ancient helmet, while the third appears to be an archaeological artefact. Many netizens have claimed that these findings belong to the Mahabharata-era. Many have posted the pictures with the claim, \u201cThis is almost 1,000 years from the Mahabharata Era. A 4000 year old wooden Chariot found near Sanauli, UP, India. Wheels covered with thick plates of copper. Also copper helmets found near the Chariot. Comb, mirror decorated with camel, peacock found. This discovery has opened up a debate on the theory of Aryan Invasion in Indian subcontinent.\u201d The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be misleading. While two of the pictures are from China and United States, some elements in the post are indeed from Sanauli. Let us look into them one by one. Image 1 A reverse search led us to a \u201cDaily Mail\u201d report published in September 2011 about archaeological findings in China\u2019s Henan Province. This article carried the same image as seen in the viral claim. The report said these are \u201c3000-year-old remains of horses and wooden chariots from a Zhou Dynasty tomb in Luoyang\u201d. \u201cThe completed excavation unearthed four horse-and-chariot pits, dating back as far as 770BC,\u201d the report added. However, the Sanauli site had also gained attention for its Bronze Age solid-disk wheel carts found in 2018, which were interpreted by some as horse-pulled chariots. Image 2 While searching for the helmet-shaped object, we came across a website called \u201cDeviant Art\u201d, which carried the same image as seen in the viral post. The image here is captioned, \u201cElamite Helmet and Beaker at the Met\u201d. Using these keywords, we found the original picture of the ancient helmet, now kept at New York\u2019s \u201cMet Museum\u201d. A comparison of both images makes it clear that it\u2019s the same helmet. But there\u2019s a twist here. The rusty-looking helmet on the extreme left in black background was indeed unearthed at Sanauli. Dr Sanjay Kumar Manjul, ASI joint director and head of the excavation project at Sanauli, has confirmed the same to AFWA. He described the finding as \u201cpossibly one of oldest helmets of the world\u201d. Specifications are very similar to the helmet kept at New York\u2019s Met Museum. Image 3 The third image is also from Sanauli. Searching the Internet, we came across a video of Dr Manjul speaking about the discoveries at Sanauli in Delhi University. At 20 minutes in the video, he can be seen referring to these objects as \u201cMirror and Gold Objects\u201d found at the excavation site. Dr Manjul, however, did not make any comment on whether these findings are from the Mahabharata Era as claimed by netizens, but he told AFWA that these are indeed almost 4,000 years old. \u201cThey were a warrior class, and just like the Mesopotamians, we also had similar things such as chariots, swords and helmets. We have also found shields, a torch, daggers, copper pots, combs and a copper mirror at Sanauli, which represents a sophisticated lifestyle during that era,\u201d he added. Sanauli: Unveiling of a buried history Excavation at Sanauli began in 2005. A lesser-known place some 70 kilometres from Delhi in UP\u2019s Baghpat district, it came in the limelight after a series of discoveries. A report published in February 2020 on \u201cThe Times of India\u201d stated that a total of 126 burials have been discovered by the ASI here, in what has been termed India\u2019s largest known necropolis so far. \u201cCarbon dating marks this site as an earliest history of a warrior tribe in the Indian subcontinent,\u201d the article said quoting a report. But it is clear that all the images in the viral post do not belong from Sanauli. Two of them are from China and United States. (Inputs from Riddhish Dutta in Kolkata) INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim A 4,000-year-old wooden chariot was found near Sanauli, UP, whose wheels are covered with thick copper plates. Copper helmets, comb and a mirror decorated with camel and peacock were also found. Conclusion Although there have been remarkable discoveries in Sanauli in recent years, the chariot seen in the viral post was unearthed in China\u2019s Henan province. Reports said these are \u201c3000-year-old remains of horses and wooden chariots from a Zhou Dynasty tomb in Luoyang\u201d.

        "claim": "Detroit has \u201c2,503 dead people registered\u201d including \u201cone voter born in 1823.\u201d",
        "doc": "A graphic was shared on Facebook the day after the election suggesting that Michigan had thousands of fraudulent voter registrations, including for dead people. The image cited Fox 2 TV news and stated, \"Detroit Voter Roll Lawsuit \u2014 Filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation.\" It was followed by four bullet points made the following points: Detroit had 4,788 duplicate voter registrations, 32,519 more registered voters than eligible voters, 2,503 dead people registered, and one voter born in 1823. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As Michigan continued to count ballots, we found similar claims on social media that suggested these dead people on Michigan\u2019s voter rolls were a sign of voter fraud. On Twitter, one referred to the image as an example of \"more Detroit corruption,\" while another tweeted \"Bro the fraud is hilarious.\" The social media posts falsely suggest that the problematic registrations were tied to the Nov. 3 election. But the lawsuit was dropped months ago after elections officials took steps to clean up the voter rolls. The Fox 2 report about the lawsuit aired in December 2019. The lawsuit was filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, an organization which has filed lawsuits nationwide seeking to get jurisdictions to keep voter rolls up to date or to oppose expansions of voting by mail. J. Christian Adams, who served on President Donald Trump\u2019s defunct voter integrity commission, is president and general counsel of the foundation. In December 2019, the foundation filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Detroit alleging it failed to maintain accurate and current voter rolls. The lawsuit didn\u2019t allege that live humans impersonated dead voters and cast ballots. The lawsuit compared the state\u2019s voter file with death records and found more than 2,500 dead people, including one born in 1823, years before Michigan joined the Union. The foundation also found individuals who were registered two or three times with matching or substantially similar names, for a total of 4,788 registration files for duplicate and triplicate concerns. Six months later on June 29, the foundation dropped their lawsuit after concluding that election officials had worked to fix their voter rolls. \"Defendants have taken action on the list of likely deceased registrants provided by the Plaintiff. Further, almost all of the duplicate registrations that Plaintiff brought to Defendants\u2019 attention have been corrected,\" the foundation\u2019s lawyers wrote. We reached out to Janice Winfrey, Detroit\u2019s City Clerk and a defendant in the lawsuit, and did not hear back. When the lawsuit was dropped, Winfrey told the Detroit News that Detroit\u2019s updated voter rolls were largely a result of regular maintenance. However, Winfrey said her office looked into the allegation that one registered voter was born in 1823. \"We did do some extra digging because that is ridiculous and we wanted to see what was going on there,\" Winfrey said. \"The conclusion was that that was a typographical error.\" The fact that dead people remain on voter rolls in Michigan or any other state does not itself equal fraud \u2014 it\u2019s only a crime if someone then fills out a ballot in the name of a dead voter and sends it in. The likelihood that voter fraud can happen because of dead people on the rolls is very low, Thessalia Merivaki, an expert on voter administration and political science professor at Mississippi State University, previously told PolitiFact. \"Election administrators verify a lot of information prior to processing a ballot, be it by mail or in person,\" Merivaki said. Michigan officials said one step they take to verify ballots is signature verification. States including Michigan have significantly improved keeping their registration records up to date by joining the national Electronic Registration Information Center, which sends reports to member states showing when voters have moved within their state or out of state, when they have died and flagging when they may have duplicate registrations. It is typical to see a number of absentee votes deemed ineligible in an election, because voters die after casting their ballot. In the November 2016 election, Michigan rejected more than 1,780 absentee ballots because the voters died after they cast their votes. State elections officials previously told us that rather than indicating instances of fraud, the rejected ballots show the state\u2019s ability to detect and discount ineligible ballots. We have fact-checked many misleading claims about dead people on the voter rolls this year including in Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin. A Facebook post stated Detroit has \"2,503 dead people registered\" including \"one voter born in 1823.\" The post cites a TV news report in December related to a lawsuit filed that month by the Public Interest Legal Foundation. In June, the foundation dropped their lawsuit after they concluded that Detroit elections officials had taken action to fix the voter rolls. The person on the rolls born in 1823 was a typographical error, according to the elections office. The Facebook post misleads by suggesting that dead people on the voter rolls are tied to the current counting of ballots for the Nov. 3 election. Also, dead people on the rolls doesn\u2019t automatically mean fraud, and elections officials take steps to make sure that ballots aren\u2019t cast in the name of dead voters. We rate this statement False. This fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.",

No matter what answers are given, visitors are redirected to a screen that looks like this, inviting them to share and like the page on Facebook to claim the prize: The comment form that appears at the bottom of some of the scams is also fake: comments are automatically appearing but they do not come from real people, the whole thing is scripted: if the page is reloaded the same comments start appearing again. Clicking the share button does bring up a real share popup from Facebook but it does not share the exact URL of the page: it varies the random-looking string of letters and numbers at the end so that to Facebook it will look like a new and different article that is being shared. This makes it harder to detect and do something about it because each individual link needs to be individually reported and taken down. Clicking the like button takes people through a series of redirects via various pages, probably depending on which ads or scams the people behind the site need to promote at the time. But no prize will show up at your door in the end.

On March 23, Boulder police announced that they had arrested 21-year-old Colorado man Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, and charged him with 10 counts of murder in connection with a shooting rampage at the King Soopers grocery store on Table Mesa Drive in Boulder, on March 22. The description of Boebert \u201cfetishizing\u201d guns is a highly subjective one, and well beyond the scope of this fact check. However the meme accurately described Boebert\u2019s remarks in the aftermath of the March 2021 shooting, as well as her past record of posing for photographs holding or alongside AR-15 style guns. Initial information provided to Snopes by Boulder police indicates that the suspected shooter owned, carried and used an AR-15 style gun, or a variant thereof, but a definitive determination of the weapon used to kill each of the 10 individuals who died in the shooting will likely not be possible until ballistics testing and autopsies have been conducted. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cMixture.\u201d If relevant information becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly. On March 22, Boebert did indeed offer her prayers to those affected by the shooting, including the victims. So that component of the Occupy Democrats meme was accurate. In one tweet she wrote: My prayers are with the shoppers, employees, first responders & others affected by the shooting in Boulder. May God be with them. While we are still awaiting important information and details in this case, random public shootings & senseless acts of violence are never ok. And in another she wrote: As we continue to hear the news coming out of Boulder, I\u2019m praying for the police, first responders, and those affected by this tragedy. May God be with us as we make sense of this senseless violence, and may we unify and not divide during this time. It would perhaps be a stretch to say that Boebert regularly poses for photos with AR-15 rifles, but she has done so several times in recent years, and certainly more frequently than most Congress members and congressional candidates, and appears to have no aversion to appearing armed with, or next to, semi-automatic rifles. At a Feb. 18, 2021, virtual hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee, Boebert appeared sitting in front of a book case that visibly contained a handgun and three rifles, two of them similar in appearance to the AR-15: Democratic committee member Rep. Jared Huffman of California mocked Boebert, saying she had a \u201cshrine to [her] gun fetish as [her] Zoom background.\u201d In January 2020, while campaigning for the 3rd Congressional District seat she ultimately won, Boebert posed next to Alamosa County Sheriff Robert Jackson, holding an AR-15 style rifle, in a photograph she posted to her Instagram account: Boebert first came to prominence in 2014, when she opened Shooters Grill, a gun-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, which attracted the attention of local and national news media due to its policy of encouraging customers and staff to carry licensed firearms. Over the years, she has posed with AR-15 style guns on a few occasions, as part of efforts to promote the restaurant. In 2015, for example, Boebert was filmed firing an AR-15 style rifle on a shooting range, as part of a short online video about Shooters, produced by Barcroft Media: And in July 2019, Boebert posed at a gun show in Colorado, brandishing what appeared to be AR-15 style rifles, in photographs posted to the Instagram account of her restaurant: According to several details contained in a Boulder police arrest affidavit, provided to Snopes by the Boulder County District Attorney\u2019s office, the preponderance of evidence so far indicates that the suspected shooter owned, was armed with, and used an AR-15 style rifle, or a variant thereof, during the March 22 attack at King Soopers. The affidavit, written by Boulder police Detective Sarah Cantu and based on reports by various law enforcement officers and investigators, contains the following relevant information: The police affidavit in question states that Alissa had recently purchased a firearm which is a variant of an AR-15, several witnesses observed that the alleged assailant carried an AR-15 style gun, and a Boulder police officer reported that at one point Alissa shot at him with what he said appeared to be an \u201cassault rifle.\u201d (An AR-15 is a semi-automatic rifle, as distinct from an assault rifle, which allows the user to switch into fully automatic mode, but it\u2019s easy to see how an AR-15 or AR-15 variant could be mistaken for an assault rifle). However, definitive clarification as to the exact weapon or weapons used to kill the 10 individuals who lost their lives in the King Soopers attack will likely not be available until ballistics testing and autopsies have been conducted, and their results made public. If further pertinent information becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly. Until then, this component of the Occupy Democrats meme remains unproven, and we are therefore issuing a rating of \u201cMixture.\u201d",

        "doc": "At least one member of the president\u2019s legal team and other high-profile Trump supporters have alleged that Democrats are trying to \u201csteal the election\u201d using a super computer and accompanying software program to transfer votes to Joe Biden. Those claims have trickled down to social media posts and gone viral. One such post says that \u201cdemocrat operatives used a classified supercomputer called \u2018Hammer\u2019 to steal the 2020 election.\u201d In an interview with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business News, Sidney Powell, who is on Trump\u2019s legal team, called for an investigation into the \u201clikelihood that 3 percent of the vote total was changed in the pre-election voting ballots that were collected digitally by using the Hammer program and the software program called Scorecard.\u201d According to Thomas McInerney, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, who spoke about Hammer and Scorecard on the Two Mikes podcast last week, Hammer is a \u201ccyberwarfare tool\u201d that was \u201cconceived by the CIA to go against terrorists.\u201d Scorecard, as explained by McInerney, is an application that \u201cmanipulates votes,\u201d and, he claims, was used by Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the 2012 presidential election in order to win Florida. McInerny insists that Democrats are using this \u201ccyberwarfare\u201d in the current presidential election, targeting \u201ckey states\u201d such as: Florida, Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Last week, McInerney also appeared on Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room, where he told Bannon that Hammer \u201cwas still up and running.\u201d He claimed that the \u201cDNC has been using this tool and it has not yet been taken down.\u201d McInerney described Hammer as a \u201csurveillance tool\u201d which, he says, was modified with Scorecard, described as \u201ca software package that changes the votes.\u201d",

        "doc": "A post comparing the instances of President\u2019s rule imposed in various states during Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi tenures as Prime Minister is doing rounds on social media. The post claims that the President\u2019s rule is never imposed during Modi\u2019s tenure while the same was imposed 39 times during the tenure of Indira Gandhi. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. The archived version of this post can be found here. Claim: President\u2019s rule is never imposed during Modi\u2019s tenure as PM, while the same was imposed 39 times during Indira Gandhi\u2019s tenure as PM. Fact: As per the information available in the Parliament library and the information obtained through RTI, President\u2019s rule was imposed even during Narendra Modi\u2019s Prime Ministerial stint. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. President\u2019s Rule: President\u2019s Rule refers to the suspension of a state government and the imposition of direct rule of the Centre. In the event of the failure of constitutional machinery in the states or in cases where no party is able to form the government, the President is empowered under Article 356 to impose President\u2019s rule on the advice of the council of ministers. President\u2019s rule is also known as State Emergency. As per the information available in parliament library enumerating the events of proclamation of President\u2019s rule in states on different occasions from 1947 to 2016, President rule is imposed in three instances between 2014-16 after Narendra Modi assuming the position of Prime Minister. President\u2019s rule is imposed in Maharashtra on 28-9-2014, in Arunachal Pradesh on 26-1-2016 and in Uttarakhand on 27-3-2016. A 2019 RTI query reveals that President\u2019s rule is imposed in Maharashtra on 12-11-2019 due to political instability which was eventually revoked on 23-11-2019. Whereas another RTI query reveals that President\u2019s rule is imposed in Jammu and Kashmir due to political instability on 19-12-2018 which was later revoked on 31-10-2019. News articles about the timeline of the imposition of President rule on different occasions in different states in India can be read here and here. However, since independence, President\u2019s rule was imposed on several occasions in different states. President\u2019s rule is imposed for the first time in 1951 during Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s tenure. Overall during his tenure, it was imposed 7 times whereas during the tenure of Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister, President\u2019s rule was imposed in states on 48 occasions, highest under any Prime Minister. During the tenures of Rajiv Gandhi, PV Narshima Rao and Manmohan Singh, President\u2019s rule is imposed on 6, 11, and 10 occasions respectively. Even during the tenure of Narendra Modi, President\u2019s rule is imposed on 5 occasions. Earlier FACTLY has written stories on how many times President\u2019s rule is imposed in different states and under whose regime, President\u2019s rule is imposed the most number of times which can be read here and here. To sum it up, President\u2019s rule has been imposed on several occasions under the tenure of various Prime Ministers since 1951 including the current PM Narendra Modi.",

        "claim": "India went from 3rd largest economy to 164th fastest growing economy from 2011 to 2021",
        "doc": "Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former Union Minister Subramanian Swamy recently shared an image on Twitter stating that India has dropped from being the \"third largest economy\" in 2011 to the \"164th fastest growing nation in the world\" in 2021. A day later, Congress leader Udit Raj also made the same claim on Twitter. He wrote in Hindi, which when translated read, \"India is now the 164th fastest growing economy in the world and during Congress' regime India was at number 3. The Modi government is trying its hardest to ensure India bags the 193rd rank so it tops from the bottom.\" While both the statements in the graphic hold true separately, when used as a comparison they are misleading. Reason: While one parameter looks at the speed of economic growth (164th out of 195), the other highlights the size of a nation's economy (third largest in world). Moreover, both these aspects are measured on different yardsticks: Economic size is measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) and growth in terms of GDP at constant prices. The Press Information Bureau also fact-checked this claim and called it \"fake\" while clarifying that India is still the third-largest economy in terms of PPP. Claim: India slips to the 164th rank in the list of the fastest-growing nations in 2021, from being the third-largest economy in 2011.#PIBFactCheck \u25aa\ufe0f This claim is #Fake. \u25aa\ufe0f India is the 3rd largest economy in terms of PPP. pic.twitter.com/ZvETR8IxGT \u2014 PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 11, 2022 Fact-check Let's look at the first claim: 'India is now 164th fastest growing nation in the world'. This is based on calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices. The World Economic Outlook Database released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted a negative growth or a contraction in India's GDP (at constant prices) in 2020 by 10.3%. The database did not rank the countries though. When Factchecker sorted the predicted growth rate in descending order, India stood 165th out of 194 countries. This seems to be the basis of the first claim. However, this data is over one-and-a-half years old. Projections released by the IMF for the very next year, 2021-22 didn't display a contraction but an expansion of the Indian economy by 8.9% as the 28th fastest growing economy, and the fastest growing large economy in the world. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) said in May that India's GDP did grow by 8.7% in the fiscal year 2021-22. The IMF's prediction for India's real GDP growth this year (2022) is 8.2%. Now, the second claim: 'India was the third largest economy in 2011'. This is in terms of the Purchasing Power Parity. Swamy too, clarifies this in a reply to a comment on his tweet. 3rd largest in PPP valuation of GDP. 164 th in per capita income. Know concepts prior to pontificating. \u2014 Subramanian Swamy (@Swamy39) July 11, 2022 According to data from the World Bank, India emerged as the world's third-largest economy in 2011, from being the 10th largest in 2005. So, when isolated, the statement is correct but not the comparison. India still retains its position as the third-largest economy even in 2021, contrary to what the image claimed, in terms of purchasing power parity GDP valued at $10.3 trillion. FactChecker tried contacting both Raj and Swamy via email asking for clarification on their statements but had not received a reply by the time of publishing this fact-check. If and when we do receive a response, it will be updated here. GDP in Constant Prices and in Terms of PPP: What's the Difference? GDP represents the value of the goods and services produced by an economy in a specific period, usually measured annually. There may be fluctuations in the prices of goods and services, or the amount of goods produced and/or service output, year-on-year. To make inter-year comparisons of GDP within an economy fair, a base year is chosen and prices are fixed relative to that year. Only change in the output of goods and services is the variable in this case. If that increases, GDP in real terms increases and vice-versa. The fixed base year in India currently is FY 2011-12. The GDP is adjusted for inflation as the prices relative to that year are used. Like GDP at constant prices aids in year-wise comparison within an economy, GDP Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) helps make comparisons of GDPs between different countries. Because the GDP of each country is measured in their own currency, they are not comparable to each other. The World Bank suggests that PPPs are primarily used to convert the national accounts data of economies, such as GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency (usually US dollars). It is also used to establish international poverty lines, look into income inequality, social welfare expenditure of countries, among others. PPPs eliminate the effect of price level differences between economies and reflect only differences in the volume or output of economies. It indicates purchasing power of a nation's currency as compared to others, for a standard basket of goods and services.",

        "claim": "Taiwanese millionaire successfully gets transplanted 12-inch-long black man's penis",
        "doc": "An article titled \"Taiwanese millionaire successfully gets transplanted 12-inch-long black man's penis\" appeared on satirical website World News Daily Report. It opened: Cape Town | A Taiwanese millionaire has just fulfilled one of his lifelong dreams after a successful penis transplant from a South African organ donor. Huy Xen Phang, a Taiwanese businessman who made his fortune in the real estate industry, had been waiting for 18 months before a suitable donor was found. The penis transplantation is not only the fourth such surgery performed in the world but also the biggest known to date because of the enormous size of the penis in question. \"I am very proud of my big new penis, I don't care if people know about it, it will only make them jealous,\" Phang told reporters hours after the operation. The story was accompanied by an image that actually showed Peter Lai, a UK software engineer who died aged 60 because of a lack of resources in the NHS. Surprisingly enough the doctor and hospital mentioned in the story (Andr\u00e9 van der Merwe from Tygerberg Hospital in South Africa) actually exist this time and he has conducted an actual penis transplant according to his Wikipedia entry: Andr\u00e9 van der Merwe is a South African urologist. He is currently head of urology at the University of Stellenbosch and an associate professor at Tygerberg Hospital.[2][3] He is best known for conducting the world's first successful penis transplant in 2014.[3][4][5] He also performed the first laparoscopic kidney removal in South Africa.[6][7] There is no record however of the supposed patient \"Huy Xen Phang\" actually existing and that is entirely logical since the website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it: World News Daily Report assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. So don't fall for this hoax if you see it online.",

        "claim": "Says Democrats \"spent $40,000,000 of YOUR tax dollars trying to impeach Trump.\"",
        "doc": "Republicans have criticized the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine as an overextension of Democrats\u2019 power in Congress. On Facebook, some users take issue with another part of impeachment: the price tag. One post published Nov. 11 by a conservative Facebook page, which has more than 500,000 followers, claims the inquiry has cost American taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. \"Democrats spent $40,000,000 of YOUR tax dollars trying to impeach Trump,\" the post reads. \"But not one cent was spent to benefit citizens!\" The post, which has been shared more than 4,800 times and copied by a slew of users and pages, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The House will decide whether to impeach Trump over actions surrounding a July phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s appointment to an energy board over the next few weeks. But as for the impeachment inquiry\u2019s price tag, there is no evidence that it has cost $40 million. That $40 million figure most likely comes from an incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the cost of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The impeachment inquiry centers around actions by Trump that occurred after Mueller\u2019s investigation was completed. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard the claim that a public investigation cost $40 million. After Mueller concluded his special counsel investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, claimed during a Fox News interview that it cost \"about $40 million.\" Expenditure filings from May 2017 to 2019 put the cost closer to $32 million. The investigation was paid for through a permanent, indefinite appropriation for independent counsels. RELATED: Here\u2019s what we know about the cost of the Mueller investigation Mueller\u2019s office said indirect expenses \u2014 such as personnel from the FBI or other agencies \u2014 aren\u2019t really a use of additional tax dollars, since the personnel and resources would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation. Two notes: First, the cost of the investigation doesn\u2019t account for forfeitures made by people ensnared in the probe. The financial penalties leveled against Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, stand out among nearly three-dozen indictments stemming from the probe. As part of a plea agreement, Manafort forfeited to the government his real estate property in New York, funds in three bank accounts, and his life insurance policy. Court documents do not specify the estimated value of each asset. (Some news outlets reported that the combined value of the real estate properties could be an estimated $22 million.) Second, none of Mueller\u2019s findings have been \u2014 to date \u2014 part of the impeachment inquiry. The inquiry has solely focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine in the time period after Mueller\u2019s investigation had concluded. Tax policy experts told us they aren\u2019t sure how much the impeachment inquiry has cost since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced it Sept. 24. \"I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019s tried to calculate this cost,\" said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, in an email. We asked the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the investigation, for an estimate of how much it has spent on the impeachment inquiry. We did not hear back. One potential way to determine the approximate cost of the impeachment inquiry would be to add up the salaries of staffers on the relevant committees. According to LegiStorm, a congressional research website, salary expenditures for staffers on the Intelligence Committee totaled $2.4 million as of June. In 2018, salaries surpassed $5 million. If you factor in staff salaries for the Judiciary Committee, which will weigh in on the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation in the House, the total comes to around $5.7 million as of June. But that number still doesn\u2019t tell us a lot about the cost of the inquiry. RELATED: Fact-checking Trump, Ukraine impeachment hearings, day 1 Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense, said there isn\u2019t much congressional spending. \"All the members and staff would have been paid regardless. There are costs of transcription of the hearings, but that\u2019s about all I can think of,\" he said in an email. \"For the executive branch there are the costs of having witnesses travel from overseas in the case of Ambassadors (Gordon) Sondland and (William) Taylor (if that is the case). And there are costs for additional attorneys at the White House to work on impeachment.\" Politico reported that more than a dozen Trump administration officials have hired attorneys that typically earn between $1,000 and $1,500 per hour. But they were paid for by the Republican National Committee, officials themselves or through a legal defense fund \u2014not with taxpayer money. As for the witnesses that will appear in upcoming impeachment hearings, it\u2019s unclear what their travel expenses will be. But there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019d cost tens of millions of dollars. Past impeachments could shed some light on the potential cost. But there\u2019s not a lot to go off of. A 1998 report to Congress estimated that the cost of former special counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation of former President Bill Clinton had \"just shy of $30 million.\" The investigation, which centered on Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, resulted in his impeachment in the House. RELATED: Johnson, Nixon, Clinton, Trump: 9 questions about impeachment Later media reports placed the cost somewhere between $47 million and $50 million. Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr as head of the Office of the Independent Counsel, told the Associated Press in 2002 that about $12.5 million was spent on the perjury and obstruction probe of Clinton and his relationship with Lewinsky. But the Starr investigation lasted several years and looked into multiple aspects of the Clinton presidency, such as the Whitewater scandal. And it was independent of Congress, making it more similar to Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in 2016 (which was slightly less expensive, when adjusting for inflation) than the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine. A Facebook post claimed, \"Democrats spent $40,000,000 of YOUR tax dollars trying to impeach Trump.\" That number echoes an exaggerated estimate of the cost of the Mueller investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election. That did not go through the impeachment process. We haven\u2019t seen any estimates of the cost of the impeachment inquiry so far. Salaries for staffers on the committees involved, as well as expenses associated specifically with Clinton\u2019s impeachment charges, suggest that the cost of the Trump inquiry is far less than $40 million. They would be earning salaries regardless. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

By the 19th century, iron in Iron County, where part of the new mine would be located, had created prodigious prosperity. \"Hundreds of people are arriving daily from all parts of the country and millionaires are being made by the score,\" gushed an 1886 article in the Chicago Tribune.

(Gogebic refers to the iron-bearing region of northern Wisconsin and northwestern Michigan; taconite is low-grade iron ore.) The company is a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company headed by college dropout and Florida billionaire Christopher Cline, whose yacht is named Mine Games.The economic impact of such an investment could be big -- once the mine is up and running.An April 2011 study by an economic consultant hired by Gogebic Taconite estimated that once operating, the mine would create 2,834 long-term jobs, including 700 direct mining jobs -- with the direct jobs averaging nearly $83,000 per year in salary and benefits.Two months later, we rated Mostly True a statement from Wisconsin\u2019s largest business organization that the mine could operate for 100 years and generate billions of dollars of economic activity.There was a big hitch, however: Gogebic Taconite said it needed new regulations to provide more certainty in seeking a state permit.Republicans controlled the Legislature. But a GOP-sponsored bill to ease the state part of the state-federal permit process failed on a 17-16 vote in the Senate in March 2012. Gogebic said it was abandoning its plans.On the day after the Walker and Larson speeches, Republicans introduced a new bill, similar to the previous one. It reignited job creation claims and warnings, including some made by Native Americans near the site, about threats to water and land. Hundreds of people and extra security were on hand at the state Capitol for a Jan. 23, 2013, hearing on the bill.How long for jobs?We asked Larson spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence that it would take at least seven years under the bill for jobs to be created. She cited three things: -- A January 2013 letter from the the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which says the GOP bill might require the corps to do an environmental analysis separate from one done by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. That could add time to the corps\u2019 review process, which \"generally takes from two to four years or more,\" according to a corps timeline. -- Comments by Tim Sullivan, then-chairman of the Wisconsin Mining Association, who told state lawmakers in November 2012 it would take years to construct a mine. \"We're not talking a year or two years. You're talking five, six years out, potentially even further, depending on how the permit process goes,\" he said. -- Likely delays caused by litigation. Indeed, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, called a lawsuit \"inevitable,\" but Larson didn\u2019t cite any time frame on litigation delays. We\u2019ll also note that Gogebic Taconite itself, when first announcing its plans, said the regulatory process alone could span five to seven years.So, there are indications the permitting process could take up to seven years, but not evidence that it would take at least that long.And jobs would be created along the way.For his part, Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder, R-Abbottsford, a sponsor of the new GOP mining bill, envisions a shorter timeline. He told us the environmental review and permitting process would take about two years and that the mine could be up and running in less than two years after that.Suder also emphasized that some number of jobs would be created long before the mine opens. He said preliminary tasks would include groundwater well drilling, water and soil testing, metallurgical, hydrological and other engineering, and design for a water supply and a railroad line.DNR mining expert Ann Coakley concurred.Gogebic Taconite would need people to do environmental studies and to drill at least several hundred wells, she told us. Surface and groundwater testing would need to be done for up to two years. That and other work would need to be done in order for the company to write an environmental impact statement, which is needed to obtain permits. \"That\u2019s a large-scale undertaking,\" costing probably $10 million and likely requiring at least dozens of jobs, Coakley said.Coakley also noted that while the process for obtaining permission from the Corps of Engineers could take several years, the DNR, under the GOP bill, would have to finish its review of Gogebic Taconite\u2019s application within 420 days. If the DNR gave its permission, the company could start construction on facilities such as a wastewater treatment plant, creating more jobs.After permission from the Army Corps is granted, construction of the mine itself -- which Gogebic Taconite says would take two years and create 3,175 jobs -- could begin. Coakley said she didn\u2019t expect it would take seven years to get to that point.Our ratingLarson said a Republican-sponsored mining bill \"will take at least seven years to create jobs.\"The evidence Larson cited referred to how long it would take to open the mine, which is the when the largest number of jobs will be in play. But there\u2019s not hard evidence that it would take at least seven years to open the mine and it\u2019s clear that a significant number of jobs would be created before the opening.For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Larson a Mostly False.",

That means the last Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote left office 14 years ago, not nearly 30 as the post claims.John Kerry, his Democrat opponent, received 48.3% of the popular vote.Democrats have won the popular vote in each election since Bush\u2019s victory in 2004. Barack Obama won 52.9% of the popular vote in 2008 and 51.1% of the popular vote in 2012, Hillary Clinton won 48.2% of the popular vote in 2016 (ahead of Donald Trump's 46.1%, though Trump won the Electoral College). And Joe Biden won 51.3% of the popular vote in 2020, according to government reports.The claim is presented as criticism of the Electoral College, a group of 538 electors chosen by states' political parties that is responsible for electing the president and vice president. Each elector casts one vote, and a candidate needs 270 to win the election. Critics point to the fact that it\u2019s possible for a presidential candidate to win the popular vote and lose the election by not receiving enough electoral votes.This is what happened in 2016 when Clinton won the popular vote but not the presidency.

        "doc": "Has West Virginia\u2019s tourism industry been going gangbusters recently? Gov. Jim Justice suggested that it had. Justice wrote in a tweet, \"WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million. This is a landmark day for our tourism industry and our economy as a whole!\" WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million. This is a landmark day for our tourism industry and our economy as a whole! #WV pic.twitter.com/jjyWXYgJ15 In a follow-up tweet, Justice cited a Sept. 9 press release from his office that offered figures from 2012 to 2017 to support his claim. We decided to zero in on the first part of his assertion -- that \"WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017.\" Is that correct? Let\u2019s start with the percentage comparison. According to a West Virginia Press report published in the Herald-Dispatch, the data comes from the 2017 West Virginia Travel Impacts study undertaken by the firm Dean Runyan Associates. The study was prepared on behalf of the state tourism office. The study supports the specific figures Justice cited in his tweet. In the nation as a whole, the report said, spending by resident and foreign visitors increased by 3.0 percent over 2016. In West Virginia, by contrast, total travel spending increased by 3.9 percent. If you do the math, 3.9 percent is 30 percent higher than 3.0 percent. That said, it\u2019s worth noting a few additional bits of context. First, a chunk of these increases stem from inflation. Nationally, the inflation rate was 2.2 percent in 2017. This wouldn\u2019t affect the comparison of West Virginia to the nation as a whole -- both increases were boosted by inflation -- but it does make the 3.9 percent increase in West Virginia less impressive. Second, Justice chose to highlight the most favorable data in the report. He chose not to highlight the fact that, according to the report, local tax revenue from tourism fell by 2.7 percent over the same period, while state tax revenue fell by 1.2 percent. How about Justice\u2019s assertion that \"this increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million\"? The report shows that tourism fell by $695 million from 2012 to 2016, a four-year period. Justice\u2019s office did not respond to the data critiques we sent them. Justice said, \"WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million.\" He\u2019s right about the comparison of West Virginia and the nation as a whole, and he\u2019s also correct about the decline from 2012 to 2016. However, he engaged in a bit of cherry-picking of the data and glossed over the role of inflation in the state\u2019s tourism spending increase. We rate the statement Mostly True.",

Odinga, Kenya's former prime minister and a longtime opposition leader, is expected to run in the 2022 election. A photo more recently posted on a political Facebook group shows Kenya's second president, Daniel arap Moi, pointing a finger in conversation with a tall, tracksuit-clad man. Moi ruled for almost a quarter of a century , from 1978 to 2002. He died in February 2020. The caption reads : \"Moi elect Ruto 1991 youths leader.\" This suggests that the man in the tracksuit is William Ruto, today Kenya's deputy president . Ruto is also expected to run for the presidency in 2022. Does the photo show Moi \"electing\" a younger Ruto, back in 1991? Moi with Dawo before pivotal match in 1987 A reverse image search reveals that the man in the tracksuit is Kenya's renowned international footballer Peter Dawo . According to an October 2019 article by veteran sports writer Roy Gachuhi , the photo shows Moi speaking to Dawo before his team, Gor Mahia , met Esperance of Tunisia in the 1987 Africa Cup Winners Cup final return match, which they won .

        "doc": "During a campaign stop in St. Petersburg on May 16, 2012, Mitt Romney said he intended to make government work better and save money in the process.As an example, he cited the federal government\u2019s efforts to provide job training.\"Do you know how many federal job training programs there are? 49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies,\" he said.Romney said he would look to consolidate programs and send them to the states.\"I want to take those dollars, put them together and give them to the state of Florida and say, \u2018You create the program that\u2019s best for your own people, that puts people to work.\u2019 \"We had never heard that there were \"49 different federal jobs programs,\" so we decided to check it out.Our research eventually led us to independent reports from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a respected independent agency that investigates how the federal government spends money. The Romney campaign pointed us to the GAO as well.The agency conducted a thorough study on job training programs run by the federal government and published its findings in 2011. (The report studied fiscal year 2009.) The GAO concluded that the federal government had 47 programs run by nine different agencies, numbers very close to what Romney said.In later reports, the agency recommended that Congress look into streamlining the programs by combining administrative functions and locating different programs together at a single site.The GAO also noted that more information is needed to measure the true effectiveness of the programs.\"Almost all of the 47 programs tracked multiple outcome measures related to employment and training, and the most frequently tracked outcome measure was \u2018entered employment,\u2019 \" the agency stated. \"However, little is known about the effectiveness of employment and training programs because, since 2004, only five reported conducting an impact study, and about half of all the remaining programs have not had a performance review of any kind.\"We should note that 47 programs sounds like a lot, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean programs can be combined. It might not make sense, for example, to combine the \"Disabled Veterans\u2019 Outreach Program\" with the \"Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Program,\" or the \"Native American Employment and Training Program\" with the \"National Guard Youth Challenge Program.\"Finally, the 47 programs are not equal in size or scope. The GAO reported that seven programs accounted for 75 percent of the $18 billion spent on job training, while two programs (\"Wagner- Peyser funded Employment Service\" and \"Workforce Investment Act Adult\") served about 77 percent of all participants.Our rulingRomney said that there are \"49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies.\" The most recent comprehensive report we found on the matter found 47 job training programs under nine agencies. Also, a smaller subset of agencies account for a majority of spending on job training and number of people served. We rate Romney\u2019s statement Mostly True.

The post seems to be referring to how much MPs with dependant children can spend on rented accommodation. All MPs (except those in the London area, or who, because of their position have access to \"grace and favour\" residences) can claim back the costs of accommodation in relation to a property at one location\u2014their constituency or London. This is \"designed to meet costs incurred by MPs as a result of working from two permanent locations\". This can cover hotel accommodation, rental payments or for those MPs who own the property, associated costs like utility bills, broadband and council tax. For MPs claiming for rental costs in London, the annual allowance is \u00a323,290 , while those renting in their constituencies outside of London can claim up to \u00a316,320. However, if the MP has \"caring responsibilities\", they may have their rental accommodation budget limit increased by \u00a35,500 a year for each dependant for whom they need to provide accommodation, up to a maximum of three. The figure used in the Facebook post was the additional budget last year, at \u00a35,435 per dependant. Dependants can be children of the MPs up to the age of 18 , family members in receipt of certain benefits that they care for, or children between 18 and 21 in full time education , as long as the MP was claiming the costs of this dependant before April 2017, and the MP is their sole carer.

The exact Universal Credit payment someone will get depends on their circumstances. As well as the standard allowance (the value of which depends on whether you're over or under the age of 25, and if you are in a couple), if you have one or two children you'll get an extra amount per child. (Those with three or more children may get more but it depends on a number of other factors.)

Soon after, a video of some people thrashing a man in police presence is circulating on Facebook with the claim Sikhs in Punjab thrashed Rizvi for hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims with his petition. The caption along with one such video says, \u201c#Punjab_News Waseem rizvi beaten by Sikhs at punjab\u201d. The voiceover in the video in Kashmiri translates to, \u201cCongratulations to all Muslim brothers. Sikh brothers are beating Wasim Rizvi who filed a case in Supreme Court insulting the Quran. He had to hide inside a shop for his life with the help of the police. This is what happens to people who show hate.\u201d India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. The video shows BJP MLA from Punjab Arun Narang being thrashed allegedly by a group of farmers on March 27. The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. AFWA probe A number of Muslim groups across the country are condemning the PIL, filed by Rizvi on March 11. On March 19, hundreds of protesters and clerics from both Shia and Sunni communities protested at Delhi\u2019s Jama Masjid demanding his arrest. An FIR was also registered in Bareilly against Rizvi for hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims. However, we could not find any credible news report stating that Rizvi was manhandled either by Muslims or any other group. We then did a reverse image search of certain key frames of the video and found a longer version of the same video carried in media reports on March 28. \u201cProtesting Farmers Thrash BJP MLA, Tear His Clothes In Punjab\u2019s Muktsar,\u201d reads the caption of one such video report published by \u201cIndia Today\u201d. According to the report, the incident took place on March 27, when BJP\u2019s Abohar MLA Arun Narang went to Malout to address a press conference. He and other local BJP leaders were surrounded by a group of protesting farmers. Black ink was thrown at them and the protestors also allegedly thrashed the leaders and tore Narang\u2019s clothes. According to a report by \u201cNDTV\u201d , Malout DSP Jaspal Singh said the protesters were adamant that they would not allow the BJP MLA to hold the press conference, and hence, he was later escorted to a safer place by police. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had condemned the attack. Chief Minister @capt_amarinder Singh condemns attack on BJP MLA from Abohar, warns of strict action against anyone disturbing state\u2019s peace. CM also urges Prime Minister @narendramodi to intervene for early resolution of farmers\u2019 crisis to prevent further escalation of situation. \u2014 CMO Punjab (@CMOPb) March 27, 2021 Hence, it is clear that the man thrashed in the viral video is Punjab BJP MLA Arun Narang and not Shia leader Wasim Rizvi.

        "doc": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson has said many controversial things in the past but his recent commentary on masks raised eyebrows and accusations that his views were dangerous. On April 26, 2021, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he criticized mask mandates by making a number of outlandish claims on his show, \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d One such claim was that making children wear masks outside counts as \u201cchild abuse.\u201d In his tirade, Carlson said: As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal. Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart. Call the police immediately, contact child protective services. Keep calling until someone arrives. What you\u2019re looking at is abuse, it\u2019s child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it. If it\u2019s your own children being abused, then act accordingly. Let\u2019s say your kids school emailed you and announced that every day after lunch, your sixth-grader was going to get punched in the face by a teacher. How would you respond to that? That\u2019s precisely how you should respond when they tell you that your kids have to wear masks on the soccer field. That is unacceptable, it is dangerous, and we should act like it because it is. But too few of us have responded like that, we have been shamefully passive in the face of all of this. He also called mask-wearers liberal \u201czealots\u201d and \u201cneurotics.\u201d You can see a clip from his show here: Tucker Carlson is an embarrassment and a threat to public health pic.twitter.com/NhZoSSdR5n \u2014 The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln) April 27, 2021 Carlson added that seeing a vaccinated person wearing a mask in public was like seeing a grown man \u201cexpose himself in public.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting, put it away please, we don\u2019t do that here,\u201d he said. Tucker Carlson says wearing a mask outside is equivalent to \"watching a grown man expose himself in public\" pic.twitter.com/tPRt2Q3tDg \u2014 nikki mccann ram\u00edrez (@NikkiMcR) April 27, 2021 Carlson also told his viewers to approach people who were wearing masks outside and tell them, \u201cYour mask is making me uncomfortable.\u201d On April 27, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance saying fully vaccinated people could take their masks off at small outdoor gatherings or when dining outside with friends from multiple households, \u201cexcept in certain crowded settings and venues.\u201d Unvaccinated people should still wear masks at such gatherings. Vaccinated people should still take all precautions in indoor settings, including masking. The latest guidelines are available here. The messaging on Fox News is decidedly mixed: the channel has been airing public safety messages telling people to mask up. But Carlson has changed his tune since back in March 2020 when he said, \u201cOf course masks work.\u201d Given that Carlson expressed these views on an episode of his show, which is still available to view, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d",

        "claim": "Says New Jersey is \"losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream.\"",
        "doc": "A single football field is not an unusual sight, but try to imagine 50 of them being overrun with development -- every day.That\u2019s what the New Jersey Sierra Club says is happening daily in the Garden State. In a press release posted on its website Sept. 6, the environmental group tossed out that statistic when discussing the effects of development on flooding.\"We are losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream,\" according to the press release. \"We need to not only limit development but we need to (make) development with less pavement and impervious cover.\"PolitiFact New Jersey found that football may be alive and well, but developers in New Jersey aren\u2019t seeing as much playing time as they used to. The environmental group is right that development increases the risk of flooding, but construction activity has declined nationwide.First, let\u2019s explain how \"50 football fields\" translates into acres, and where the Sierra Club received that figure.New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel argued that the group\u2019s statistic doesn\u2019t count the two end zones. However, the National Football League identifies the \"field\" as including both end zones.Based on the league\u2019s measurements, a football field represents about 1.32 acres.Tittel also told us the statistic was based on research done by Rutgers University\u2019s Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. The latest data on open space loss available from that center comes from a July 2010 report detailing land-use changes in New Jersey through 2007.According to that report, an average of 16,061 new acres were developed in 2007, or about 44 acres per day. That level of development equates to about 33 football fields of development per day.So, based on that data, the Sierra Club\u2019s estimate is off by 17 football fields, or about one-third.But here\u2019s the larger mistake made by the Sierra Club: that estimate of 33 football fields refers to development as of four years ago.\"You can\u2019t compare \u201807 to today,\" said Dominick Paragano, president of the New Jersey Builders Association. \"It\u2019s a different economy.\"Updated statewide growth figures will be available later this fall, but data already shows a sizable decrease in development in Ocean County between 2007 and 2010, said Rutgers University professor Richard G. Lathrop, one of the authors of that land-use report. Ocean County was one of the faster-growing counties as of 2007.Two other data sets also demonstrate the downturn in development activity in New Jersey: the number of housing units authorized by building permits, and the number of construction jobs, according to federal and state statistics.Many developers aren\u2019t even focused on the sprawl-like development targeted by the Sierra Club. More builders are looking at redevelopment opportunities in urban areas, said Kevin Tartaglione, senior vice president and chief operating officer of the development division at Somerset County-based Advance Realty.Tittel argued that residential development may be down, but commercial development, highway-widening projects and infrastructure development are still under way.But with fewer development options available to landowners, the Somerset County-based New Jersey Conservation Foundation has been able to preserve more land in recent years, according to executive director Michele Byers.Whereas the New Jersey Conservation Foundation completed between 15 and 20 transactions annually in the early part of the decade, it completed about 40 in 2009 and then roughly 50 in 2010, she said.But Byers said the point behind the Sierra Club\u2019s statement is still legitimate, because the potential for development in New Jersey remains.\"We are really working hard to ramp up as much preservation as we can before we lose the opportunity,\" Byers said.On the Sierra Club\u2019s second point about flooding, the group is right. Two professors confirmed to us that development heightens the risk of flooding, because there are fewer areas to absorb the water.\"So that water has to go someplace,\" said Tulane University associate professor Stephen Nelson, who teaches a course on natural disasters.Our rulingThe Sierra Club claimed \"50 football fields\" are developed in New Jersey every day, increasing the danger of flooding. Flooding can be a side effect of development, but the group\u2019s statistic doesn\u2019t reflect the steep decline in construction activity during the past four years.Tittel argues his organization is using the most recent data available, but that still doesn\u2019t make it right.

        "claim": "U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ordered President Trump to enter the Capitol Building through the rear kitchen entrance to deliver his 2019 State of the Union address.",
        "doc": "A junk news website contributed a new, if fictional, wrinkle to the saga of the on-again, off-again 2019 State of the Union address by reporting on 31 January that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had ordered President Trump to enter the Capitol Building for the event through the back door. Pelosi had already postponed the annual address, blaming it on the protracted government shutdown that began after budget negotiations broke down over funding for Trump\u2019s border wall in December 2018. Trump retaliated by postponing an overseas junket Pelosi had planned, citing the same excuse, and vowed to find another venue in which to deliver the speech. The government reopened with temporary funding in late January, at which point the State of the Union was rescheduled for 5 February in the House chamber, where it traditionally takes place. According to America\u2019s Last Line of Defense (LLOD), which is part of a network of junk news sites that publishes \u201csatirical\u201d content aimed at raising the hackles of conservatives, Pelosi then sought to embarrass Trump by instructing him to make his entrance through the back door: Nancy Pelosi has sent a new letter to the President, this time through less \u201cofficial\u201d channels, letting him know that he won\u2019t be ushered into the House Chamber by the Master Chief of the Constitutional Watch like every other President for nearly 250 years. Instead, she instructed him to use \u201cthe back door.\u201d According to White House Propaganda Minister, Bart Slutlo: \u201cPresident Trump has been told he\u2019s an unwelcome guest, there only to fulfill his constitutional requirement to address the people before the sun sets on the Ides of March. The February 5th speech does that, so Pelosi feels she can use this as a political stunt to make the President seem weak. President Trump has assured me that he will be proudly walking the steps of the Capitol, just like Ben Franklin, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton before him.\u201d There is, of course, no \u201cMaster Chief of the Constitutional Watch\u201d (per protocol, the House Sergeant at Arms announces the President\u2019s entrance before the address), nor does anyone hold the title of \u201cWhite House Propaganda Minister.\u201d If Pelosisent such a letter, it somehow entirely escaped the attention of the mainstream media. LLOD\u2019s sites carry a clear disclaimer identifying their content as fictional: Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.

        "claim": "Says a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years.",
        "doc": "Gov. Rick Scott is using a questionable state \"study\" as evidence that the federal health care law will cost the state billions of additional dollars.In an guest editorial written for the Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, and again on Monday during a Washington, D.C., press conference, Scott cited a state analysis that says the health care law would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over the next 10 years.The money would be needed, Scott says, to pay for expanding Medicaid, a government-run health insurance program for the poor.\"As you know Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration put out their estimate of what the expansion would cost just for Florida taxpayers and it's over $26 billion,\" Scott told Washington reporters after meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.Don\u2019t believe that number.In this case, the Agency for Health Care Administration -- an agency Scott directs -- did indeed release a presentation that concluded that Florida taxpayers would be asked to pay $25.8 billion over 10 years to implement an expansion of the Medicaid system.But the state study relies on questionable or downright misleading assumptions to reach its eye-popping figure.We can\u2019t say what the cost will be to the state -- and if there will even be one. Outside groups such as the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, have estimated the additional cost to the state would be a little more than $1 billion between 2013 and 2022.The state figure, however, ignores a fundamental component of the health care law -- namely that the federal government will pay for most of the expansion.This requires a little bit of explanation, so bear with us.One of the key components of the new federal law, and one of the components that Scott and Republicans particularly dislike, is that most Americans will be required to have some form of health insurance or pay a penalty.As a result, the federal government wants to expand Medicaid coverage to cover more Americans who are poor.States, which manage Medicaid, can decide whether to expand the program or not, but to make the option enticing, the federal government offered to pick up most of the costs to cover more people.Over the past 20 years, the federal government has paid for about 58 percent of the costs for current Medicaid recipients. Under the expansion, the government would pay 100 percent of the costs for newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years (2014-16). In 2017, the federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond.Why is this breakdown so important?Because the state study ignores it completely.The state study calculates the cost of the expansion based on the federal government paying for only about 58 percent of the costs. Also, the most recent cost estimate from the state -- which was published in December -- includes revisions that only add to the theoretical state bill, according to our analysis. Among them:\u2022 In a January 2012 report, the state assumed people who are now eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled would slowly transition into the health care program over a period of three years. In the most recent report, the state said they would all enter Medicaid immediately.\u2022 Similarly, the January 2012 report concluded that just 40 percent of newly eligible Medicaid recipients would enter the system in 2014. By December 2012, the number had been revised up to 60 percent. It\u2019s hard to quantify the dollar impact on any one change based on the information provided by the state in its estimates. When we asked for details on these assumptions, Michelle Dahnke, a spokesperson for the Agency for Health Care Administration, said the state simply wanted to be as cautious as possible with its estimates. But state officials were aware that the estimates were off even as Scott repeated the numbers in Washington, according to emails obtained by Carol Gentry of Health News Florida, part of WUSF Media. The Health News Florida report noted that J. Eric Pridgeon, on the staff of the House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned the study almost immediately. On Dec. 20, three days after the study was released, Pridgeon wrote state agency officials saying that the federal revenues for Medicaid expansion are part of the Affordable Care Act and cannot be omitted. In response to criticism of the estimates, Scott spokesperson Melissa Sellers issued a statement defending them but noting, \"Others have asked AHCA to use different assumptions to calculate different cost estimates. We look forward to reviewing those cost estimates as well.\" The inflated estimates seem to be part of a pattern. Last summer, Scott claimed a Medicaid expansion would cost $1.9 billion a year. PolitiFact Florida looked into that number at the time and concluded that the estimate \"appears to be wildly high.\" We rated his statement False.Our rulingThere is no doubt that Medicaid represents a significant part of the state\u2019s budget, and that any plan to expand the system -- no matter how much the federal government pays for -- could include additional costs to the state.But rather than have a fact-based discussion about the state\u2019s responsibilities when it comes to health care, it appears that Scott and his staff are making strange assumptions to make the estimates higher than they actually will be.This is also a case where Scott cannot simply hide behind the fact that he is accurately citing a \"study.\" His office directed the analysis, and it was notified that the assumptions were questionable.Scott gets a pass on one thing: The cost to expand Medicaid is largely unknown. But using a study to say that the expansion of Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers \"over $26 billion\" is False.",

An Instagram image on the page \"truthseekersjustice\" states that an \"NHS document shows GP's to be paid an additional \u00a310 for every child they inject with a Covid-19 vaccine on top of the \u00a312.58 they already received- and Google are trying to hide it [sic].\" The text has been lifted from an article on the conspiracy news site the Daily Expose. The article in question claims that the authors have retained an exclusive document revealing that NHS doctors have been bribed into vaccinating children. However, there is no evidence of a coverup, and the text fundamentally confuses the way that the funding operates. There are currently no plans to vaccinate children between the ages of 12 to 15 years old. The exception to this is those within this age group with severe learning disabilities and neurodisabilities, or those with serious underlying health conditions which can result in immunosuppression, the NHS document reads. The conditions listed can make children far more vulnerable to serious symptoms of COVID-19. The document adds that any child which could be considered to be at risk of becoming seriously unwell with COVID-19 should be under consideration in line with guidance from the government's Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI). Aside from this group, the JCVI has said that it does not recommend COVID-19 vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds, because there is not yet enough evidence to confirm that it will benefit children and young people, who are at a much lower risk of becoming unwell with COVID-19. While some government officials have objected to the JCVI's advice, there are not yet any reports of plans to roll out vaccines to under sixteens generally. Both the Daily Expose article and Instagram post omit this information. Furthermore, the \"additional \u00a310\" mentioned is misleading, as it insinuates that doctors are directly profiting from vaccinations. Reuters highlights that NHS surgeries operate as small businesses, and the extra funding is available to ensure the service can be delivered to as many patients as possible. This does not mean that GPs are being bribed. There is no evidence that Google is trying to hide this information. While one search result is laid out In a way that looks as though it confirms the Daily Expose's claims, this information is not included in the link itself. Entering slightly different search terms will yield different results. The document is available to the public, and is not \"an exclusive.\" It is not true that doctors are being paid to vaccinate children. The post is both false and misleading. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation.

        "claim": "Says that under Mitt Romney, 89 million Americans could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition.",
        "doc": "The \"Obama Truth Team\" wants you to tell your Facebook friends: Bad things will happen if Mitt Romney repeals the Affordable Care Act.A recent image posted to the team\u2019s Facebook page pairs photos of President Barack Obama and Romney under the label \"The Choice.\" Then it contrasts two numbers. \"Number of Americans who could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition\" under Obama? Zero. Under Romney? 89 million.Obama\u2019s health care law forbids insurers from using someone\u2019s health or lack of it to \"determine eligibility, benefits or premiums.\" Romney, the Republican candidate for president, has promised an effort to repeal the law. But he says that people with pre-existing conditions, as long as they\u2019ve been insured in the past, shouldn\u2019t be denied coverage. (He introduced confusion for a day Sept. 9, 2012, when he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that, \"I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform. Of course, there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.\" But his aides quickly clarified he still meant protection just for those who had maintained \"continuous coverage.\") We wanted to know: Could 89 million people be vulnerable to insurers using pre-existing conditions to deny them health coverage under Romney?There\u2019s some support for this statistic \u2014 alongside significant caveats.The Romney planRomney\u2019s health care plan doesn\u2019t pack a lot of details, and his campaign didn\u2019t answer our requests for clarification.But he has consistently said that the Affordable Care Act should go away, and that people with health conditions who have \"maintained continuous health insurance coverage should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage.\"Democrats argue that means people who suffer gaps in coverage \u2014 after, say, a lost job \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be protected under Romney. And that\u2019s where the \"89 million\" figure comes from: a recent study of the number of people who lost insurance coverage for at least a month between 2003 and 2007.The idea is that if some of those 89 million happened to have a pre-existing condition, a gap in their health insurance could mean \"denied coverage\" later. But it\u2019s not that simple.We checked out a summary of the August 2012 study from the Commonwealth Fund, and chatted with one of its authors and several other health care experts about the accuracy of the campaign claim.\"If you take it very literally, it's accurate,\" said Pamela Short, one of the Commonwealth Fund study authors, who was a health care expert on President Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \"... It doesn't mean it would, but it could.\" Other experts were less generous.Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine National Review, called the statistic \"absurd and false.\"Here\u2019s how both of them are right.\u2022 The 89 million encompasses those with coverage gaps \u2014 not necessarily those with pre-existing conditions. Estimates of how many Americans actually have pre-existing conditions vary widely.\u2022 Even if Obamacare disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. Health experts we talked to assumed Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law \u2014 which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies \u2014 and perhaps strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market. But the group in the study is bigger than that, including those with coverage gaps of \"at least one month.\"\u2022 That same law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, only allows insurers to look back 18 months for coverage gaps of 63 days or more. But the study tallied those who had gaps over a four-year period.\u2022 The study looked at people ages 4 to 64 with public and private health care coverage. But people who qualify for Medicaid, for example, couldn\u2019t be at risk for being \"denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition.\"\u2022 Some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions before the Affordable Care Act qualified for insurance through state-run \"high-risk pools,\" an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals.So the Obama campaign claim is true only under the most literal reading of Romney\u2019s approach \u2014 that \"continuous coverage\" could mean exactly that, with no allowances even for short gaps protected under the law for many people since the 1990s. (And even then, you\u2019d have to subtract people who could take advantage of public insurance and high-risk pools.)Meanwhile, conservative health experts say that the group of reforms recommended by Romney, which focus on separating health insurance from employment, would cut down on gaps in health coverage.\"The idea is that you create a new system in which it's much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they're not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured,\" Levin said. The rulingThe Obama campaign says that under Romney, 89 million Americans could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition. Democrats point to Romney\u2019s promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act as evidence, along with Romney\u2019s statements that people should be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured.The \"89 million\" comes from a study that looked at coverage gaps, without a focus on pre-existing conditions. Some of those 89 million \u2014 those on public insurance, or whose gaps were less than 63 days or more than 18 months old, or who qualified for high-risk pools \u2014 could be protected in a non-Affordable Care Act world. That reduces the number of people who could suffer coverage denials.So while Romney would work to repeal blanket protection for people with pre-existing conditions, the claim that he could expose \"89 million\" to the possibility of denied coverage is only partially accurate, and leaves out important details.

But we've concluded that he was not making that linkage as strongly as we initially believed and have decided to change the ruling to Mostly True. The original article is archived here. We also wrote an explanation of our reporting and why we changed the rating here. During his State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, President Barack Obama offered some evidence about the nation\u2019s improving economy. He began by urging listeners to \"remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren\u2019t, and personal debt that kept piling up. \"In 2008, the house of cards collapsed,\" he continued. \"We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn\u2019t afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people\u2019s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn\u2019t have the authority to stop the bad behavior. \"It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. \"Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we\u2019ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we\u2019ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again. \"The state of our union is getting stronger. And we\u2019ve come too far to turn back now. As long as I\u2019m president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum.\" We decided to look specifically at Obama\u2019s claim that \"in the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005.\" We checked Obama\u2019s claim by using data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for compiling employment data. We found that the U.S. economy has seen 22 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, beginning in Feb. 2010. During that 22-month period, the number of jobs grew by almost 3.16 million, or about 143,000 per month. We should note that there has also been a job-growth streak for all jobs in the economy -- not just in the private sector -- but this run of positive jobs numbers has been shorter since job losses in the government sector have offset gains in the private sector for much of that time. If you include both private-sector and government jobs, the economy has seen increases in total jobs for 15 straight months, not 22. But since this isn\u2019t what Obama said, we won\u2019t consider this in our ruling. As for whether 2011 was the best job-producing year since 2005, he\u2019s right if you\u2019re counting private-sector jobs, and slightly off if you\u2019re counting all jobs. In 2011, the number of private-sector jobs rose by about 1.83 million (if you count from the January amount to the December amount) or 1.92 million (if you count from December to December). Either way, the increase in 2011 represented the highest one-year total since 2005, when the number of private-sector jobs increased by either 2.22 million or 2.31 million, depending on the time period used. If you use total jobs, the increase in 2011 was the biggest since 2006, not 2005. But here too, that\u2019s not the measure Obama used, so we won\u2019t consider it in our rating. Finally, there's another dimension. In his remarks, Obama described the damage to the economy, including losing millions of jobs \"before our policies were in full effect.\" Then he describes the subsequent job increases. This suggests that he\u2019s taking a degree of credit for the job growth, which runs counter to the reality that no mayor or governor or president deserves all the blame or all the credit for changes in employment. Our ruling Obama is correct on the numbers. By mentioning his policies, he's making a modest linkage that they deserve credit for the improvement when economists say they are just one factor.

        "claim": "This is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together.",
        "doc": "A chain email says that President Barack Obama was irresponsible to order five first-line aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together -- purportedly the first time this had been done since World War II. Readers asked us to look into the email, which raised the specter of Pearl Harbor and implied that there may have been an ulterior motive on Obama\u2019s part. So we decided to check it. (A hat tip to Snopes.com, the urban-legend website, which has also rated this claim.) Accompanied by a photograph of five aircraft carriers docked together, the email begins, \"What\u2019s wrong with this picture? The picture is of the five first line U.S. nuclear carriers docked together in one place. Just like Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. This picture was taken February 2014 in Norfolk, Va. . . Obama ordered five nuclear carriers into harbor for \u2018routine\u2019 (?) inspections. Heads of the Navy were flabbergasted by the directive but had to comply as it was a direct order from their commander-in-chief.\" It continues, \"This is the first time since WWII that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together. USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS George H.W. Bush, USS Enterprise, USS Harry S. Truman and USS Abraham Lincoln are all in port at Naval Station in Norfolk, Va., the world\u2019s largest naval station.\" Let\u2019s start with the picture. The photograph is genuine -- the five carriers were indeed docked at Norfolk Naval Base at the same time -- but the email gets much of the context wrong. The picture was taken inDecember 2012, not February 2014, as the email claims. The email is also wrong about why the carriers were there. They were not docked for \"routine inspections\" -- they were brought to shore so that crew members could spend Christmas with their families. Intercepts, adefense news blog, reported in a Dec. 20, 2012, post that the Navy \"makes a point\" of trying to give its crew a chance to spend Christmas with their families, \"and for a few days the percentage of ships underway drops to the lowest point it will be all year.\" What about this being the first time since World War II that five nuclear carriers were docked together? The quick answer is that December 2012 was not the first time since the war that five nuclear powered aircraft carriers were docked at the same place at the same time. A similar unintentional gathering took place at Norfolk in July 1997. A July 2, 1997, Associated Press article published in the Daily Press of nearby Newport News, Va., reported that \"for the first time\" all five Norfolk-based nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be \"moored at their home port.\" The Navy spokesman at the time, Mike Maus, addressed this rare grouping. \"It just worked out that way,\" Maus said. \"There was no plan to say, \u2018Let\u2019s bring all the carriers in for the Fourth of July.\u2019 Between scheduling for normal routine operations and shipyard stuff, that\u2019s how it happened to fall into place.\" The AP reported in 1997 that the Navy doesn\u2019t consider having all five carriers in port at the same time to be a security risk. \"At this particular time,\" Maus said, \"we don\u2019t really have much of a threat from anybody.\" What about Obama\u2019s role in the carriers\u2019 placement? Dictating the day-to-day locations of aircraft carriers is \"not really something the commander-in-chief deals with,\" said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org. Our ruling A chain email says Obama ordered five aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together in 2014, supposedly the first time this had been done since World War II. But the rendezvous occurred in 2012, a similar grouping happened at the base in 1997, and it was done so that naval personnel could be with their families for the Christmas holiday -- not for nefarious reasons that posed a security risk. We rate the email\u2019s claims False.",

        "claim": "Says the 2012-13 state budget \"leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund.\"",
        "doc": "In a recent New Orleans appearance, Texas Gov. Rick Perry recapped legislative action back home balancing the 2012-13 state budget while, he crowed, leaving billions in reserve.Perry told the Republican Leadership Conference on June 18: \"To preserve our job-friendly climate, the Texas Legislature didn\u2019t raises taxes this last legislative session while balancing their budget and maintaining essential services. And I might add, that new budget leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund.\"Some of what Perry celebrated isn\u2019t at issue. Lawmakers must balance each budget; it\u2019s a state constitutional requirement. Also, the GOP-steered 2011 Legislature never considered a tax increase.Whether the resulting plan maintains essential services is subject to debate; time should tell.For this article, we wondered if Perry\u2019s correct that the budget will ultimately leave $6 billion in the state\u2019s so-called rainy day fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office. The fund is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes.Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget that runs through August.But there\u2019s a catch, potentially a biggun.Republican leaders acknowledge the budget signed into law by Perry under-funds the state\u2019s projected share of Medicaid costs by an estimated $4.4 billion. A summary portion of the budget says that\u2019s the amount the state expects the program to need in supplemental state aid in 2013. Also, the new budget includes a kind of IOU by deferring a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts from the end of the 2013 fiscal year to fiscal 2014.In separate interviews, the chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and House Appropriations Committee agreed that $6.4 billion should accumulate in the fund over the next two years. But, they said, lawmakers will have designs on those dollars when they meet to start writing the next budget in January 2013.\"There\u2019s going to be a demand on the\" fund, said Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan. \"I decided to use it as a backstop.\"Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, said the $6 billion-plus \"is reserved for future spending\" because of the estimated Medicaid shortfall and the possibility lawmakers will restore school district payments to their usual schedule. \"We kicked the ball down the road,\" Pitts said.From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, Ogden said, \"I feel good.... From a truth-in-budgeting standpoint, we should have gone ahead and committed\" money from the fund.Caveat: Pitts and Ogden noted that fiscal expectations could change considerably before legislators confront the next budget. The state\u2019s economy could grow faster than the comptroller projects, Medicaid demands could fall short of the state\u2019s latest forecasts, Congress could even change what it expects states to fund.Of course, the reverse could also happen, ratcheting up the state\u2019s fiscal obligations.So, as Perry says, lawmakers left $6 billion in the fund. However, if projections hold, that money looks likely to be sucked up in 2013 to make up for this year\u2019s legislative decisions to under-fund Medicaid costs and postpone a payment to school districts.Broadly, Perry\u2019s statement leaves the misimpression that Texas state government is sailing along without financial frets.

        "claim": "\"50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college.\"",
        "doc": "Proposed education appropriations legislation from the Republican-controlled U.S. House would cut Pell Grant funding in fiscal 2017 by $1.3 billion to $21.1 billion. Despite the overall funding cut, Pell Grant maximum amounts are due to rise in the 2016-2017 award yearto $5,815 from $5,775 in the 2015-2016 award year. Pell Grants, started by Congress in 1972, are awarded to financially needy students who haven\u2019t yet earned a bachelor\u2019s or professional degree. The proposed funding \"cut\" is because some -- like Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who chairs the House subcommittee that drafted the legislation -- says the Pell Grant program has been running a surplus for years and that money would be better spent elsewhere. Yet the proposal drew rebukes from education groups and more than 100 Democratic members of Congress. While there is a $7.7 billion surplus in Pell dollars, Kelly McManus of the Education Trust, a Washington-based group focused on academic achievement by students that has registered opposition to the proposed reductions, said that money should be devoted to providing grants to more students. Opponents of the proposed cuts include retiring U.S. Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Mercedes, who tweeted in June 2016: \"50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college: 1.usa.gov/1WNY90D #ProtectPellhttps://twitter.com/USRepRHinojosa/status/743577402299777024\" We wondered if Hinojosa got it right that half of Hispanic students lean on Pell Grants for college. Emails to his office went unanswered.But a web search led us to a 2011 report by Mark Kantrowitz, author of \"The Distribution of Grants and Scholarships by Race,\" a report tracking Pell Grant distributions by race and ethnicity based on data collected for 2003-04 and 2007-08 about how students and their families paid for postsecondary education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is conducted every three to four years by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which draws on administrative records plus parent and student interviews At the time of Hinojosa\u2019s tweet, Kantrowitz told us by email, the most recent available data were from 2011-2012. Otherwise, Kantrowitz advised, data covering 2015-16 will available in 2017. So, what do the latest numbers show about the share of Hispanic students getting Pell grants? According to the 2011-2012 NPSAS data, 50 percent of Hispanic undergraduates received a Pell Grant that year; the average award to those students was $3,500. At our request, Kantrowitz did his own analysis of the 2011-2012 counts of grant recipients using race/ethnicity -- setting aside foreign students -- and looking at all recipients of a federal Pell Grant during 2011-2012. Kantrowitz told us: \"50.8% of students in the Hispanic or Latino category received federal Pell Grants, compared with 33.7% of students in the White category and 62.7% of students in the Black or African American category. If I group together all the minority students, 53.7% of minority students received Pell Grants.\" In recent years, the share of Hispanic students drawing the grants has surged, according to a custom report compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics for PolitiFact that showed Hispanics, excluding Puerto Rico, had sat in the mid- to high-20s for percent with Pell Grants through the 1990s. The biggest jump was between 2007-2008 and 2011-2012, when the number of Hispanics receiving the grants increased from 35.7 percent to the 50 percent mark. Wondering why the percentage of Hispanic students getting grants has surged, we reached out to Deborah A. Santiago with Excelencia in Education, a D.C.-based nonprofit organization that says it \"accelerates Latino student success in higher education.\" Santiago said by email that the increase in Hispanic students receiving grants tracks with a 30 percent increase in Hispanic enrollment in higher education between 2008 and 2012. That spurt, Santiago said, included a 4 percent uptick in Hispanic enrollment in four-year institutions, which are typically more costly to attend than two-year schools. Santiago agreed too that the Great Recession helps explain the increase \"since incomes decreased and more who could not find jobs enrolled in higher education,\" she said. And did other ethnic groups experience similar spikes? Black students did. Per the NSPAS data, nearly 62 percent of such students got grants in 2011-12 compared with 46 percent in 2007-2008. The figures show that in 2011-2012, 33.5 percent of white students received Pell Grants valued at an average of $3,300, while 61.9 percent of black undergraduates received Pell Grants at an average of $3,400 per scholarship. About 34 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander undergraduates had Pell Grants at an average of $3,800 each -- but they also had the highest average price of attendance at $20,000. But Hispanic Pell Grant recipients had the lowest rate of student loans, with only 50.1 percent having student loans compared to 64.7 percent of white Pell Grant recipients and 65.8 percent of black grant holders. Our ruling Hinojosa said \"50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college.\" According tofederal figures,50 percent of Hispanic undergraduates received the grants for 2011-2012, the latest year for which figures were available.

        "claim": "Says Hillary Clinton's plan \"would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent.\"",
        "doc": "Donald Trump focused on the economy during an Aug. 8 speech in Detroit, saying he would soon be releasing details of a new economic plan. In the meantime, he launched an attack on his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, saying her economic plan was going to pose serious problems for small businesses. \"Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent,\" he said, adding later in his speech, \"Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. In other words we're reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I'm proposing.\" We wondered whether a Clinton presidency meant that small businesses would be paying nearly half their income to the federal government. But first, a word about small businesses. Most of us think of small businesses as businesses with a handful of employees, such as the corner grocery store, the local gasoline station or a nearby restaurant. Yet according to the government's definition, about 97 percent of all United States companies are classified as small by the Small Business Administration. In some sectors, you can have 1,500 employees or gross income of up to $38.5 million and still be considered a small business. (The IRS has its own set of rules.) When we asked the Trump campaign about the \"almost 50 percent\" claim, spokesman Dan Kowalski sent us a breakdown. Currently the top tax rate is 39.6 percent. Add 3.8 percent that a business owner could potentially be paying in Medicare taxes and you get 43.4 percent. That's under the current system. Clinton is proposing a 4 percent surcharge on high earners. That would bring the total tax rate to 47.4 percent, which is where the Trump campaign gets its \"almost 50 percent\" claim. \"This rate would apply to virtually any small business with substantial income, regardless of industry,\" Kowalski said, and he referred us to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. We contacted the center, where senior fellow Roberton Williams said Trump's percentages were correct, but there's more to the story. That 4 percent tax only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million. That could be individuals or small business owners who report their business income on their individual tax returns. In addition, it would not apply to that first $5 million. Only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at an extra 4 percent. The surcharge \"is not targeted to small business. It's a wealthy person's tax,\" Williams told us. \"To the extent that those people are small business people, you can argue it's hitting small businessmen. But the bulk of small businesses are not at those income levels.\" Robert McIntyre, director of the progressive group Citizens for Tax Justice, said only 34,251 of the 150 million tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That's about 0.02 percent. And because, in some industries, you are no longer considered a small business when you have more than 100 employees or more than $750,000 in revenue, it's not known how many of the people in that 0.02 percent would meet the definition of a small business. Finally, in August 2011 the Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that only 0.5 percent of small businesses report a profit in excess of $1 million, another indication that the surcharge would only affect a tiny fraction of small businesses. The surcharge would not affect corporate tax returns. Our ruling Trump said Clinton's plan \"would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent.\" Clinton's proposal isn't directed at small businesses. Her surtax is intended to apply to rich individuals. The top tax rate (plus Medicare taxes) would go from the current 43.4 percent to 47.4 percent, but it would only be applied to amounts over $5 million. A mere 0.02 percent of tax returns fall into that category and some of those payers will not be small business owners. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

        "doc": "\"The one who sets parliament on fire and gives open threats to institutions, Sheikh Rasheed has made the excuse of being sick and is hiding in a hospital,\" reads an Urdu tweet posted on August 11. The tweet, shared by an account with more than 110,000 followers, shows a photo of Ahmed in a hospital bed. Ahmed is a vocal critic of the ruling coalition that took power after ex-prime minister Imran Khan was booted from office in April. Ahmed served as interior minister under Khan and is head of Pakistan's Awami Muslim League (AML) party. The photo was shared online, including on Facebook and Twitter, after Ahmed accused police in the capital Islamabad of raiding his home and AML's offices. Police denied raiding his home, but did not comment on the alleged raid on AML's offices. Ahmed's allegation came hours after a senior member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party Shahbaz Gill was arrested on charges of making seditious remarks on live TV. Police have raided the homes and offices of a string of opposition party members since Khan's ouster. Some social media users appear to believe the photos genuinely show Ahmed hiding in hospital. \"Sheikh Rasheed reached the hospital for treatment out of fear of being arrested,\" one user wrote in Urdu. Another described Ahmed as the \"devil of Pindi\", referring to the ex-minister's constituency, and accused him of \"faking an illness\" in light of \"Shahbaz Gill's situation\". However, the claim is false. A reverse image search found the photo in a report from Pakistan's Dunya News published on YouTube on June 14, 2020. The photo is shown at the 42-second mark, when the anchor says in Urdu: \"Infected with Covid, Sheikh Rasheed has been admitted to a hospital\". The photo can also be seen at the 02:35 mark in a segment about Ahmed's illness by Pakistan's ARY News published on the same day. Below is a screenshot comparing the photo in the posts (left) with the one from Dunya News (right): Ahmed dismissed claims he was hiding in hospital in a press conference on August 12, in which he said the photo circulating online was old. \"My photo from the corona times has gone viral. These people wish I was dead,\" he said. Pakistan's Geo News reported on the press conference in an article showing the photo circulating in a false context. Ahmed has made public appearances since the false claim surfaced. Videos on his Facebook page here and here show him holding a rally outside his Rawalpindi residence on August 13, the eve of Pakistan's independence day.",

While CNN has published real texts between the pair, this exchange circulating online was invented for a satirical piece published by The New Yorker, and is being misrepresented as a genuine communication between Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and Meadows, former White House chief of staff. A CNN spokesperson confirmed the news outlet didn\u2019t \u201cleak\u201d messages detailing this exact exchange, and no such text messages have been publicly released by the U.S. House committee investigating Jan. 6.THE FACTS: As theJan. 6 panelannounced Thursday that it has sent a letterrequesting an interviewwith Thomas, who is known as Ginni, social media users confused a satirical article imagining a text exchange between the two with real messages that were previously published by CNN.While Thomas, aconservative activist, didcommunicate with peoplein President Donald Trump\u2019s orbit ahead of and on the day that hundreds of Trump\u2019s supporters violently stormed the Capitol, the supposed text messages referencing payment for so-called \u201ccoup buses\u201d were taken from a parody piece in Thursday\u2019s edition of The New Yorker.The fake exchangewas published under the magazine\u2019s \u201cDaily Shouts\u201d section, which it describes as \u201cThe New Yorker\u2019s regular dose of humor, satire, and funny observations.\u201dIt was made to look like Thomas asked Meadows, \u201cPlease tell POTUS that the flood of hellfire destined for the wicked will cleanse his presence and restore his righteous power,\u201d to which Meadows replied, \u201cI agree. Sending.\u201dThe invented exchange also included Thomas saying, \u201cAlso Venmo request me for the coup buses BTW,\u201d and Meadows replying, \u201cWhat\u2019s the e-mail?\u201d to which Thomas sent \u201cjusticeclarencethomas@supremecourt.private.\u201dSome social media users copied and pasted just the text of the satirical article, failing to point out where it originated or clarify that it did not show an authentic exchange.\u201cCNN leaked some more texts. Ginni Thomas texted Mark Meadows,\u201d one Twitter user wrote, sharing a snippet of The New Yorker piece on Thursday, adding, \u201cYou cannot tell me Clarence didn\u2019t know what was going on!!\u201dThe post gained more than 10,000 shares and 20,000 likes, including replies and comments that indicated many people took the text exchange as real.\u201cCNN just released an email from Ginni Thomas to Mark Meadows in which she used the term \u2018coup buses,\u2019\u201d another post falsely stated.Some of the posts conflated the satirical texts with real exchanges that news outlets obtained this spring. CNN documented a trove of more than2,300 text messagesthat Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and the inauguration, including some with Thomas. The satirical New Yorker article mentioned this CNN release, adding to the confusion online.Emily Kuhn, senior director of communications at CNN Digital Worldwide, confirmed to The Associated press that the misrepresented satirical messages are being incorrectly attributed to CNN. She said the messages were not part of CNN\u2019s April report about Meadows\u2019 texts.\u201cCNN did not publish the satire texts in The New Yorker piece,\u201d Kuhn wrote in an email. \u201cThe text messages in their story and on social are their satirical writing.\u201dThe AP has also reportedthat Thomas sent text messages for weeks imploring Meadows to act to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to copies of the messagesobtained by The Washington Post and CBS News.Copies of the texts were provided to the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, the AP reported.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo was taken in Ontario by photographer Michelle Graham. It, among other similar images, appears on Graham\u2019s website and was shared on Graham\u2019s Instagram and Facebook accounts on Jan. 17.

        "claim": "Says that under Rick Perry\u2019s plan, \"Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25%.\"",
        "doc": "Fix Austin Schools, a group advocating voter approval of four bond propositions benefiting the Austin school district, slammed Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s \"education plan\" in a leaflet fielded by local voters in early May 2013.Under the word \"cut\" in capital letters, one side of the leaflet says: \"Under Rick Perry, Texas has CUT funding for public schools by 25%,\" a conclusion attributed to PolitiFact.Lynda Rife, a consultant to the group, told us the claim echoed our January 2013 review of Perry\u2019s statement to reporters at the time that Texas public school funding grew at three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012.In raw terms, there was a basis for Perry\u2019s claim. However, after adjusting for inflation and the effect of an annual tax swap put in motion by lawmakers and Perry in 2006, we concluded that Texas schools in 2012 were fielding 25 percent less in state aid than what they reaped in 2002. Perry\u2019s claim drew a rating of False.At the time, we looked at enrollment changes and at both overall school spending, counting dollars from state, federal and local sources, and state education aid alone.EnrollmentEnrollment increased about 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12, from more than 4.1 million to nearly 5 million students, according to a December 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. By email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us 2012-13 enrollment was expected to exceed 5 million, a figure subsequently confirmed, Ratcliffe told us recently by email.Overall spendingOverall school expenditures totaled $27.9 billion in 2002 and $44.2 billion in 2012, according to a chart from the Legislative Budget Board, which tracks fiscal issues for lawmakers.That makes for a difference of 58 percent, though that\u2019s also before adjusting for inflation, which the board\u2019s staff did by converting figures to 2004 dollars using an inflation adjuster devised by the federal government, the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government.In 2004 dollars, Texas public school spending in 2002 totaled $30.1 billion. In 2012, the total was $33.3 billion--11 percent greater than in 2002.By this measure, then, it looks like school enrollment went up faster than spending. Then again, we learned, these figures were not behind Perry\u2019s statement.State spending alonePerry\u2019s then-spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, told us by email that Perry was referring to the difference in state education spending alone \"as those are the funds the state has control over.\"The budget board\u2019s chart shows $10.9 billion in state spending on the schools in 2002 and $18.9 billion in 2012, for a 73 percent difference, or a little more than Perry\u2019s declared 70 percent.Adjusting for inflation, though, reduces the increase to 20 percent, which was still outpacing enrollment growth. In 2004 dollars, such spending was $14.2 billion in 2012, compared with $11.8 billion in 2002.Another crucial factorAnalyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities and school lobbyist Lynn Moak, a former Texas Education Agency official, each pointed out another wrinkle, suggesting that any consideration of state education spending should take into account changes in law approved in 2006 resulting in the state picking up about $7 billion more in annual costs in return for school districts cutting local maintenance and operation property tax rates.Castro said by email: \"The property tax cut was $14.2 billion a biennium, or $7.1 billion every year. That means the state had to put in that amount of money a year to offset local property taxes falling by the same amount.\"The shift in funding sources did not, in itself, step up aid received by the schools, Castro said.Moak said by phone: \"This was simply a source-of-funds transfer.\"To adjust for the annual cost shift, we subtracted $7.1 billion from the state spending in 2012, suggesting a $0.9 billion difference from the 2002 spending. However, adjusting for inflation makes the 2012 state spending equal $8.2 billion in 2002 dollars--25 percent less than the $10.9 billion spent in 2002, which also would mean that spending trailed enrollment growth.For this article, finally, we weighed the message that the reduced spending was Perry\u2019s education plan. Perry was governor through all the spending decisions, but the reality is that Republican majorities of the 150-member House and 31-member Senate were needed to pass the decisions into law. Perry was key, but he didn't dictate actions. No governor can.Our rulingThe pro-bonds\u2019 group said that under Perry\u2019s education plan, Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25 percent.State education spending in 2012 was 25 percent lower than it was in 2002, adjusting for inflation and the real effects of the 2006 law giving the state more responsibility for education revenues.Yet Perry didn\u2019t cause the reduction by himself; lawmakers acted, too. This clarification is missing from the group\u2019s statement, which we rate as Mostly True.",

        "doc": "A YouTube video claiming to be a public service announcement from the 1950s has gone viral. The video warns of a virus that will break out by the year 2020. But did experts really predict a 2020 virus more than 60 years ago? Here\u2019s how we fact-checked it. Look for evidence When you come across suspicious claims, look for any proof that what the person is saying is true. Turning to the YouTube description to see if it provides any further information or sources, we instead found this: \u201cI only threw this together because I wanted to have a video uploaded on February 29th.\u201d The YouTuber also states in the description that the footage came from Archive.org. Try a \u201cLateral Reading\u201d To ensure you get the full story, try practicing a skill the Stanford History Education Group calls \u201clateral reading.\u201d Basically, instead of doing a keyword search and just reading one article up and down, you\u2019re going to open up a bunch of tabs and read laterally across all of them. Doing a keyword search with the words \u201cCOVID-19 pandemic predicted by 1950s PSA\u201d brought up multiple fact checks from reputable organizations, including Snopes, USA Today and Reuters. According to Snopes, the video combines modern-day narration with a mix of archival footage. Some of the footage came from movies like the 1956 film \u201cTornado\u201d and \u201cLeave It To Roll-Oh\u201d from the 1940s. Snopes wrote that this was meant to be satire. The biggest clue that this video was meant to be a joke was probably the fact that right after the narrator says they will provide the answers for avoiding the deadly virus, the video cuts to a screen that says \u201cfootage missing.\u201d USA Today also reported that this was meant to be a satirical video, and that it was made in 2020. According to the article, the creator of the video, Max Patrick Schlienger, recorded the voiceover himself. According to the Reuters fact check, Schlienger told Reuters via email that he was \u201ca little bit disheartened\u201d that his work was being spread as misinformation, and said, \u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s nonetheless entertaining people and hopefully doing some good.\u201d Understanding satire vs. misinformation Satire is false information that\u2019s meant to be a joke, and it usually makes fun of an issue or recent events through irony or exaggeration. But when satire is shared as fact, it becomes misinformation. While the video itself was made for comedic purposes and it clearly states that in the YouTube description, the \u201cPSA\u201d resurfaced on other platforms, particularly Facebook. One Facebook caption says the video \u201cwas made on Feb. 29, 1956, 65 years ago.\u201d Notably missing is the fact that this video \u2026 isn\u2019t real. This is a prime example of why it\u2019s important to find the original source of a claim before resharing. Bonus tip: Be careful when you see claims jump from platform to platform. While the YouTube description makes it clear this was a joke, versions on other platforms conveniently left out that detail. Rating This should come as no surprise, this PSA video is Not Legit. The video was created in the year 2020, not 1956, and the video\u2019s creator has clarified that this was just meant to be funny.",

        "claim": "\"Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin\u2019s streets.\"",
        "doc": "CLARIFICATION, 3:46 p.m., Sept. 9, 2016: Shortly after this fact check posted, we revised a sentence to say that we didn't find research tying the addition of simple bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. We'd originally said we didn't see research generally tying bike lanes to crash reductions. Our rating of the group's claim didn't change. After a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, the group\u2019s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: \"Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin\u2019s streets.\" Does that hold up? Group cites city report To our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, \"Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014,\" analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast. In what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns. A 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays. We dug into Austin\u2019s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don\u2019t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, stripedbike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. The cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes. A city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010. A close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane. SOURCE: Google Earth. Monroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists. It\u2019s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after. The full report presents general crash-reduction analyses for five of the 37 projects. Among the five, it sums up, \"right-sizing projects,\" or road diets, contributed to at least 22 percent fewer crashes, on Amherst Drive, up to the nearly 39 percent reduction on the Manor Road stretch. We calculated the average of the five: 28.8 percent fewer crashes. Expert: Road diets reduce accidents For outside perspective, we reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, hearing back about road diets, bike lanes and sidewalks from Joan Hudson, an associate research engineer. Hudson advised that the noted 38 percent reduction in crashes falls in line with national research she\u2019s reviewed, also pointing us to the highway administration and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program -- a division of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Each agency highlights the same two studies finding \"the road-diet treatment had a significant effect\" in reducing crashes, as the cooperative research program said in a 2008 report. The reductions ranged from 19 to 47 percent, with an average of 29 percent. Hudson said road diets make roads safer for a few reasons: additional space improves reaction time, and a narrower roadway tends to reduce how fast drivers go, making crashes less severe. Road diets also make bicyclists more comfortable, she said, because they have dedicated space instead of sharing lanes with cars. The city\u2019s report also reflected these points. Hudson confirmed that most road diets include bike lanes, but said sidewalks -- posing greater costs than what it takes to revise lane lines -- are hardly ever included. (It looks to us like a sidewalk may have been installed on the Manor Road stretch. To our query, Monroy said shecouldn\u2019t confirm it was part of the related road-diet project.) And by phone, Hudson told us that determining how much road diets reduce crashes involving bicyclists or pedestrians is hard because there\u2019s not much data measuring bicycle and pedestrian traffic before and after roads are relined. It may be, for instance, she said, that bike accidents escalate after a project is completed largely because more bicyclists use the added bike lanes. That looks to us like what happened on the on the Manor Road stretch, where bike traffic more than doubled with bike crashes only slightly going up. Bike lanes alone? We wondered if perhaps bike lanes alone result in double-digit crash reductions. To our inquiry, a University of Wisconsin urban planning professor, Robert Schneider, said by email that \"it is difficult to make a specific statement\" about how a particular bike lane reduces crashes, because that\u2019s not what researches examine. Schneider, who teaches about pedestrian and bike safety, said research tends to be broader, looking at what experts call \"networks\" -- routes through whole cities or significant parts of cities -- to determine how easy and safe it is to get around on a bike. Research examining those networks, Schneider said, shows that bike-friendly cities help drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians stay safe. He cited a 2011 study from two engineers at the University of Colorado-Denver finding that when intersections and roads are easier for cyclists to navigate and more cyclists hit the road, drivers tend to slow down and be more aware of their surroundings. A Bike Austin leader, Miller Nuttle, informed of our findings, said its claim wasn\u2019t worded as precisely as it should have been. Our ruling Bike Austin said: \"Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin\u2019s streets.\" Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced.But Bike Austin didn\u2019t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in anypercentage plummet in crashes.Instead, the city analysisstates that reconfiguring lanes on part of one road, which also gainedbike lanes, preceded 38 percent fewercrashes--with crashreductions averaging 29 percent among five road-diet projects.

        "doc": "In the GOP primary race for Georgia\u2019s governor, former Sen. David Perdue has a message he wants voters to carry with them when they decide whether Gov. Brian Kemp should progress in his bid to retain the state\u2019s top seat: Kemp \"caved\" to Democrats during the 2020 presidential election in an election-stealing move that sealed the fate of President Donald Trump\u2019s loss in Georgia. It\u2019s an assertion built on two falsehoods. The first, that Trump\u2019s election was stolen. And the second, that a settlement reached in a lawsuit related to the state\u2019s absentee ballot system somehow threw the results in Joe Biden\u2019s favor as Kemp looked on approvingly. \"When they passed that consent decree, it invalidated all voter ID law\" and \"allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted into the race,\" Perdue said, addressing Kemp during an April 24 primary debate. \"Absolutely that\u2019s what the consent decree did and you allowed it to happen.\" That\u2019s not what happened. And Perdue\u2019s characterization of what he inaccurately termed a \"consent decree\" gets a lot of facts wrong. Here we explain the lawsuit settlement at the center of Perdue\u2019s accusations \u2014 themes that have also been repeated by Trump, who has characterized the agreement as \"horrible,\" a \"disaster\" and \"more poorly negotiated\" than the Iran nuclear deal. Perdue\u2019s campaign did not respond to our queries. The primary is May 24. The winner will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in November. In 2018, Abrams narrowly lost the governor\u2019s race to Kemp, who was Secretary of State at the time. Simultaneously, a Republican won a congressional race by just 0.14% in Gwinnett County, which rejected more absentee ballots than any other county in Georgia. In November 2019, spurred by those midterm election results, the Democratic Party of Georgia and national Democratic groups filed a federal lawsuit against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and election officials in Gwinnett. The main point of the lawsuit was to challenge election officials\u2019 procedures for notifying voters when their absentee ballots were rejected due to missing or mismatched signatures. Though a state law required election officials to \"promptly\" notify voters of missing or mismatched signatures, it didn\u2019t include specific timeframes. That meant that each county set its own rules for how long it could take to notify voters of their problematic ballots and each had its own plan for how it should attempt to contact the voters about the issue. The Democrats\u2019 suit also challenged the design of the ballot envelope in Gwinnett County. As it was, instructions were printed in a small font size on the envelope. The lawsuit argued that the small type resulted in many Gwinnett voters not realizing their signatures were required. In March 2020, Raffensperger and the Democrats reached what was called a \"compromise settlement agreement and release\" \u2014 not a consent decree \u2014 in the lawsuit. A settlement agreement is a resolution signed by the parties without a court order, while a consent decree is entered as a court order enforceable by a judge. The State Election Board agreed to new notification rules for rejected absentee ballots. Officials agreed to notify voters by mail, and if available, by telephone and email, within three business days of receiving the ballot and to give them an opportunity to fix it. State officials also agreed to issue an official bulletin to local election officials about signature matching procedures. The bulletin indicated that if an election official finds a signature mismatch, the official has to seek review from two other election officials. Gwinnett officials agreed to a more clear ballot design. The settlement doesn\u2019t appear to have had any significant impact on absentee ballot rejections in the November 2020 election. The signature match ballot rejection rate increased slightly from 0.18% in 2018 to 0.2% in 2020, according to the Secretary of State. We found no evidence that the settlement opened up the door to fraudulent ballots. \u200b\u200bThe presidential election results in Georgia were counted three times, and each showed Biden won. Republican statewide election officials said that they found no evidence of systematic voter fraud. Perdue said during the debate that the agreement \"invalidated all voter ID law\" but the settlement made zero mention of voter identification law. It would be possible for voters to hear Perdue\u2019s statement and assume Georgia has no voter ID law, but that would be wrong. Georgia law requires photo identification when voting in person or absentee. In 2021, a new state law took effect adding ID rules for absentee voting. During the debate, while speaking about the agreement, Perdue said that Kemp \"allowed it to happen\" and suggested he should have called a special legislative session. Kemp countered \"I had nothing to do with\" it and that under state law \"the reason I affirmed the certification of the election is because the law says \u2018I shall.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t say \u2018I may.\u2019\" Kemp\u2019s campaign spokesperson Tate Mitchell told us that Kemp played no role in the settlement between Raffensperger and the Democratic Party of Georgia. Kemp was not a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the settlement agreement makes no mention of Kemp\u2019s name. Perdue said that a consent decree approved by Kemp \"invalidated all voter ID law\" and \"allowed fraudulent ballots to be accepted into the race.\" Perdue\u2019s statements are rife with inaccuracies. There was no consent decree, which would have been overseen by a judge. Instead, there was a settlement agreement involving state and Gwinnett County election officials and state and national Democratic groups. Kemp had no role in the matter. The agreement spelled out that when an absentee ballot is rejected for a missing or mismatched signature, election officials have three days to contact the voter by mail, and if possible, by telephone and email. It also said that in the event of a signature mismatch, an election official has to seek the review of two other officials. The agreement said nothing about voter ID law and we found no evidence that it opened the door to the counting of fraudulent ballots. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

Rick Scott has drawn criticism from environmentalists for denying in 2011 that man contributes to climate change and now dodging questions with the reply of \"I\u2019m not a scientist.\" The topic arose during the Oct. 21 CNN debate when moderator Jake Tapper asked Gov. Rick Scott why he was \"reluctant to believe the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that man contributes to climate change.\" Instead of answering the question directly, Scott claimed that he had already taken action to protect the environment, including addressing sea-level rise. \"We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise down in the Keys, or down in the Miami area. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs,\" he said. Scott made a similar claim in the debate at Broward College on Oct. 15. Scott\u2019s claim, particularly about investing in projects to combat sea-level rise, stood out for us. Under Scott, has the state spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise in the Miami area and hundreds of millions to protect coral reefs? Did Scott invest hundreds of millions to help coral reefs? We asked a Scott campaign spokeswoman to provide details about the spending for both projects. As for the coral reefs, Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact that the state had \"$100 million spent on protecting the Keys.\" The money stemmed from a mandate by the state for the Keys to upgrade from cesspits and septic tanks to a modern sewer system. Improving water quality can help coral reefs. In 1999 when Jeb Bush was governor, the state required that the Keys comply with wastewater standards that would necessitate modern sewer by 2010. That deadline would later be extended to 2015. To meet that goal, when Charlie Crist, was governor the Legislature approved a bill in 2008 that allowed bonding of $50 million a year for four years for the wastewater program. The bill stated that \"beginning July 1, 2010, the Legislature shall analyze the ratio of the state's debt to projected revenues prior to the authorization to issue any bonds under this section.\" No money was actually doled out during the Crist administration, which coincided with the recession. Scott took over as governor in 2011. The first year that the state doled out money was in 2012. But the next year Scott, along with legislative leaders, decided not to issue bonds due to concerns about the state\u2019s debt capacity, according to an article in the Florida Keys Keynoter. In 2014, the state doled out the second $50 million. In August 2014, Scott\u2019s campaign released a \"Let\u2019s Keep Florida Beautiful Plan,\" which included a promise to invest another $100 million in the Keys wastewater project. So how does the sewer system relate to coral reefs? Centralized wastewater treatment prevents nutrients and other pollutants from entering nearshore waters, said Chris Bergh of The Nature Conservancy in the Keys. Wastewater treatment kills bacteria from human waste that can cause coral disease. \"It was a great boon to the Keys environment and residents, but it will not affect sea-level rise in any but the most tangential ways,\" Bergh said. Sea-level rise money A spokesman for Scott\u2019s office, John Tupps, sent us a list of what he said amounted to over $350 million \"to address flood mitigation and sea-level rise.\" The projects were administered by various state agencies and included the following, in addition to the $100 million for sewer in the Keys: \u2022$21 million for FEMA flood map modernization; \u2022$122 beach protection projects; \u2022$5 million for the coastal zone management program; \u2022$80 million for flood mitigation in Florida in coastal communities; \u2022$25 million for the Keys wastewater revolving loan program projects. The first thing we will point out is to get to $350 million Scott counted $100 million to install a sewer system in the Keys even though the point of that project wasn\u2019t to deal with sea-level rise. We asked environmental experts if these additional projects should be considered as steps toward combating sea-level rise. They told us that while these projects have their merits, they aren\u2019t long-term solutions to sea-level rise. For example, better flood maps help identify properties that are vulnerable under today\u2019s conditions to flooding, but they don\u2019t deal with future sea-level rise, Bergh said. These are typical beach maintenance and flooding-related projects. Scott hasn\u2019t taken steps that scientists say would address future sea-level rise such as reducing coal-fired power plants. Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton said that if the beach protection projects refer to pumping sand onto the beach, that is an \"ineffective short-term temporary fix.\" Chanton was one of the scientists who met with Scott this summer and urged him to take action on climate change. The scientists showed Scott how two feet of sea-level rise -- projected by 2048 -- will swallow much of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. They called on Scott to reduce or eliminate coal-fired power plants; wean the state off carbon-emitting natural gas and oil-fired power; and develop more alternative energy options. The scientists noted that sea-level rise has already caused flooding in Miami Beach at high tide. We also sought out several government officials in Broward and Miami-Dade counties as well as the cities of Miami and Miami Beach to see if they had received state money to combat sea-level rise. No one could pinpoint a specific project. \"I have no idea what he's talking about. It's the first I've heard of it,\" said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers, who serves on the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, in an interview with the Florida Keys Keynoter. Our ruling Scott said during the CNN debate, \"We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise\" in the Miami area and \"hundreds of millions dollars to deal with coral reefs.\" The state has spent $100 million to help the Keys upgrade to a sewer system, which should improve water quality -- a benefit for coral reefs. Scott omits that it was under Crist that the Legislature passed a law paving the way for the money, and he's wrong to claim it's \"hundreds of millions.\" Scott\u2019s office also pointed to a list of projects including flood mitigation, flood maps and beach protection -- and throws in the $100 million for the sewer project -- to make his claim about $350 million to deal with sea-level rise. While these include worthy projects, experts say they aren't directly relatedto addressing future sea-level rise. They\u2019re typical projects for Florida, not new measures to address climate change. We rate this claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Nigeria spends close to 3% to 3.5% of GDP on healthcare, while South Africa spends 8.25% and Kenya spends 5.2%.",
        "doc": "In an August 2021 broadcast of the Nigerian TV show Journalists' Hangout, a public policy expert and journalists discussed problems in the country's healthcare system. Three claims made on the show \u2013 about the number of doctors emigrating to the UK, doctor numbers in the country and Nigeria's high birth rate \u2013 are correct. A claim about its limited residency programme is mostly correct. But a claim that the World Health Organization has a standard for the doctor to population ratio is misleading. The number of registered and practising doctors is unproven, as is the number who migrate each year. Spending on healthcare in comparison to Kenya and South Africa is understated. If a doctors' strike during Nigeria's third Covid-19 wave and a deadly cholera outbreak wasn't hard enough, health professionals were \"rushing\" to leave the country, a TV discussion found. \"Migration is a milder term to describe their exit, they are now escaping abroad,\" said Olatokunbo Otitoju , a doctor and public policy analyst. He was speaking in August 2021 on Journalists' Hangout , a show where journalists analyse current issues. We took a close look at some key claims made on the day's episode, titled \"Nigerian doctors rush abroad to escape harsh situations\". Africa Check contacted Otitoju, who made most of the claims we check in this report, for the source of his data. He sent us links to pages on the World Health Organization 's website and a March 2020 newspaper report on Nigeria's doctor population . Show host Ayodele Ozugbakun got the ball rolling by claiming that 4,528 Nigerian doctors had left for the UK in the past six years. \"I can confirm that figure is correct and current,\" Jack Bellamy, a spokesperson for the UK General Medical Council , told Africa Check. The council keeps a register of doctors licensed to practise in the country. Since 2015, some 4,528 doctors whose primary medical qualification was in Nigeria had joined the UK register , Bellamy said. The figure excludes Nigerians trained in the UK. Resident doctors are medical school graduates training to become specialists. In the US, their training period came to be called a \"residency\" because they mostly lived in the hospital. In Nigeria, 163 public and private hospitals are approved for the residency programme. These have 13,118 slots available for both junior and senior residents. Getting a limited residency placement involves a highly competitive written examination. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi is the president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors . He told Africa Check that bottlenecks in the system meant some doctors do not get slots. \"We have a strength number of 17,000 and many of them are leaving in droves to Saudi Arabia, UK and the US,\" he said. Those who left were not replaced. One reason for this was a requirement that hospitals seek approval before employing a resident doctor, Okhuaihesuyi said. Some 2,285 students graduated in medicine in 2019, official data shows. A 2018 survey of Nigerian doctors also identified difficulties in getting residencies as a key obstacle. \"Most doctors interviewed indicated that securing a residency position was even more difficult than securing an internship position which is already considered quite challenging,\" the survey says . The government has been urged to fully implement the residency training act to overcome the residency problem. In tracking progress on health for the United Nations' sustainable development goals, the WHO classifies countries with fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people as having insufficient health professionals. The classification also applies to countries with fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery staff per 10,000 people. According to the WHO's global health workforce data , Nigeria had 3.8 doctors per 10,000 people in 2018. (Note: The most recent local data from Nigeria is from 2017 . It shows an even lower count of two doctors for every 10,000 people.) The WHO previously told Africa Check that it does not have an ideal population to health workers ratio . Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the organisation, said any ratio should be determined based on countries' individual needs, including population demographics and the burden of disease. \"However, there are some global benchmarks used for monitoring global healthworker needs,\" he said. The sustainable development goals composite index threshold recommends that 4.45 health workers \u2013 doctors, nurses and midwives \u2013 should cater to 1,000 people to reach the minimum high coverage proportion of 80% for 12 selected health indicators . \"There have also been other global thresholds. These should be treated as indicative benchmarks for global monitoring, not for planning at the country level,\" Jasarevic said. The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) regulates the professions. Data on the number of doctors practising in Nigeria differs widely. The MDCN has not published data on those it has registered. In February 2019, in response to a freedom of information request by a national newspaper , it released data showing 39,912 were listed with it in December 2017. It added that 91,079 medical and dental practitioners have been registered with the council from its inception in 1963 to December 2017. Licences granted by the council have to be renewed annually. The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), in turn, says it has over 40,000 members in Nigeria and about 19,000 abroad. The professional body has had this number since 2017, it told Africa Check , because getting an exact number \"has been a challenge because of the flow of doctors out of the country\". In March 2020, a health ministry official said the number of registered medical doctors in Nigeria was at 74,543 as of December 2018. But in August 2021 we could not find any recent data about how many doctors were practising in the country. In May 2019 former NMA president Francis Faduyile also made this claim , but did not provide supporting data. According to an online register maintained by the UK General Medical Council , 8,590 Nigerian doctors were licensed to practise in the country in August 2021. In 2006, the first year of the data, there were 2,692 doctors. This makes for an annual average of 393 doctors over 15 years. The US Federation of State Medical Boards supports state medical boards in licensing, disciplining and regulating healthcare professionals. It has told Africa Check that 3,895 Nigeria-educated doctors were licensed to practise medicine in the US as of 2020. We have asked the federation for historical data. The US, UK and Canada have been identified as top destinations for Nigerian doctors , with South Africa a popular destination for those who choose to remain in Africa. We have not found any verifiable data to support the claim that about 2,000 doctors leave Nigeria every year. Otitoju said Nigeria needs doctors to cater to its large population and high birth rate, which he said was one of the highest in the world. The nationally representative 2018 Demographic Health Survey put the country's crude birth rate at 38 births per 1,000 population. This was higher in rural areas, at 42 births per 1,000 people, than in urban areas, which had an average of 34 births per 1,000 residents. The World Bank estimated Nigeria had 37.4 births per 1,000 people in 2019, against a global average of 18 births per 1,000 people. Niger, Chad, Somalia, Congo, Mali and Angola had the highest birth rates, with more than 40 births per 1,000 people. Nigeria's birth rate is high because contraceptive use is low, Audu Idrisa, a professor and consultant obstetrician at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno, told Africa Check. He said educating all people, including in schools, was important. \"Women should get pregnant only when they are ready.\" According to World Bank data , Nigeria spent 3.89% \u2013 not 3.5% \u2013 of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare in 2018. This is the bank's most recent available data. In comparison, Kenya's healthcare spending was 5.17% of GDP, and South Africa's 8.25%. The World Bank's figures come from its global health expenditure database . Why does it matter? The WHO says current health expenditure as a share of GDP is an important measure. \"It shows the importance of the health sector in the whole economy and indicates the societal priority which health is given, measured in monetary terms.\" In 2001, African Union members agreed to commit at least 15% of their annual budgets to health. The declaration was signed in Abuja, Nigeria's capital city. By 2011, only Tanzania had reached the target . Botswana, Rwanda, Madagascar, Togo and Zambia achieved it in 2013 and Swaziland got there in 2015 . Nigeria's health sector 'underfunded' \"There is no country that can develop if the citizens are not healthy so we have to see health as a priority but that is not the case with Nigeria,\" Tanimola Akande, a professor of public health at the University of Ilorin in western Nigeria, told Africa Check. \"The country where the Abuja Declaration was signed has not achieved the 15% budgetary allocation target since the agreement was signed. The funding available for health in Nigeria is horrible.\" Akande added: \"We also have the national health act which says 1% of the consolidated revenue fund will be used to fund healthcare. We have started doing that but it has not gone a long way.\". The consolidated fund is the federal government's account .",

        "doc": "When candidates debate in Nevada, you can bet Yucca Mountain will be mentioned. And Hillary Clinton had her facts in order during a Jan. 15, 2008, debate in Las Vegas. Yucca Mountain is the proposed site for a controversial proposal to store much of the nation's nuclear waste in one place. Predictably, most Nevadans oppose this. The original opening date for the site was in 1998, but opposition has prevented the project from going forward and its fate is unclear. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is a powerful opponent. Both Clinton and Obama have urged that the project be shelved. A prominent supporter of Yucca Mountain, though, is Exelon Corp., an electric utility based in Chicago. Exelon operates the largest nuclear fleet (17 reactors) in the United States and the third-largest commercial nuclear fleet in the world, according to Exelon's Web site. In a speech to nuclear energy executives in May 2007, Exelon CEO John Rowe said permanent disposal at Yucca Mountain or a similar facility remains \"a long-term imperative\" for the industry, even while he acknowledged it would not happen soon. We asked a spokesman for Exelon if they've spent \"millions\" promoting Yucca Mountain. We were told they don't track their spending by project. Public records, though, indicate the company has spent more than $10-million on lobbyists between 2002 and 2007, with Yucca Mountain listed among its top issues. That doesn't count previous years; the Yucca Mountain project has been debated for more than 20 years. Meanwhile, campaign finance records confirm Exelon is one of Obama's top contributors. The Center for Responsive Politics found that Exelon employees were his sixth-largest corporate donor group. (No. 1 was Goldman Sachs.) The Obama campaign points to several mitigating factors: Obama opposes Yucca Mountain. Exelon is one of the largest companies and employers in Obama's hometown of Chicago. Obama has sponsored legislation specifically targeting Exelon after unplanned waste releases in Illinois. Obama has not accepted any money from Exelon lobbyists or Exelon's political action committee; rather, the contributions are from people who work at Exelon. Of all these points, it's the last we find most compelling. Obama is not taking money from Exelon as a corporate entity or PAC, rather he's accepting contributions from Exelon executives and employees. (Clinton, by contrast, accepts federal PAC money, though she hasn't accepted any from Exelon.) It's a small but real difference, so we rate her claim on Obama's ties to Exelon to be Mostly True. ",

        "doc": "Florida lawmakers are poised to pass voting law changes after being mocked for long lines and delayed results during the 2012 presidential election. But in the waning days of the legislative session, Senate Democrats are criticizing the plan as not going far enough to address the problems at the polls last year. \"This bill mandates only two things that will address concerns from the last election,\" wrote Sen. Chris Smith, the Senate Democratic leader from Fort Lauderdale, in a column in the Sun-Sentinel April 21. \"It allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary. Under SB 600, Broward, Dade, Palm Beach, Duval, Orange, Hillsborough, Jackson, Franklin, Dixie and all the rest of our 67 counties can do exactly what they did in 2012, with the exception of just two more hours per day for early voting. Nothing else is mandated. Nothing else is changed.\" The column left readers with the impression that the bill changed little for the better. Smith called it \"an opportunity lost.\" Democrats and Republicans are split on some provisions of the bill, so there are varying perspectives as to what \"concerns\" came up after the last election. We wanted to fact-check Smith\u2019s claim that the election bill \"allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary.\" Inside the elections bills First, some quick history. In 2011, the GOP-dominated Legislature passed an elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. Gov. Rick Scott signed the 2011 elections bill but distanced himself from it after Florida\u2019s 2012 election drew national ridicule. Scott announced his own recommendations for reform that echoed proposals from the state elections supervisors association. On April 16, the Florida Senate reworked the House elections bill, HB 7013. The Senate is scheduled to take a final vote on its version of the bill on April 24, after which it will go back to the House. We read the bill and interviewed elections officials, lawmakers involved in crafting the bill and Senate staff to analyze what the bill will and won\u2019t do. Let\u2019s look at the two changes Smith mentioned. Absentee ballot signatures: The bill gives voters a second chance if they forgot to sign their absentee ballot. The bill says they would have until 5 p.m. the Sunday before Election Day to correct it. Adds early voting hours: Currently, the law for early voting requires eight days and between six to 12 hours a day for a combined 48 to 96 hours. The proposed law would create between 64 hours (eight days, 8 hours each) and 168 hours (14 days, 12 hours each) at the discretion of elections supervisors. Smith said the law would mandate an extra two hours a day of early voting. That\u2019s true -- counties that had six hours would now have to increase it to at least eight. Still, Smith wants elections supervisors to offer 168 hours, even though many said that would be too demanding and unnecessary, especially in smaller counties and primary elections. Smith wants voters in all counties to have the same access to the polls. \"I dont give a damn. This is voting. This is a fundamental right,\" Smith told PolitiFact Florida. \"This is what people have died in the streets for, this is what people are dying overseas for. Just because an elected official doesn't want to do their job, maybe they shouldn't be supervisor of elections.\" The elections supervisors\u2019 association wrote a letter endorsing SB 600 as \"an excellent election reform bill.\" The association had two top priorities of equal weight: reducing the ballot length and expanding options for early voting sites and hours. Smith\u2019s claim that the bill only mandates an extra two hours a day of early voting is factually correct, but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, said Brian Corley, Pasco County\u2019s elections supervisor and leader of the association\u2019s legislative affairs this year. (Corley is a Republican; his association includes supervisors from both parties.) The association was not seeking a one-size-fits-all mandate to expand hours because large counties may need more hours than smaller counties, he said. \"Do you think (Palm Beach supervisor Susan) Bucher or (Broward supervisor Brenda) Snipes in Broward for a major presidential or gubernatorial election is really going to have 64 hours?\" he said. \"The answer is obviously no.\" Let\u2019s look at some of the other provisions that would change in election law: Early voting sites: The bill says supervisors \"may\" offer early voting at fairgrounds, civic centers, courthouses, community centers and stadiums. The supervisors don\u2019t have to offer early voting at these places, so it\u2019s not a mandate. Current law allows for early voting only at libraries, city halls and elections offices. Election preparation report: Every supervisor must submit a report three months before Election Day about staffing and equipment. Declaring elections supervisors noncompliant: The Senate added a controversial amendment that allows the state to place elections supervisors in \"noncompliant status\" if they miss deadlines or violate election rules. Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, sponsored that amendment, which appears to be aimed at counties deemed \"underperforming\" in the 2012 election by the state including Miami-Dade and Broward. Supervisors declared noncompliant would lose their \"special qualification salary\" -- the extra $2,000 supervisors can earn if they meet certain criteria. Most of a supervisor\u2019s salary is based on a population formula. About half of the supervisors are currently eligible to receive the $2,000. Voter assistance/ballot brokering: One of the more contentious additions to the bill limits the number of voters a volunteer can assist in an election to 10 people. Further, the voter must know the person assisting him or her before casting a ballot. The bill also limits the number of absentee ballots that paid campaign workers and other solicitors can accept for nonfamily members to two. Voter rights groups attacked the changes as disenfranchising the elderly, disabled voters and non-English speakers. The proposal follows an election in which paid ballot brokers in Miami-Dade, known as boleteros, were arrested. Length of ballot items: Republicans included a 75-word limit on ballot summaries of proposed constitutional amendments that come from the Legislature. Supervisors are pleased this language is in the proposed overhaul. Democrats are displeased because the 75-word limit disappears if the Florida Supreme Court rejects the wording of the ballot summary. Democrats wanted an amendment that limited the summaries to 75 words on all attempts, but Republicans said no. Corley is not worried. He said, \"Could there be a scenario where the Attorney General goes above 75 words in a rewrite? Sure it could, logistically. But I don\u2019t see 650 words.\" Sunday voting: Smith\u2019s column doesn\u2019t mention that the bill would allow voting on the Sunday before Election Day, known as \"Souls to the Polls\" drives in some black communities. Current law bans early voting on that Sunday. Before the 2011 law, supervisors could offer an aggregate of eight hours for early voting on the Saturday and Sunday before the election. Just 10 of 67 counties offered voting on Sunday in the 2010 general election for no more than four hours, including Pinellas and Miami-Dade. The new proposal allows -- but doesn\u2019t mandate -- eight to 12 hours of early voting on this Sunday. The law contains other mandates for supervisors, including requiring them to notify electors the reason their absentee ballot was rejected and to upload early voting and absentee ballots the day before Election Day (but not publicly post it). Smith told PolitiFact Florida in an interview that his comment referred to \"things that affect voters and their time in line.\" He called the measures that affect supervisors and canvassing boards \"inside baseball.\" Our ruling Smith wrote that the election bill \"allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary.\" The bill does mandate those two changes. But Smith omits that some of those discretionary changes in the bill are a big deal and are expected to change how elections are operated in large counties. Elections supervisors in at least some counties are likely to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day and they are likely to add more early voting sites and go beyond the mandated minimum hours. Plus, we found a few provisions that are not discretionary and would affect voters. We rate Smith\u2019s claim Half True.",

In the following year another 1,012,664 work opportunities were created.This amounted to a total of 4,066,691 work opportunities created over five years. This was, however, below the target of 4.5-million work opportunities set by the Expanded Public Works Programme for the period.However, a \u201cwork opportunity\u201d is not a permanent job. A work opportunity is defined as \u201cpaid work created for an individual\u201d as part of South Africa\u2019s expanded public works programme.Many \u201cwork opportunities\u201d last only a few months . For instance, a \u201cwork opportunity\u201d in the \u201cinfrastructure sector\u201d lasts an average of four months and six months in the \u201cenvironment and culture\u201d sector. Ideally, these opportunities are meant to equip people with skills that can help them seek further employment.It should be noted that even though 4-million \u201cwork opportunities\u201d were created it did not mean that 4-million people gained work. If someone was hired for one project and then moved on to another and another, each period of employment would have counted as a single \u201cwork opportunity\u201d.Claim \"On average, the economy has grown at 3.2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.\u201d Verdict mostly-correctUnemployment rate higher after recessionThe claim is largely correct, but lacks context. According to the World Bank \u201cGDP growth in South Africa has averaged 3.2% a year since 1995 \u201d. This was confirmed by Africa\u2019s Check\u2019s own calculations based on real GDP tables.But while Zuma\u2019s numbers were correct, the context was noticeably lacking. Economic growth \u2013 evaluated in terms of real GDP \u2013 has slowed in recent years. In 2012, South Africa\u2019s GDP growth fell to 2.5%. Figures released after this speech showed that it was 1.9% in 2013 and is estimated to be 1.4% in 2014 Rian le Roux, chief economist at Old Mutual, said that to \u201covercome the backlog of 20 years of isolation [South Africa] needs to have fast economic growth\u201d. Insufficient growth will not eliminate the backlog of unemployment or drive the creation of new jobs, and means that even where jobs are created they may not be sustainable.This view was supported by a statement from the International Monetary Fund in October 2013 which praised South Africa\u2019s strong macroeconomic policies but pointed out that the country\u2019s economic performance had been slower and lower than other emerging markets \u2013 and that the growth rate \u201ccreates jobs, but not enough for the growing labo[u]r force and those currently without work\u201d.Claim \u201cJobs are now being created again. There are now [in February 2014] 15-million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650,000 jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.\u201d Verdict misleadingAdditional readingAccording to labour data published by Stats SA early last year, 15,177,000 people were employed in the last quarter of 2013 and 653,000 jobs were created that year.But Zuma\u2019s statement was misleading because he focused on the absolute employment numbers and not ratios. He failed to acknowledge that the unemployment rate in South Africa was higher than it was before the global recession.Prior to the recession South Africa\u2019s unemployment rate was 21.9%. According to Stats SA, in the last quarter of 2013, 4,830,000 South Africans were classified as unemployed, resulting in an unemployment rate of 24.1%. But Stats SA uses a very narrow definition of \u201cunemployment\u201d which refers only people who are unemployed but actively seeking work.An \u201cexpanded rate\u201d of unemployment \u2013 which includes people who do not have a job and are available to work but have not taken active steps to look for work \u2013 suggests that unemployment levels were as high as 34% in the fourth quarter of that year The latest available data from the last three months of 2014, released by Stats SA this week, puts narrow unemployment at 24.3% and expanded unemployment at 34.6%.",

        "claim": "\"Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree.\"",
        "doc": "Former gubernatorial hopeful Tom Luce, the Dallas lawyer long associated with Ross Perot and the landmark 1984 overhaul of state education laws, recently declared that few Texas students succeed in formal schooling past high school, we learned from a reporter\u2019s tweet. Luce, the lead witness at a mid-November 2017 hearing held by the Texas House Select Committee on Economic Competitiveness, said: \"Here are the facts: Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree. Now stop and think about that: Just 20 percent of our youngsters achieve one of those three credentials.\" Luce went on to say the state should be at 80 percent instead. That 20 percent figure was familiar. In March 2016, the state\u2019s commissioner of higher education, Raymund Paredes, told lawmakers that just 20 percent of Texas eighth-graders earn a college degree or other advanced certificate within 11 years (or six years after high school). That conclusion tied to a research approach initially laid out in a February 2012 report commissioned by the Houston Endowment stating that researchers conducted a \"cohort analysis of every student who started 8th grade in a Texas public school in 1996, 1997, and 1998,\" subsequently tracking progress over 11 years. By phone, Luce told us he got his figure from that same longitudinal research posted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Luce also provided a document headlined: \"Given current trajectory, Texas at risk for decreasing educational attainment.\" The document states that 20.9 percent of the state\u2019s eighth-graders in 2005 later earned a certificate or degree from a Texas college or university within six years after high school graduation--with achievement rates varying by ethnicity and economic status. A Coordinating Board staff spokeswoman, Kelly Carper Polden, responded to our emailed inquiry about educational attainment after high school by pointing out a page in the agency\u2019s April 2017 Texas Public Higher Education Almanac indicating that by 2016, of every 100 students enrolled in eighth grade in fall 2005, 74 had graduated from a public high school, 54 had enrolled in higher education in the state and 21 had received a Texas higher education degree or certificate within six years of leaving high school. Of the 21, the almanac says, one student received a certificate, four received an associate degree and 15 received a bachelor\u2019s degree or more. On point to Luce\u2019s focus on high school graduates, Polden also told us that 27 percent of eighth-graders in fall 2005 who went on to graduate from high school had completed a Texas college degree or certificate by 2016. Graduates going to college out of state We recognized, though, that the provided percentages don\u2019t take into account post high-school achievements outside Texas. Polden said the almanac figures do not fold in such students \"because we don\u2019t consistently have that data.\" We wondered how to account for students ultimately earning certificates or college degrees out of state. According to a February 2017 board document, about 5 percent of Texas high-school graduates in recent years enrolled the subsequent fall at an out-of-state college. By phone when we asked, David Gardner, the board\u2019s deputy commissioner for academic planning and policy, estimated that at least 30 percent of all high school graduates who were in eighth grade in fall 2005 have since earned a post-high-school degree or certificate. Gardner said too that many students have accumulated college credit but not yet landed a degree. John Wyatt at the agency emailed us a pie chart indicating another 3 percent of high school graduates had completed a degree or certificate out of state by 2016. That chart indicates that 70 percent of those graduates hadn\u2019t attained a post-high-school degree or certificate by 2016. SOURCE: Email, John Wyatt, director of external relations, THECB, Dec. 1, 2017 Another agency\u2019s analysis We also queried the Texas Education Agency, which oversees public schools. By email, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us how to generate an agency report gauging students who went on to get degrees from Texas institutions. Upshot: Some 24 percent of the state\u2019s 2008-09 high-school graduates earned a Texas community college or four-year college degree by 2015-16: SOURCE: Report, \"2015-16 Texas Public Schools State Summary,\" Texas Education Agency (fetched from website, \"Education Summary - Statewide,\" Texas Public Education Information Resource, TEA and THECB, Nov. 29, 2017) We circled back to Luce, who said by phone that if 27 percent of high school graduates got a Texas college degree or certificate within six years of graduation, that\u2019s \"still a problem.\" Our ruling Luce said: \"Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree.\" This claim has an element of a truth in that a minority of Texas high school graduates shortly earn college degrees or other certificates. But Luce's 20 percent figure is incomplete and inaccurate. Notably, it's limited to students landing degrees in Texas only, leaving out students who attended college out of state. In contrast, we found that some30 percent of high school graduateslanded a college degree or other post-high-school certificate within six years of graduation \u2014 which leaves Luce's percentageoff by 50 percent. The number closest to what Luce cited applies to eighth-graders enrolled in fall 2005; 21 percent of them ultimately earned a college degree or other educational certificate from a Texas institution. We rate Luce\u2019s statement at the hearing Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

        "doc": "Gov. John Kasich\u2019s proposed tax overhaul would affect the pocketbooks of all Ohioans \u2013 whether for good or for ill is a source of disagreement among state lawmakers.The Republican governor\u2019s plan aims to reduce income taxes for all Ohioans by 20 percent, shave down sales tax to 5 percent while broadening the sales-tax base to include previously tax-exempt services, and slash in half taxes on most small-business income. Kasich also wants to reform oil and gas severance taxes.The tax plan is drummed up by Kasich\u2019s administration as a victory for all Ohio taxpayers. But Rep. Dan Ramos, a Lorain Democrat, is among those who liken the budget proposal to a shell game only Ohio\u2019s upper crust can win.\"Under [Kasich\u2019s] plan, the top one percent in Ohio will pay $10,000 less in income tax each year, but Ohio\u2019s working and middle class families will pay more,\" Ramos said Feb. 19 in a written statement.PolitiFact Ohio decided to audit the representative\u2019s numbers.Ramos\u2019 office said the assertion draws from a study released by left-leaning think tank Policy Matters Ohio, which cites calculations by the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.The numbers released in February by ITEP show that the top one percent of Ohio taxpayers, with a mean income above $335,000, would save an average of $10,369 each year. Ohioans earning less than $18,000 would, on average, pay an additional $63 in taxes.ITEP further asserts that Kasich\u2019s proposed tax reform would typically result in a net loss for Ohioans making up to $51,000 each year.But how did ITEP get its numbers?The non-profit said it uses an elaborate microsimulation tax model that calculates the impact of changes to current tax law at the federal and state level. Among the stratified data used in the model are a large sample of federal tax returns, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Census Bureau American Community Surveys, they said.The New York Times has lauded the credibility of the model and Bloomberg has used the model\u2019s calculations as reporting tools.For Ohio, ITEP factored Kasich\u2019s proposed tax revamps \u2013 minus his severance tax plan \u2013 into its calculations and delivered its findings to Policy Matters Ohio.That\u2019s where Ramos picked up the figures and used them in his argument that Kasich\u2019s plan would \"shift the burden of taxes from the shoulders of those who have to the shoulders of those who have not.\" And Ramos is mostly correct.The numbers are credible, but Ramos\u2019s statement implies that every working and middle-class family would pay more under the reform.According to the ITEP numbers, 20 percent of Ohioans earn between $51,000 and $78,000 per year, and would begin to see an average yearly savings of about $75. The line between middle- and upper-class incomes is up for debate \u2013 not one to be defined absolutely by PolitiFact Ohio \u2013 but it\u2019s safe to say that a yearly income of $51,000 is a far cry from upper-class. Ramos was correct in describing the tax benefit to Ohioans with the highest incomes, but he wrongly implied that all working and middle-class families would take a hit under Kasich\u2019s plan. For that, we rate his statement Half True.",

        "doc": "The word \"experimental\" can trigger fear of the unknown and may suggest unforeseeable consequences or complications. Lawmakers aiming to restrict access to gender-affirming care have embraced the term, arguing that their proposals will protect children from such \"experimental\" treatments. A Jan. 1 Instagram post echoed that alarm. \"All \u2018gender affirming care\u2019 for children is 100% experimental,\" read the Instagram post featuring a screenshot of a tweet. \"There are zero long term studies on the effects the drugs and surgeries will have on them.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) (Screenshot from Instagram.) Gender-affirming care is an individualized approach to health care that centers, encourages and supports a person\u2019s gender identity, experts said. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health\u2019s standards of care noted that gender-affirming care is more than just transition-related medical treatments such as hormone therapy or surgical procedures. Gender-affirming care for children might include allowing a child to wear whatever clothes they like or encouraging the use of the name and pronouns that align with the child\u2019s gender identity, said Dr. Michelle Forcier, a pediatrics professor who specializes in gender and sexual and reproductive health at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Those types of emotional and social affirmation \u2014 which also include creating a safe space to explore gender identity \u2014 are important elements of pediatric gender-affirming care, said Dr. Jason Rafferty, a pediatrician and child psychiatrist at Hasbro Children\u2019s Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. Forcier and Rafferty emphasized that gender-affirming care for children is based on individual needs and goals. Social support is the only type of gender-affirming care recommended for children before puberty, said Shane Diamond, a World Professional Association for Transgender Health spokesperson. As children reach adolescence, medical treatments might become part of their care. Dr. Renata Arrington-Sanders, an adolescent and young adult medicine associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said there is \"an extensive body of evidence-based, peer reviewed research on gender-affirming care\" that informs current standards set by organizations, including the Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Puberty-blocking medication might be an element of gender-affirming care for children who reach puberty and experience gender dysphoria \u2014 a feeling of distress when their bodies don\u2019t align with their gender identity. Puberty blockers \"help delay unwanted physical changes that don\u2019t match someone\u2019s gender identity,\" according to St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital. They were first used in the U.S. for gender-affirming care in 2007, Rafferty said. But they have been prescribed in Europe at least since the mid-1990s to treat adolescents with persistent gender dysphoria. The medication gives children time to explore their identities and consider additional treatment options. Research, including a 22-year follow-up study, shows that medication helps alleviate psychological distress in adolescence and supports a child\u2019s development into adulthood. Puberty blockers contain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, which suppress the body\u2019s release of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. Although puberty blockers weren't designed for gender-affirming care, their use for this purpose has been studied and isn't considered \"experimental\" by experts. \"\u2018Experimental\u2019 in this context is a political term designed to create drama, confusion, and terror,\" said Forcier. \"Medical care is always being evaluated and studied so we can provide the best care.\" Every medication has side effects, Arrington-Sanders said, but doctors monitor the side effects of medications used to suppress puberty. Studies demonstrate the long-term efficacy and positive impacts that gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers has on transgender youth, said C.P. Hoffman, senior policy counsel at the National Center for Transgender Equality. Hoffman pointed to a gender dysphoria research overview by doctors and researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Children\u2019s Medical Center Dallas and other institutions. The researchers noted that studies in 2015 and 2022 found that puberty blockers helped young people with gender dysphoria. California state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, discusses his proposed measure to provide legal refuge to displaced transgender youth and their families on March 17, 2022, at a news conference in Sacramento, California. (AP) Feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapies might be another element of gender-affirming care that may be recommended when a patient is capable of giving informed consent \u2014 around age 16, according to the Endocrine Society. Like puberty blockers, gender-affirming hormone therapy medications aren\u2019t approved specifically for gender affirmation use, and instead are approved and commonly used for contraception, managing menopause, for male pattern baldness and more. But the hormones themselves are \"considered safe (and) effective, especially when medically monitored,\" said Forcier of Brown University. Substantial evidence shows that access to gender-affirming hormone therapies when young reduces the long-term risk of suicide, anxiety, depression and gender dysphoria. Gender-affirming surgeries are typically recommended for and provided to adults. Certain gender-affirming surgeries, such as masculinizing chest surgery, are sometimes provided to teenagers, though this is rare. There is not much research on the long-term impact they have on adolescents, Rafferty said. Some things about gender-affirming care, such as how it affects fertility, are still being researched. But experts said this is the nature of medicine and pediatrics. Rafferty said, \"When most people hear \u2018experimental\u2019 they feel it means that providers do not know what they are doing or (are) guessing when making clinical decisions.\" But additional studies and research happen routinely to learn more about a topic and to develop better practices and standards of care. An Instagram post claimed, \"All \u2018gender affirming care\u2019 for children is 100% experimental. There are zero long term studies on the effects the drugs and surgeries will have on them.\" Experts said it is inaccurate to call all gender-affirming care for children \"experimental,\" because the approach, including the use of puberty blockers, is evidence-based. Research also shows that gender-affirming care reduces the risk of suicide, anxiety, depression and gender dysphoria. For prepubescent children, gender-affirming care does not involve medication or surgeries; instead, it\u2019s about social affirmation such as allowing a child to wear gender-affirming clothes or adopt a gender-affirming hairstyle. There\u2019s an element of truth to the claim: There aren\u2019t many long-term studies on the effects of gender-affirming surgeries for youth, but that\u2019s because they aren\u2019t done on children and rarely on teenagers.

        "doc": "STORY UPDATED: check for updates below.Did scientists claim the Wuhan coronavirus is an HIV-1 engineered hybrid \"superweapon\"? No, that's not true: The scientific research cited in a video making the claim has not been peer-reviewed, and the authors have withdrawn the paper, saying they intend to revise their interpretation of the results.The claim originated from a post (archived here) published by STFN Reloaded on February 1, 2020, under the title \"BREAKING: WUHAN SUPER VIRUS IS HIV-1 ENGINEERED HYBRID SCIENTISTS CLAIM - AVOID SUPER BOWL.\" It opened:BREAKING: WUHAN SUPER VIRUS IS HIV-1 ENGINEERED HYBRID SCIENTISTS CLAIM - AVOID SUPER BOWL EVENTSUsers on social media saw this:The narrator of the video makes several claims that he ties to a research paper from scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology and the University of Delhi, both in New Delhi, India.The paper claimed that the researchers found an \"uncanny\" similarity between the Wuhan coronavirus and HIV-1:We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV- 1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag.The video used this research as the basis of its claim that the novel coronavirus is a so-called \"superweapon\" that is going to spread HIV around the world. The narrator said:It spreads in the air like the flu and kinda gives you AIDS, that's basically the short description of this virus.He went on to say that the \"enemy has landed\" in the form of the coronavirus:It's invisible, it's in your town, but it's here now.The narrator called his video a \"public service announcement\" and urged people to avoid sharing \"chips and dip\" at parties during the Super Bowl.Never mind that this is not what the scientists in India are suggesting. They never claimed the latest coronavirus was a \"superweapon\" or that it would spread HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.The scientists concluded, \"Our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation.\"Crucially, the Indian study was not peer-reviewed by others in the scientific community, and a disclaimer noted \"these are preliminary reports\":They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information.After posting their research, the authors withdrew their paper and added this comment to a discussion post:This is a preliminary study. Considering the grave situation, it was shared in BioRxiv as soon as possible to have creative discussion on the fast evolution of SARS-like corona viruses. It was not our intention to feed into the conspiracy theories and no such claims are made here. While we appreciate the criticisms and comments provided by scientific colleagues at BioRxiv forum and elsewhere, the story has been differently interpreted and shared by social media and news platforms. We have positively received all criticisms and comments. To avoid further misinterpretation and confusions world-over, we have decided to withdraw the current version of the preprint and will get back with a revised version after reanalysis, addressing the comments and concerns. Thank you to all who contributed in this open-review process.It remains to be seen whether their research may offer valuable clues or insights into the origin of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 300 people and infected more than 14,000 others, according to The New York Times. The virus originated in Wuhan, China, more than a week ago, and more than two dozen countries have confirmed cases.Video posts such as this one are not sharing new information on the outbreak. Instead, they are fear-mongering the public and spreading conspiracy theories that have already been debunked.Update (February 4, 2020):On January 31, 2020, Anand Ranganathan, a Ph.D., an associate professor at the Special Centre for Molecular Medicine at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India, tweeted that the scientists \"hint\" at the possibility the Wuhan coronavirus was designed in a laboratory. He linked to the study mentioned in this article.He has since deleted that tweet and linked to a blog post titled, \"No, the 2019-nCoV genome doesn't really seem engineered from HIV.\"n/n This is an excellent and comprehensive rebuttal to the Indian study.In light of it, I think it is prudent to delete my tweet, leaving behind the question whether one should publish non-peer reviewed studies in fast-moving, in-public-eye domains. https://t.co/2VOGRcpnOf -- Anand Ranganathan (@ARanganathan72) February 1, 2020The author of that blog post, Ari Allyn-Feuer, refuted the paper, writing:...despite this new paper's language, a random sequence overlap is still the leading explanation for sequence alignment it identifies with HIV. Take this to the bank: 2019-nCoV continues to give every appearance of being a wild coronavirus that jumped from bats to humans by way of an animal intermediary in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan in late 2019. It is not an escaped bioweapon.Allyn-Feuer added that he has a Ph.D. in bioinformatics and that he is \"a principal data scientist at a major pharmaceutical company. This paper isn't directly in my wheelhouse, but it's pretty close,\" he said.Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at KU Leuven, Belgium's oldest university, also criticized the paper. In a tweet, he said:I did the analysis myself, using a multiple alignment of many more sars-like bat coronaviruses, and the 'insertion' is present already in these viruses. Furthermore, I don't see any evidence of the insertions being HIV-related.Bad science. -- Marc Van Ranst (@vanranstmarc) January 31, 2020In a separate blog post, Dr. Grant Jacobs also urged people to exercise caution about reading into \"pre-print\" studies.

        "claim": "Cuts to Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions since 2005 are similar to those achieved in the EU.",
        "doc": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia\u2019s reduction in carbon emissions of more than 20 per cent since 2005 is \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with that of the European Union. However, a comparison of Australia and EU emissions data shows that\u2019s not the case. Speaking to the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on November 10, 2021, the prime minister said : \u201cAustralia has already reduced our emissions by more than 20 per cent\u2026 \u2026 a 20 per cent fall is broadly in line with what\u2019s being achieved across the EU.\u201d The speech also appeared as a column in the Herald Sun newspaper on November 11 (page 48). According to the UN climate change time series , a database of emissions output for 43 countries, the EU cut emissions by 22.5 per cent between 2005-2019 compared with a 15.2 per cent reduction for Australia. The UN data shows between 2005 and 2019, Australia\u2019s GHG net emissions reduced from 612,049 kilotonnes (kt) to 518,865kt while EU net emissions dropped from 4,923,959kt to 3,814,473kt. When AAP FactCheck asked the prime minister\u2019s office for the basis of the claim that Australia\u2019s reductions were \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with achievements across the EU, a spokesperson for the PM provided the following statement: \u201cBetween 2005 and 2019, Australia (-15%) achieved a similar or greater reduction in emissions than sixteen European countries, including Austria (-8%), Belgium (-19%), Czech Republic (-2%), France (-19%), Germany (-20%), Hungary (-17%), Iceland (+4%), Latvia (+95%), Lithuania (-19%), Luxembourg (-16%), Netherlands (-15%), Norway (-7%), Poland (+6%), Ireland (-16%), Slovenia (+30%) and Switzerland (-16%). \u201cLooking forward to 2030, Australia is projected to achieve a similar per capita reduction to the EU.\u201d The list from the PM\u2019s office does not include all 27 EU countries and some in the list \u2013 Switzerland, Norway and Iceland \u2013 are not EU members. The emissions information is drawn from data reported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which at the time of writing covers annual emissions up to 2019. The data from the prime minister\u2019s office showed only a 15 per cent reduction for Australia in the period up to 2019 and not the \u201cmore than 20 per cent\u201d referred to by Mr Morrison. However the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources publishes GHG quarterly updates of Australian emissions going back to September 1999. These quarterly updates do not exactly match UN figures due to differences in how emissions are measured, seasonal adjustments and revisions that may occur. Using the Australian GHG data, Australia recorded a 20.5 per cent drop in emissions, from 625.2Mt (million tonnes CO2-equivalent) in 2005 to 497.3Mt in 2020, using seasonally adjusted calendar years. Global emissions fell sharply in 2020 due to COVID-19 . Professor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at ANU\u2019s Crawford School of Public Policy , told AAP FactCheck in an email that Australian emissions were lower than usual in 2020 because of lockdowns as well as more renewable energy entering the grid. Comparable data including 2020 for the EU shows the Europeans still cut emissions at a faster rate than Australia. A 2021 European Environment Agency report shows (Fig 1.1) that the EU cut its emissions from 4639Mt to an estimated 3377Mt over the same period \u2013 a reduction of around 27 per cent. The Verdict The prime minister\u2019s claim is complicated by differing timelines and datasets but a basic assessment shows that Australia\u2019s emissions reduction efforts are behind those of the EU as a whole. Against a range of European countries selected by the PM\u2019s office, Australia\u2019s emissions reduction is in the middle of the pack.

        "doc": "A video widely shared on Facebook warned about a widespread ban on domestic travel. \"Something big is happening right now,\" said the man in the video posted Aug. 21 on Facebook. \"We have over a million people right now that are under emergency travel restrictions \u2014 emergency travel restrictions, and this is due to poison being released into the air. This is what the federal government is warning right now.\" This post was flagged as part of Meta\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Patrick Humphrey made the video, first posted Aug. 20 on YouTube. The content is emblematic of a larger theme on Humphrey\u2019s YouTube channel: He regularly posts videos about alleged emergencies and encourages people to prepare for them. But his claims do not hold up under scrutiny. Humphrey has 91,000 subscribers, and his videos typically receive thousands of views. He has made other similar claims that PolitiFact has debunked, including one about \"massive explosions\" and another about an official statement from the White House regarding critical infrastructure. (Screenshot from YouTube.) In the Aug. 20 video, Humphrey said officials issued warnings encouraging people not to get fuel, to stay inside and avoid travel. The video\u2019s title claimed 1.2 million people in multiple states were told not to travel because poison was \"released in air.\" About two minutes into the video, Humphrey said, \"I\u2019ll tell you what they\u2019re saying it is, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s all it is, because I am not feeling good.\" After three and a half minutes, he mentioned \"air action warnings.\" Nearly four minutes passed before he provided bits of specific information by reading from two articles: An Aug. 18 Yahoo News article about an Aug. 20 ozone air quality alert in southwest Ohio. It provided tips for reducing air pollution, such as \"avoid driving if possible\" and \"mow your lawn in the evening.\" What appeared to be an Aug. 20 article in the Evansville, Indiana, Courier & Press newspaper about the Indiana Department of Environmental Management\u2019s declaration that Aug. 21 would be an air quality alert day in southwestern Indiana because of high ozone levels. The article encouraged people to \"drive less\" and \"avoid refueling your vehicle.\" Humphrey also mentioned that part of Colorado was under an air quality alert Aug. 20, but he did not show news reports of specific guidelines issued for that area. Neither article mentions a travel ban or says people would be prohibited from moving freely in Ohio or Indiana. We found no other evidence such as news articles or government press releases about travel restrictions in those states. The recommendations to \"avoid driving\" or \"drive less\" were the only apparent connections to what Humphrey called \"travel restrictions.\" Humphrey even acknowledged the guidelines were nonbinding. \"It\u2019s not \u2018mandatory\u2019 right now, it\u2019s \u2018voluntary\u2019 right now,\" he said, putting air quotes around the words. We rate the claim that \"over a million people right now that are under emergency travel restrictions\" because of \"poison being released into the air\" False.",

        "doc": "A widely shared Facebook post claims to show a student in Sweden killed by a \"Syrian refugee\" classmate after he defended another female classmate against sexual harassment. Text accompanying the purported image of the student says: \"Hi, my name is Arminas Pileckas. I'm a 15-year old student in Sweden. I protected a girl in my class who was sexually harassed by a 14-year old Syrian refugee. The Syrian killed me by stabbing me in the back because I insulted his honor. Neither the boy or his parents are facing any charges.\" It's correct that in January 2016 a 15 year-old boy, Arminas Pileckas, who was reportedly originally from Lithuania, was stabbed and killed by another student at a school in Broby, Sweden. But no one has been able to confirm to us the motive behind the attack. The student who attacked him was reportedly 14 years old but media reports from the time confirm little else about him. An interview with the suspect's father in Al Kompis (an Arabic language media organisation primarily operating in Sweden) reported that the boy was originally from Syria. Shortly after Arminas Pileckas died, Swedish police said they didn't know exactly what lay behind the attack, but that they didn't think it was random and they believed there was an ongoing conflict between the two boys. A number of possible motives were reported at the time , from ongoing bullying between the two boys, to an altercation involving another student in the school. We've asked police in Sweden for more information. The 14 year-old who carried out the attack wasn't prosecuted as he was below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden (which is 15 years old ). An article about the case by Snopes in January 2019 cited Nils Karlsson, a member of the municipal council in the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6. He said of the suspect: \"He was turned over to social services and they operate under very strict secrecy. So those who know more about the case are forbidden by law to talk about it.\"",

        "claim": "Says that at Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally in El Paso, there were \"200 people, 300 people.\"",
        "doc": "President Donald Trump loves to trumpet the sizes of the crowds at his rallies (and his inauguration, incorrectly). He also likes to belittle those of his political rivals. On Feb. 11, Trump went to the border city of El Paso, Texas, to tout his get-tough policies on immigration. On the same night, Beto O\u2019Rourke, a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who previously represented El Paso in the U.S. House, spoke to a crowd elsewhere in El Paso. During his speech, Trump mocked the turnout of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s event. Trump described O\u2019Rourke as \"a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name.\" Trump added, \"He challenged us. So we had, let's say 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people. Not too good.\" Was it true that just \"200 people, 300 people\" attended O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speech? We may never know the exact number of attendees -- we sought an official estimate from the El Paso Police Department and the city government of El Paso, but none was provided by publication time. Media reports suggested the number was in the thousands. For instance, the Texas Tribune reporters in El Paso wrote that \"about 7,000 people went to see O'Rourke speak at the park, according to an aide, who cited law enforcement.\" (The White House did not respond to a request for information.) Still, after reviewing photographic and video footage of the event, we conclude that the number was definitely higher than the 200 to 300 Trump said. Consider video footage distributed by O\u2019Rourke on Twitter. Here\u2019s a freeze-frame showing the middle of the crowd from the perspective of the podium: Panning to the left, we see that the crowd continues (we\u2019ve cropped it to avoid duplication): And if you pan further left, there\u2019s still more (also cropped to avoid duplication): Meanwhile, a livestream video published by the El Paso Times has a different, and more narrow, perspective -- facing the stage. But even this view suggests a crowd of more than just 200 or 300 people. As for the question of whether 35,000 people attended Trump\u2019s rally, news reports suggest that law enforcement officials disagree with his estimate. An El Paso Fire Department spokesman told the El Paso Times that the venue where Trump was speaking holds 6,500 people for that type of event, and it was filled to capacity. A few thousand more might have been standing outside, fire public information officer Enrique D. Aguilar told the newspaper, though there was no official countmade of the outside crowd. This would mean that the total crowd size \"might be 10,000 with the people outside,\" Aguilar told the paper. Other reported estimates were a few thousand higher. Either way, those estimates were well below Trump\u2019s total. (We will update this article if an official government estimate is released.) Trump said that at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally in El Paso, there were \"200 people, 300 people.\" Our review of the available visual evidence suggests that the number is clearly several times that. Media reports suggest the number may have been much larger still, in the thousands. We rate the statement False.",

        "doc": "In November 2020, President-elect Joe Biden suffered a hairline fracture in his right foot while playing with his dog, Major, requiring him to temporarily wear an orthopedic boot. The appearance of the walking boot prompted plenty of baseless online speculation, including the conspiracy theory \u2014 which we addressed in greater depth previously \u2014 that Biden was just the latest high-profile public figure to be caught engaging in child sex trafficking and forced to wear an ankle monitor, with the boot designed to cover up the monitor. In early December, another entirely baseless claim emerged, this time that Biden, supposedly while engaging in the deception of wearing an orthopedic boot, had absent-mindedly put it on the wrong foot. On Dec. 2, 2020, Facebook user Kris Sun posted two side-by-side pictures of Biden: one showing him with a gray boot on his left foot, and the other showing him wearing a black boot on his right foot: On Dec. 7, a TikTok user who regularly posts right-wing and pro-Trump memes and tropes posted a video that contrasted the same two photographs: Biden with a gray boot on his left foot; and Biden with a black boot on his right foot. She added the following caption: \u201cSleepy Joe did you forget which ankle was fractured?\u201d In reality, the picture of Biden wearing a gray boot on his left foot was digitally manipulated, and the the claim the president-elect had \u201cforgotten\u201d which foot was broken, and put his boot on the wrong foot, was entirely false. The original photograph was taken outside the Delaware Humane Association in November 2018 and shows Biden taking Major home after adopting him, a somewhat ironic twist, given the cause of Biden\u2019s broken foot, two years later. Malicious or mischievous internet users later digitally added the orthopedic boot, as well as a fake face mask, in order to give the doctored image a veneer of COVID-19-era authenticity: To further underscore the authenticity of the original photograph, the Delaware Humane Association\u2019s Facebook account also posted video footage of Biden taking Major home. The second picture in the misleading December 2020 memes \u2014 the one showing Biden with a black boot on his right foot \u2014 was authentic. It was taken by Getty Images photographer Alex Wong in Wilmington, Delaware, on Dec. 1: ",

(Read more about PolitiFact\u2019s partnership with TikTok.) The Wall Street Journal article the social media posts refer to does not mention Biden at all. The June 22 report includes information from U.S. Navy officials regarding the Titan implosion. Shortly after the Titan began its June 18 voyage to see the Titanic shipwreck in the North Atlantic ocean, the submersible lost contact with its surface ship. The U.S. Coast Guard immediately began coordinating a search and rescue mission with the U.S. Navy and Canadian authorities. We value what you have to say. Take PolitiFact\u2019s 2023 survey, and your answers will help us understand how we can meet your needs in the future. Officials told The Wall Street Journal that top secret military equipment designed to spot enemy submarines first heard what the Navy suspected was the Titan\u2019s implosion June 18 soon after communication with the submersible was lost. At the time, the Navy couldn\u2019t definitely determine that the sound had come from the Titan, so the search and rescue mission continued, officials said. On June 22, debris from the submersible was found about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic wreckage, the Coast Guard said. The same day, officials announced that the five men aboard the Titan were dead. The Wall Street Journal article did not address whether the president knew about the implosion before Navy officials publicly confirmed its occurrence June 22. We rate the claim that the Wall Street Journal reported that Biden knew June 18 that the Titan had imploded but withheld the news until June 22 False.",

Vishvas News (New Delhi): A post going viral on social media shows the picture of a young woman. It is being claimed that in Prayagraj (earlier Allahabad), Sheesha Sahu killed two rapists to save herself. Vishvas News investigated the viral post and found it to be fake. Prayagraj Police also denied any such incident and called the viral post as fake. Claim Facebook user Shiv Charan Maurya claimed in a post shared on August 23rd writing: \u201cSheesha Sahu, a 16-year-old girl from Allahabad, killed two rapists to save herself!\u201d A picture of a young woman holding a sword was also uploaded with the post. The archived version of the Facebook post can be viewed here. Investigation Vishvas News started its investigation using Google reverse image search tool. We found the original image on a Facebook page named Sadhvi Saraswati. There were many such pictures in which Sadhvi can be seen holding a sword. As stated in her social media account, she lives in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh. Thousands of people follow her page. Vishvas News did a Google search using the viral post\u2019s claim as a keyword. We found a tweet made from the Twitter handle of Prayagraj Police on August 19, 2020, refuting the viral claim. Such claims had gone viral earlier as well. It was clearly written by the police that the news going viral on social media is completely untrue and misleading. Vishvas News contacted Rajendra Yadav, crime reporter of Dainik Jagran, Prayagraj to investigate further. He said that the viral post is fake and had gone viral earlier as well. Prayagraj SP Crime Ashutosh Mishra also denied the viral post. We also came to know that last year i.e. in August 2020, in Taktaiya village of Karchana police station area of Prayagraj district, a family had killed two real brothers in a dispute over tying animals on the road. Later the police arrested all the three accused. There was no rape angle in the news. Jagran.com report dated August 8, 2020, can be read by clicking here. We scanned the profile of the Facebook user Shiv Charan Maurya who shared the fake post. We found that the user is a resident of Varanasi in UP. He has more than 400 friends. Conclusion: Vishvas News investigated the viral post and found it to be fake. Prayagraj Police also denied any such rape incident and called the viral post as fake.

        "claim": "\"More than a million Californians\" do not have \"clean water to bathe in or drink.\"",
        "doc": "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has made confronting California\u2019s contaminated drinking water a top priority early in his term in office. In his first week, he took his cabinet on a road trip to meet with Central Valley residents who, for years, have had to rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking. In his budget, he called for a tax on drinking water to help disadvantaged communities clean up contaminated water. Then he signed one of his first pieces of legislation to provide assistance to communities with unsafe water, including $10 million for emergency drinking water projects. During his State of the State Address, Newsom called California\u2019s safe drinking water crisis \"a moral disgrace and a medical emergency.\" He added this assertion: \"Just this morning, more than a million Californians woke up without clean water to bathe in or drink.\" Is the problem this widespread? We decided to fact-check Newsom\u2019s claim. Our research Clean drinking water advocates and researchers told us Newsom\u2019s statement is correct, but noted it\u2019s an estimate based on incomplete data, and that the actual number could be higher. \"It\u2019s worse,\" said Jonathan London, a UC Davis professor who\u2019s written about contaminated drinking water. The professor said one millionwould be \"an underestimate.\" In the San Joaquin Valley alone, there were nearly 100,000 residents living without access to clean drinking water, according to a February 2018 UC Davis study London co-authored. \"Unfortunately, (Newsom\u2019s) number is true,\u2019 added Kelsey Hinton, spokesperson for the Community Water Center, a San Joaquin Valley nonprofit that advocates for clean drinking water. As evidence, both London and Hinton pointed to a 2017 drinking water compliance report by the State Water Resources Control Board, which regulates water quality. The report shows that an estimated 592,000 Californians lived in a public water district that received a water quality violation in 2017. But that doesn\u2019t include people living in private, unregulated districts. London said some of the violations are worse than others, such as those involving arsenic, nitrates or uranium contaminates. Some of the violations, he added, could be less severe. \"All violations have some kind of health risk associated,\" he added. California Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered his first State of the State Address on Feb. 12, 2018. AP photo. Not everyone is counted Hinton said on top of those living in regulated districts, there are many thousands more who live in small, rural communities that rely on unregulated private wells. Some of those wells also experience contamination, but aren\u2019t counted in the water board report. A McClatchy investigation published in June 2018 found at least 6 million Californians are served by water providers that have been in violation of state standards at some point since 2012. Darrin Polhemus, deputy director for the water board's division of drinking water, said Newsom\u2019s figure is accurate based on a tally this month of the regulated, public water systems alone. That report includes violations for an additional contaminant, the cancer-causing man-made chemical Trichloropropane, referred to as 1,2,3,-TCP. The addition of that contaminant boosts the number of people living in a regulated district to \"now over one million people,\" he said. \"The estimated population \u2026 of the public water systems regulated by the State Water Board that are currently out of compliance is 1,081,328,\" Polhemus said in an email.\"This number increased recently because we added those systems that are now out of compliance with our 1,2,3-TCP Maximum Contaminant Level.\" Our ruling Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed \"more than a million Californians\" don\u2019t have \"clean water to bathe in or drink.\" A group that advocates for clean drinking water and a UC Davis researcher agreed with Newsom\u2019s figure, with the researcher saying the number is significantly higher than one million. They pointed to a state water board report showing nearly 600,000 people lived in a regulated public water district that received a water quality violation in 2017. They noted that many thousands more people live in districts with unregulated and contaminated private wells but are not counted on the water board\u2019s tally. The deputy director of the water board\u2019s drinking water division added that a report from this month, which adds violations for a new cancer-causing contaminant, boosts the number of people in regulated water districts alone to more than one million people. Based on this information, we rated Newsom\u2019s statement True. TRUE\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.

        "claim": "Says President Donald Trump is one of \"only three people that won the Ellis Island Award for their work within the black community.\"",
        "doc": "Some posts on social media are countering the accusations of racism against President Donald Trump after his tweet that a group of Democratic congresswomen should \"go back\" to the \"crime infested places from which they came.\" (All four are citizens, and only one, Rep. Ilhan Omar, was born outside of the U.S. before arriving when she was 10.) One post points to Trump\u2019s business history in New York as evidence that he looks out for minorities. The post, in full, reads: \"There are only 3 people that won the Ellis Island Award for their work within the black community \u2026 1. Rosa Parks 2. Muhammad Ali 3. Donald Trump \u2026 yet \u2018squad\u2019 wants you to believe he\u2019s racist.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim gets one major thing wrong: While Donald Trump did win the award, called the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, it was not for \"work within the black community.\" We reached out to the Ellis Island Honors Society, which administers the award. The society is a non-political organization promoting diversity and understanding among religious and ethnic groups, as well as the restoration and maintenance of Ellis Island. Spokesperson Otto Coca told PolitiFact that Trump was one of several people to be awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1986 \u2013 the first year it was given out (and the same year Parks and Ali were also recipients). Trump was chosen for professional contributions that benefited New York City as a developer, as well as for his German heritage. \"That post is ridiculous and an outright lie,\" Coca said. In the first year, \"people were honored with the award for what they stood for more than what they did,\" Coca said. Parks, for example, was honored for standing up to adversity. Trump\u2019s recognition came from \"doing well for the city of New York\" from his business. The medal has changed over the years, Coca said, and now recipients are chosen for philanthropic efforts as well as other contributions. According to an Oct. 16, 1986, New York Times article, those named for the award were selected from more than 15,000 nominations. The winners, the article says, were a \"mixture of prominent and relatively unknown citizens,\" and were screened by the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations. The article lists Trump as a recipient, with \"German developer\" alongside his name. A photograph taken on Oct. 27, 1986, by Getty photographer Yvonne Hemsey shows Trump standing alongside Parks and Ali at a ceremony honoring the recipients. Joe DiMaggio, Victor Borge and Anita Bryant also appear in the picture. \"It had nothing to do with race,\" Coca said about the photograph. \"They were all honored for different reasons and they were just all standing together, that\u2019s the only reason that picture exists.\" A popular post spreading on social media claims that Trump \"was one of only three people to win an Ellis Island award for \u2018work within the black community.\u2019\" Trump was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1986, but he was not honored for being one of a handful of recipients who helped the black community \u2013 it was for his contributions in real estate. Since then, the Ellis Island Honor Society has honoredaround 100 Americans each year. We rate this post False.",

        "claim": "Under the House Republican tax proposal, \"the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year.\"",
        "doc": "House Republicans have touted their tax bill as a plus for typical American families. In a constituent email forwarded to us by a reader, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson wrote, \"This week the House released our tax reform legislation to help American families and level the playing field for the American worker. With this plan, the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year. Who wouldn't want American families to have more money in their pockets?\" The statement is exaggerating how long the average family of four will enjoy those tax savings. Ferguson\u2019s office said that he had been citing comment from House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose office told us in a related check that the speaker had been referring to a House Ways and Means Committee analysis. That analysis calculated several scenarios for how the proposal\u2019s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements of the Ways and Means calculation involved tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example refers to a \"family of four making $59,000 per year.\" Here\u2019s the scenario outlined in the House\u2019s fact sheet, using the fictional example of \"Steve and Melinda\" with two middle school-aged children: \"As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. \"That\u2019s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it\u2019s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future.\" The Ways and Means Committee told PolitiFact that they chose a household income of $59,000 because it\u2019s the median household income nationally. For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That\u2019s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ferguson has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Here are the two clearest caveats. The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren\u2019t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. For households earning around $59,000 a year, more taxpayers do take the standard deduction than take itemized deductions -- but a significant minority, about one-third, do itemize. For many itemizing taxpayers, those deductions are important -- and under the tax bill, they\u2019re likely to end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. Ferguson\u2019s statement explicitly said that the $1,182 income boost would happen \"every year.\" The problem is that the benefits of the tax proposal shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade for this family. \"The tax cut definitely dissipates over time,\" David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin\u2019s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here\u2019s the graph he put together: The way Ferguson described the cut was actually stronger than Ryan\u2019s tax cut of \"$1,182 a year.\" Amy Timmerman, Ferguson\u2019s communications director, said that \"the congressman misspoke last week when he cited Speaker Ryan\u2019s example.\" Ferguson said that under the House Republican tax proposal, \"the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year.\" This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ferguson glossed over some context. The calculation doesn\u2019t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some \"typical\" families around that income level. And the statement is misleading when it says the family will save $1,182 \"every year,\" since that\u2019s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True. EDITORS' NOTE, Nov. 6, 2017: We updated this story to remove a reference to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of the tax plan. That plan is now under review by TPC and the organization asked journalists to refrain from quoting the report until it is revised.",

        "claim": "The Covid-19 vaccines are a mass clinical trial and won't get to phase 3 trials until 2023.",
        "doc": "A video shared online features a former health worker making a number of false claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, and vaccines. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in \"Covid has never been isolated in a laboratory. It has never been proven to exist. The only place it exists is in your head.\" This is incorrect. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As we have written previously, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in laboratories around the world many times since it was discovered. Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist and Associate Professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research, previously told Full Fact: \"SARS-CoV2 has been sampled millions of times over from infected people, including those originally found to be infected in China\". \"Up until 26th May 2021 since these vaccines have been rolled out there have been 888,196 adverse reactions. That's something mild to fatal. In the UK...there have been 1,253 deaths...and they're the deaths that are recorded where the hospitals or the doctors are actually acknowledging that this is the jab.\" We have written about the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme many times before . The UK's Yellow Card scheme collects and monitors safety concerns involving any medicines and medical devices such as suspected or potential side effects. This relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public and aims to provide an early warning that the safety of a medicine or a medical device may require further investigation. According to MHRA data up to 26 May 2021, there were around a quarter of a million Yellow Card reports for the Covid-19 vaccines.  Of those, there were 885,980 suspected reactions (because one Yellow Card may report multiple symptoms). These range from sore arms and 'flu like' symptoms to some of the more significant suspected reactions. It's correct that 1,253 deaths had been reported.  But we don't know that these reactions or deaths were caused by the vaccine, and they certainly aren't all cases where hospitals or doctors have agreed that it was the vaccine's fault. As explained by the MHRA \"It is very important to note that a Yellow Card report does not necessarily mean the vaccine caused that reaction or event. We ask for any suspicions to be reported, even if the reporter isn't sure if it was caused by the vaccine. Reports to the scheme are known as suspected adverse reactions (ADRs). \"Many suspected ADRs reported on a Yellow Card do not have any relation to the vaccine or medicine and it is often coincidental that they both occurred around the same time. The reports are continually reviewed to detect possible new side effects that may require regulatory action, and to differentiate these from things that would have happened regardless of the vaccine or medicine being administered, for instance due to underlying or undiagnosed illness.\" Specifically related to deaths reported to the Yellow Card scheme, the MHRA has said : \"Vaccination and surveillance of large populations means that, by chance, some people will experience and report a new illness or events in the days and weeks after vaccination\" and that thousands of deaths are expected to have occurred naturally within a few days of the millions of vaccine doses given so far, mostly in the elderly. On 7 April 2021, the MHRA issued a statement advising on a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a very rare and specific type of blood clot seen in the context of low platelets. As a precaution, because of the balance of risks from Covid-19 for young people, in addition to an individualised assessment of those who are at an increased risk of blood clots, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that people under the age of 40 in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine. As of 23 June 2021 , there have been 298,081 Yellow Cards reported for the Covid-19 vaccines, including just over a million suspected reactions. This included 1,403 deaths. \"Do you want to know what your survival rate is for taking this jab? 85% chance of survival.\" It's not quite clear what this claim means. A Google search of 85% in relation to Covid-19 vaccines directs you towards the results of studies into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people aged over 80. One, for example, is a Public Health England report into the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines in people over the age of 80. The report says that PHE data shows that two doses of vaccine have an effectiveness against mortality of around 85%. This means that they reduce the risk of dying from Covid-19. It does not mean that people who receive the vaccine only have an 85% chance of survival. As a quick sense check, if the 85% chance of survival was true, it would mean that 15% of people who received a Covid-19 vaccine died afterwards as a result. Given that up to 6 July 2021, roughly 45 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the UK, this would result in approximately seven million deaths\u2014which clearly hasn't happened. \"It's been approved by the government agency the MHRA but it hasn't gone through the full European standard. In America it is not FDA approved. This is a trial, a mass clinical trial and it is in phase two trials at the moment. It doesn't get to phase three trials until 2023.\" All three of the vaccines currently in use in the UK (Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna) have been authorised for use. A fourth, Janssen has been authorised, but is not yet in use. Across the UK, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has a temporary authorisation (sometimes known as a regulation 174 authorisation) issued by the MHRA . In Great Britain, the Oxford-AstraZeneca , Moderna and Janssen vaccines have another type of authorisation, called a \"conditional marketing authorisation\" which has been issued by the MHRA. We have written more about the difference between these types of authorisation before. The European Medicines Agency has authorised the use of all four of these vaccines, under its own conditional marketing authorisation . It is under these authorisations that the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines are made available in Northern Ireland. As we have written previously, the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines have all had analysis of safety and efficacy data from phase three trials (involving tens of thousands of participants) published in peer-reviewed articles in medical journals such as The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. Long-term protection and safety data will continue to be collected over the next couple of years, and so the completion dates for the trials are in 2022 and 2023. The FDA has also authorised the use of the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. \"It's actually in breach of the Nuremberg Code.\" It's not clear whether it is being claimed that the vaccines themselves or the act of giving them is in breach of the ethical research principles that were developed in the wake of Nazi attrocities. Either way, as we've written before , medical ethics, healthcare law and social epidemiology experts have told us that the principles of the Nuremberg Code are not applicable to the current vaccine roll-out.",

        "claim": "Says New Jersey\u2019s job growth in May represents \"25 percent of all the jobs created in the country.\"",
        "doc": "For those Democrats questioning whether to cut taxes, Gov. Chris Christie has a statistic to prove his \"Jersey Comeback\" is real: the Garden State in May created one out of every four net new jobs in the nation.Christie offered that statistic during a June 14 press conference as one of the \"real facts\" Democrats should address.\"Fact is, it is time for a tax cut in this state,\" said Christie, according to a video posted June 15 on YouTube. \"It is long overdue for a tax cut in this state, and I hope that today they stop with the make-believe and start addressing the real facts, which are that New Jersey is the single biggest job producer last month of any state in the country -- 25 percent of all the jobs created in the country right here.\"But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie was making an invalid comparison of federal labor statistics.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced June 1 that the nation had seen a net increase of 69,000 nonfarm jobs in May, accounting for both job gains and losses. State officials said June 14 that New Jersey saw an over-the-month increase in May of 17,600 nonfarm jobs. Both figures are preliminary and seasonally adjusted.Christie\u2019s mistake was claiming that the 17,600 jobs in New Jersey were part of that 69,000 for the nation. The most valid comparison would be to consider New Jersey\u2019s 17,600 jobs as a share of the job gains across the country in May, according to Doug Hall, director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.In May, a total of 184,500 jobs were created in 27 states and Washington, D.C. Of that amount, New Jersey\u2019s growth represents about 9.5 percent.Those statistics, which were released by the bureau the day after Christie\u2019s press conference, also show that California and Ohio saw greater job gains in May than New Jersey. So, Christie\u2019s wrong to say \"New Jersey is the single biggest job producer last month of any state.\"Brian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, argued that at the time of the governor\u2019s statement, Christie only had \"the net national gain of 69,000 jobs against which to compare the state numbers.\"\"I understand your point that the comparison made is not recommended by the BLS,\" Murray said in an e-mail. \"But I think you should consider that it was not until June 15, a day after the Governor made his remarks, that the public and Governor\u2019s Office could have seen the full BLS numbers on national figures and other states like California.\"Christie may not have had the additional labor statistics, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he made a flawed comparison with the publicly available figures at his disposal.Our rulingAt his June 14 press conference, Christie claimed New Jersey\u2019s over-the-month increase of 17,600 jobs in May represented \"25 percent of all the jobs created in the country.\"The governor was comparing the state\u2019s job growth to the national estimate of 69,000 net jobs created. But according to the bureau, state estimates and the national estimate are developed separately, making it wrong to compare the two.We rate the statement False.

A press release issued by the Chief Minister\u2019s office on the same can be found here. None of the reports mentioned a cash award. Moreover, in an interview, Zareen\u2019s mother thanked Telangana CM for providing financial assistance in 2014.

        "claim": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus was engineered in a laboratory and deliberately released",
        "doc": "CLAIM The SARS-CoV-2 virus was engineered in a laboratory and deliberately released more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Li-Meng Yan, AnonHQ.com, The Joe Hoft Show, 30 Apr. 2022 DETAILS Inadequate support: To date, scientific evidence indicates that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is a product of natural evolution, not genetic engineering. Yan didn\u2019t provide any evidence to support her claims that the virus was genetically engineered and deliberately released. KEY TAKE AWAY Claims that the virus SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a laboratory haven\u2019t been substantiated by evidence. The virus\u2019 genome and evolutionary trajectory are consistent with those of naturally-occurring viruses. Based on the scientific evidence so far, the consensus held by experts is that the virus most likely emerged naturally, by evolving in animals before later jumping to humans (zoonosis). FULL CLAIM: \u201cDr. Li-Meng Yan, a Chinese virologist, stated that the virus was \u2018no accident.\u2019 That it was lab-produced and released with intent\u201d; \u201cDr. Yan fled China after providing evidence that the COVID-19 virus was created in a laboratory\u201d REVIEW An article published by the website AnonHQ.com promoted claims by scientist Li-Meng Yan that the virus SARS-CoV-2 was engineered at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released on purpose by the Chinese government. This isn\u2019t the first time that Yan made unsubstantiated claims about the origin of COVID-19. In September 2020, Yan and her colleagues published a preprint, a paper that hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed by other scientists, claiming that \u201cgenetic evidence within the Spike gene of SARS-CoV-2\u201d suggested that the virus was genetically manipulated. The preprint was widely panned by experts; readers who are interested can find detailed scientific reviews of the preprint by MIT Rapid Reviews and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Nevertheless, Yan\u2019s claims reemerged following a 29 April 2022 interview of Yan by Joe Hoft, who publishes the Gateway Pundit, a website that promotes conspiracy theories and disinformation on subjects ranging from the Parkland School shooting to the U.S. presidential elections to COVID-19. That interview received more than 109,000 views and was also promoted by the Gateway Pundit in an article. Despite the claim that Yan \u201c[provided] evidence that the COVID-19 virus was created in a laboratory\u201d, present in both the AnonHQ.com and Gateway Pundit articles, she has yet to actually do so. She presented no new evidence during the interview for her claims. Health Feedback reached out to Yan to request her evidence, and will update this review if new information becomes available. Although the 2020 preprint by Yan and her colleagues provided a veneer of scientific evidence for her claims, experts who reviewed it pointed out several problems with their analysis. Health Feedback reviewed the preprint in detail here. For example, Yan cited the presence of \u201cunique restriction sites\u201d in SARS-CoV-2 as evidence of genetic manipulation. Restriction sites are specific sequences in the genome, recognized by proteins called restriction enzymes, that researchers use to cut and manipulate genes. But these sequences aren\u2019t unique to SARS-CoV-2. Virologist Kristian Andersen pointed out that the bat coronavirus RaTG also carries these sites, but Yan et al. had simply excluded it from consideration in their analyses. In fact, these sites occur commonly in nature: adenoviruses[1] and even plants[2] share some of the same restriction sites found in SARS-CoV-2. Yan also claimed that a previously identified bat coronavirus ZC45 likely provided the genetic backbone for engineering SARS-CoV-2. Several experts pointed out that this was implausible, as ZC45 was only 89% identical to SARS-CoV-2. Marvin Reitz, a virologist at the University of Maryland, stated in his review of the preprint: \u201c[I]t still would require more than 3,000 nucleotide substitutions [for ZC45] to become SARS-CoV-2. This is not even slightly credible; it beggars reason.\u201d Notwithstanding the criticism of the preprint, Yan and her colleagues published another preprint, this time claiming that known coronaviruses sharing genetic similarities to SARS-CoV-2 had simply been fabricated, in order to prop up the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 arose naturally. But Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Basel and co-developer of the Nextstrain project that studies the evolution of pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, pointed out that \u201cmost of the samples that Yan\u2019s group says are fake predate the start of the pandemic\u201d: \u201c\u2018This accusation implies there were years of coordination and fake sequence generation,\u201d Hodcroft said, adding: \u201cThis is an incredible claim, and would require a significant evidence burden to back it up, which is missing from the paper.\u2019\u201d To date, scientific evidence doesn\u2019t support the claim that the virus was engineered. Scientists have examined the virus for signs of genetic manipulation, but have found none. So far Yan and her colleagues have failed to produce convincing evidence to the contrary. During the interview with Joe Hoft, Yan also claimed that the virus was released intentionally by the Chinese government, once again without providing evidence to support her claim. This review refrains from assessing the veracity of this claim, because there is no evidence to either prove or disprove it. Similarly, the hypothesis that the virus was leaked from a laboratory still remains under consideration by scientists, as there is no evidence to support or refute it. But one thing that scientists have determined with a high degree of certainty, based on the scientific evidence so far, is that the virus is the product of natural evolution[3]. Its genetic features and evolutionary trajectory are consistent with those of naturally-occurring viruses and can already be explained by known evolutionary mechanisms. REFERENCES",

This search directed us to a news report by ABP Live dated December 6, 2022, that embedded the same viral video. According to the news report, the age of the elderly woman seen in the video is 93 years. In the video, she is dancing to Bollywood veteran Shammi Kapoor's song 'Badan Pe Sitare Lapete Huye'. Though the report does not mention that the elderly woman in the viral video is actress Vyjayanthimala.We searched further and found several media reports published in December 2022 stating that \"a video is going viral on social media, in which a 93-year-old grandmother is seen dancing with a lot of fun. She is seen doing a tremendous dance to Shammi Kapoor and Vyjayanti Mala's song 'O Jaane Tamanna Kidhar Ja Rahi Ho..'. This clearly means a different song has been digitally added to the vital video.We then searched for news related to actress Vyjayanthimala and found that she does not look like the woman seen in the viral video. BJP leader and actress Khushboo Sundar also tweeted her photo with Vyjayanthimala on 21 November 2022. According to IMDB information, Vyjayanthimala was born on August 13, 1933, which means that she's aged 89 years.Thus, it is evident from the above information that an unrelated video is falsely shared as Indian actress Vyjayanthimala dancing at the age of 99.If you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 11 7127 9799FAKE NEWS BUSTER Name Email Phone Picture/video Picture/video url Description \u0394Click here for Latest News updates and viral videos n our AI-powered smart news",

        "claim": "In 1975, then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden blocked aid to South Vietnam and did not allow admittance of Vietnamese refugees into the United States.",
        "doc": "As U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration took office in January 2021, Biden\u2019s past voting record came under scrutiny, leading to misrepresentations by some partisan critics. Since late 2020, we received inquiries from Snopes readers who pointed us to a section from Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s 2018 book, \u201cWhen the Center Held: Gerald Ford and the Rescue of the American Presidency,\u201d which they said reported that Biden was opposed to welcoming South Vietnamese refugees into the U.S. and to providing them aid at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Rumsfeld, who was Ford\u2019s secretary of defense at the time, recounted a meeting on April 14, 1975, between Ford and a number of senators surrounding the resettlement of refugees from South Vietnam: Meeting with a group of influential Senators, Ford repeatedly tried to sway them with what he believed deeply was our country\u2019s moral responsibility to help refugees fleeing persecution. Repeatedly, a number of Senate Democrats dissented, including the young outspoken Senator Joe Biden. [\u2026] Senator Biden of Delaware then spoke up and got back again on the delays in getting Americans out. He also expressed hostility towards the idea of bringing out any South Vietnamese. This recollection did not fully depict the context around Biden\u2019s disagreement. At the time, Biden was part of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A declassified transcript from the Ford Library Museum details the full conversation. In the discussion, Ford, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and a number of senators were debating evacuations of Americans, Vietnamese refugees, and military aid to Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u, who was president of South Vietnam (though he would resign a few days after this meeting): President: If there isn\u2019t some indication of aid, the situation could disintegrate rapidly. Sen. Jacob Javits (Republican): I will give you large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid for Thieu. Sen. Frank Church (Democrat): I would think that if money is required to facilitate getting the Americans out, that can be worked out. What has not been worked out is the Vietnamese evacuees. Secretary Kissinger has said maybe there are 175,000. Clearly there is no legal inhibition to bringing some out along with Americans, but 175,000, with American troops involved, could involve us in a very large war. This raises the specter of a new war, thousands of American troops holding on in an enclave for a long period. President: It is not envisaged that this would be for a long period but as quickly and precisely as possible. Biden: What concerns us is that a week ago [Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Philip] Habib told us we would be formulating a plan. A week has gone by and nothing has happened. We should focus on getting them out. Getting the Vietnamese out and military aid for the GVN [Government of South Vietnam] are totally different.[\u2026]Kissinger: The plan for American evacuation is in pretty good shape. But we had a report that if we pulled out and left them in the lurch, we may have to fight the South Vietnamese. It was that we were concerned with and that is why we waited to go to Thieu so we didn\u2019t do it in the context of a bug out. The second problem is getting American citizens out in an emergency. Third is the Vietnamese to whom we have an obligation. This is infinitely more complicated and large-scale. It requires cooperation from the GVN and maybe the North Vietnamese. Biden: I feel put upon in being presented an all or nothing number. I don\u2019t want to have to vote to buy it all or not at all. I am not sure I can vote for an amount to put American troops in for one to six months to get the Vietnamese out. I will vote for any amount for getting the Americans out. I don\u2019t want it mixed with getting the Vietnamese out.[\u2026]Sen. Hugh Scott (Republican): I agree to the proposal. One thing we haven\u2019t discussed is the amounts. I think we need to discuss a figure. Biden: I don\u2019t want to commit myself to any precise number. How much money depends on how many we try to get out. In the conversation, Biden was not arguing against refugees coming to the U.S., but instead was more concerned about details around the plan, particularly the specifics of military aid to the South Vietnamese government and funding for getting both Vietnamese refugees and Americans out. It is not clear in the statement \u201cWe should focus on getting them out\u201d whether Biden was talking about Vietnamese or U.S. troops. According to VietFact Check \u2014 a project run by PIVOT, a progressive Vietnamese American think tank\u2014 Biden was talking about the South Vietnamese. The conservative Washington Examiner claimed that he was talking about getting the U.S. troops out. On April 25, 1975, Biden opposed \u201cThe Vietnam Contingency Act of 1975\u201d which would send emergency funds to South Vietnam for evacuation and relief efforts. Biden expressed his concerns over how aid money intended for evacuation was going to be used, and the limits of the powers of the U.S. president. On April 23, 1975, in a speech on the Senate floor, Biden argued that the president had constitutional authority to evacuate U.S. citizens, but the evacuation of noncitizens was an entirely different matter that should be negotiated \u201cthrough organizations that are available, and through diplomatic channels that we could use.\u201d In the same speech in the Senate, he argued that \u201cthere is no question in anybody\u2019s mind [\u2026] that the bill\u2019s section 2, containing $100 million, labelled as a \u2018contingency fund\u2019 may not be, but clearly could be, used for military aid to the South Vietnamese government.\u201d He argued that $100 million in the evacuation contingency fund was \u201cnot a diplomatic channel,\u201d and would even \u201caggravate\u201d the situation, which he described as the North Vietnamese \u201c[continuing] to tighten their military noose around Saigon [\u2026] they are in a position today to interdict Tassonhut airport.\u201d Humanitarian aid, he said, should be sent through \u201cmultilateral organizations.\u201d The aid package eventually died on the House floor anyway, and days later the South Vietnamese capital fell to the North Vietnamese army. But in May 1975 Biden voted in favor of a resolution \u201cExpressing the sense of the Senate to welcome to the U.S. the latest refugees from South Vietnam and Cambodia.\u201d In late May 1975, Biden was not present to vote for H.R. 6755, the \u201cIndochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act,\u201d which is not the same as a \u201cNay\u201d vote. But as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he approved the bill in order to release it to the floor for a final vote. He, along with the majority of the committee, did so with an amendment and a \u201cfavorable recommendation.\u201d Many in the Vietnamese American community still believe that Biden did not support refugee resettlement and in October 2020, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, in a bid to attract their support, Biden addressed this in an op-ed in a Vietnamese language newspaper: I am very proud to support the historical law, which brought the first 130,000 refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to the United States in 1975 and passed a resolution welcoming them. I voted to increase the budget to help the new Vietnamese settle and I have co-sponsored [the law] that led to the formation of the immigration system under the current refugee status. Given that Biden was opposed to Ford providing more military and humanitarian aid to South Vietnam around the time the conflict was going in favor of the North Vietnamese over his concerns for how it would be used, but not opposed to refugee resettlement in the U.S. as well as aid for the resettlement of these refugees, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d",

One version of the post that the Facebook page \u201cPolitics Watchdog\u201d shared was viewed millions of times. This doctored footage (which can be viewed in part below) was created by slowing down a clip of Pelosi speaking at a Center for American Progress event to make her words seem garbled and slurred. Here\u2019s the original, unaltered video from C-SPAN: The video circulating as if it shows Pelosi drunk and slurring was created by taking a clip from the above-displayed footage and slowing it down by about 25%. Here\u2019s a video report from the Washington Post that shows these two videos side-by-side: Analyses of the distorted Center for American Progress video by Washington Post journalists and outside researchers indicate that the video has been slowed to about 75 percent of its original speed. To possibly correct for how that speed change would deepen her tone, the video also appears to have been altered to modify her pitch, to more closely resemble the sound of her natural speech.

        "claim": "Says David Rivera \"received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading.\"",
        "doc": "Miami Beach state Rep. Luis Garcia says that U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, took money from a peer accused of insider trading.\"Last week, Congressman David Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Actthat would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit. Rivera has received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading, and whose behavior is the target of the STOCK Act,\" said Garcia, a Democrat, in a Feb. 15 campaign press release. In a related report about whether Rivera \"allowed\" Republican leaders to soften the bill, we examined in detail the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which passed the Senate and House in February. Although insider trading by members of Congress is already illegal, the STOCK Act is a response to newspaper reports and academic research that raise suspicions that politicians on Capitol Hill use their unique access to information to make lucrative trades.The bill is intended to make it crystal clear that members can\u2019t inside trade, and it requires them to disclose their transactions within 30 to 45 days.In this item, we will explore whether Rivera received a $5,000 contribution from Bachus, who is under investigation for insider trading.For questions about the campaign donation, Rivera\u2019s congressional office spokeswoman referred us to a generic email address for Rivera\u2019s campaign, and we did not get a reply. We also tried to reach Rivera directly but were unsuccessful.First, some background about Rivera. A longtime state legislator, Rivera was elected to Congress in 2010 and now faces re-election in 2012. Rivera is the subject of a criminal probe by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service related to $510,000 in undisclosed payments from a former dog track to a company owned by his mother.The press release noted that Rivera received a contribution in 2010 from Bachus\u2019 Growth and Prosperity Political Action Committee. The PAC\u2019s report filed with the Federal Election Commission showed that it gave to multiple congressional campaigns, including $5,000 to Rivera\u2019s congressional campaign on May 13, 2010 (Rivera\u2019s FEC report shows that he received the donation June 24, 2010.)The Center for Responsive Politics shows a summary of donations by Bachus\u2019 Growth and Prosperity PAC -- it spent about $724,000, for the 2010 cycle. The contribution to Rivera\u2019s campaign was not among the top recipients or vendors.In November 2011, 60 Minutesaired a report inspired by the book Throw Them All Out, by Peter Schweizer, which cast a spotlight on Bachus,R-Ala., and his trades during the 2008 financial crisis. \"While Congressman Bachus was publicly trying to keep the economy from cratering, he was privately betting that it would, buying option funds that would go up in value if the market went down,\" the 60 Minutes report stated. \"He would make a variety of trades and profited at a time when most Americans were losing their shirts.\"The Washington Post reported on Feb. 9, 2012, that the Office of Congressional Ethics had launched an investigation of Bachus, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, over possible violations of insider-trading laws. Bachus \"has been a frequent trader on Capitol Hill, buying stock options while overseeing the nation\u2019s banking and financial services industries,\" the Post stated, explaining that it was the first investigation of its kind of a member of Congress. The Post wrote that the OCE has found probable cause that insider-trading violations have occurred.The Postreport was based on anonymous sources, which we cannot independently confirm or refute. However, we\u2019ve seen nothing that refutes the Post\u2019s key findings. And Bachus himself released a statement on the matter.\"I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight,\" Bachus said in a statement. \"I respect the congressional ethics process. I have fully abided by the rules governing members of Congress and look forward to the full exoneration this process will provide.\"Among the examples cited in the Post article: On Sept. 18, 2008, Bachus participated in a closed-door briefing with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. Paulson wrote in a book that they discussed the high likelihood of decline across the entire economy if drastic steps weren\u2019t taken, but Bachus denied that he received any insider information. The next day Bachus made trades that earned him profits.\"The Office of Congressional Ethics has requested information and I welcome this opportunity to present the facts and set the record straight,\" Bachus said in a statement quoted in the Post report. Bachus\u2019 spokesman did not respond to PolitiFact Florida.Facing a primary challenge on March 13 (which Bachus won), Bachus defended himself in an ad in which he blamed \"liberal Washington reporters\" and \"Obama\u2019s Democratic allies\" and claimed that \"news reports are clear. The attacks are false.\" The ad shows a headline from The Hill which quoted a former federal judge and SEC head, tapped by Bachus to review the allegations, as saying that he is innocent. Two former SEC chairman also said in a guest editorial that the allegations are \"laughable.\"\"If Mr. Bachus attended a meeting in which the troubled state of the economy (and how to deal with it) was discussed, that hardly was a state secret at the time of the meeting. Moreover, immediately after the meeting, the organizers disclosed what had been discussed,\" stated the editorial.So Bachus\u2019 PAC gave money to Rivera\u2019s campaign in May 2010 for a race he won that year, and nearly three years later the Washington Post reported that Bachus was under investigation.Our rulingGarcia said that \"Rivera has received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading.\" Technically, the donation came from Bachus\u2019 PAC and not Bachus as an individual, but that isn\u2019t a key difference in this case. More significantly, the donation was made in 2010, years before news broke about the recent investigation. We should also note that although Bachus has acknowledged providing information to the ethics office, their findings have not been made public. Obviously, we don\u2019t know what its findings will be. But in a literal sense, Garcia\u2019s claim about the donation is accurate. But it omits the additional information that the donation was made before Bachus was under investigation. We rate this claim Mostly True.",

Choose your plan ArrowRight \u2014 Former president Donald Trump, in an interview with Just the News, March 29 \u201cThe FBI knew of the laptop, knew that Hunter received a $3.5 million wire transfer from the former mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), interview on Fox News\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d April 3 Less than 50 days before the 2020 presidential election, the Republican staff of the Senate Finance and Homeland Security committees issued a joint report with a startling claim \u2014 that Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter had received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, a Russian billionaire and the widow of the former mayor of Moscow. Advertisement Trump quickly weaponized the factoid, mentioning it 42 times in the final weeks of the campaign. He sharply questioned Biden during the first presidential debate: \u201cThey were the ones involved with Russia, turns out not me, it was the opposite. But why did your son get three and a half million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow?\u201d An attorney for Hunter Biden denied the allegation in 2020 but it has lived on, especially in the right-wing media. Recently Trump called on Putin to reveal what he knows about it. Trump\u2019s call-out to Putin inspired us to dig deep into this story again. We interviewed people familiar with the transactions, reviewed property and real estate documents and probed for leads in the emails contained on a hard drive copy of the laptop Hunter Biden supposedly left behind for repair in a Delaware shop in April 2019. None of our sources would speak on the record because of continuing investigations of Hunter Biden and his business practices, but we sought confirmation from corporate filings and other records. Advertisement The flimsiness of the allegation was apparent from the start merely by carefully reading the Senate GOP report itself. The executive summary offers a seemingly definitive bullet point almost exactly the same as Johnson\u2019s comment: \u201cHunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.\u201d But the two pages in the report that deal with this transaction are considerably more nuanced, never saying outright that Hunter Biden received this money and making no claim that any laws were broken. The GOP report itself does not provide evidence to back up the claim that became a talking point \u2014 and our reporting has unearthed the best explanation about what really happened. It\u2019s a complicated story, involving a web of corporate entities, that eventually leads to the purchase of millions of dollars worth of real estate in Brooklyn by the Russian billionaire. We found no evidence that Hunter Biden was part of those transactions. A deal in China Let\u2019s start our story in China, where Hunter Biden invested in a private investment fund backed by Chinese state entities at a time when his father was vice president \u2014 a controversial practice that has raised ethical questions. The allegation that he received this payment hinges on his involvement with a firm called Rosemont Seneca Thornton that initially invested in the fund, generally known as BHR Partners. Advertisement The report says that on Feb. 14, 2014, Baturina wired $3.5 million to Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC, which it said was \u201cco-founded\u201d by Hunter Biden. The payment was listed as \u201cConsultancy Agreement DD12.02.2014,\u201d the report said. The report attributes details on financial transactions to a \u201cconfidential document\u201d obtained from the Treasury Department. Johnson and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in 2019 had announced they had sought Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on individuals and entities, including Hunter Biden. SARs are akin to an informant\u2019s tips, not evidence of fraud. Rosemont Seneca Thornton was created on May 28, 2013 according to corporation records, and was incorporated in Delaware, which does not require shareholders or directors to be revealed. But Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partner, sometimes used \u201cRosemont\u201d in company names and Biden used \u201cSeneca.\u201d Thornton referred to Thornton Group, run by Jim Bulger, who brought expertise in investing in China. Advertisement But almost as immediately as Rosemont Seneca Thornton was created, the partners decided to dissolve it, according to a person with access to the board minutes. The original structure had added unexpected regulatory burdens to Thornton, and so Bulger\u2019s lawyers advised that the group split up, this person said. Within a year, Chinese corporate records reflected that the foreign investors in BHR were Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, with 20 percent, and Thornton Group LLC, with 10 percent. Corporate records show Rosemont Seneca Bohai, the replacement corporate vehicle, was formed on Feb. 13, 2014, the day before the Baturina transfer. In theory, for Hunter Biden, Rosemont Seneca Thornton was no more. RST unexpectedly lives on But Rosemont Seneca Thornton was not dissolved as planned. Four people familiar with the company said that Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partner, controls it. Archer had kept the vehicle alive for his own real estate business, Rosemont Realty, which raised money from Eastern European and Central Asian investors, two people knowledgeable about his activities said. But he did not inform either Hunter Biden or Bulger, they said. Advertisement Archer\u2019s secret was exposed when the Senate report was published. Confronted, Archer told Bulger that he had used Rosemont Seneca Thornton to transfer funds from Baturina to purchase real estate in Brooklyn, according to a participant in the conversation. Archer and his attorney, Matthew Schwartz, did not respond to queries. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, Chris Clark, declined to comment. Baturina did not respond to emailed questions. When the report was released, she told the Daily Mail she was \u201cnot interested\u201d in explaining an alleged consultancy fee. Her estranged brother Viktor Baturin claimed to the news organization that \u201cit was a payment to enter the American market.\u201d Baturin, who is reported to be in custody after losing a fraud case filed by his sister, could not be reached for comment. Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop does not contain significant evidence of direct interaction between Hunter Biden and Baturina, according to a review of emails that have been verified by experts working with The Washington Post as well as emails that the experts were unable to verify. Her name, for instance, appears as a possible guest for a 2015 dinner that then-Vice President Biden later briefly visited, according to our reporting, but it\u2019s unclear if she attended. Advertisement There\u2019s also no sign of a $3.5 million payment in Hunter Biden\u2019s reported income for 2014, the year of the wire transfer. That year, he reported earning almost $1.25 million, according to information contained in a verified laptop email he sent to his lawyer. The email said $400,000 of the income was related to Biden\u2019s board seat at Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. Archer did a lot of business with Hunter Biden and had originally brought him into the BHR deal. But Archer also had many side deals in that period unconnected to his business with Biden. So doing his own deal with Baturina would appear to be part of that pattern. In February, Archer was sentenced to a year and a day in prison after being convicted of defrauding Native American tribes and various clients in relation to the fraudulent issuance and sale of tribal bonds between 2014 and 2016. \u201cI was doing too many things at once and not paying enough attention,\u201d said Archer before he was sentenced. \u201cI have deep remorse for the victims of the crime.\u201d Baturina\u2019s deals in Brooklyn Besides the allegation about Hunter Biden, the GOP report made other claims about payments from Baturina to Rosemont Seneca Thornton. But that part of the report showed sloppiness in the reporting and calls into question the thoroughness of the investigation. The report critically misidentified the recipient, mixing up two entities with virtually the same names. Advertisement The Fact Checker identified the correct owner of the entity that received the funds \u2014 and traced the money to real estate purchases in Brooklyn that match a statement by Baturina as well as Archer\u2019s admission that he used Rosemont Seneca Thornton to transfer funds for Baturina for real estate investments in Brooklyn. The Senate report said that \u201cbetween May 6, 2015 and Dec. 8, 2015, Baturina sent 11 wires in the amount of $391,968.21 to a bank account belonging to BAK USA LLC,\u201d with the transactions listed as \u201cloan agreement.\u201d The report said that nine of the transactions, totaling $241,797.14, were sent to a Rosemont Seneca Thornton bank account, which then transferred the money to BAK USA. The report said \u201cBAK USA was a start-up technology company headquartered in Buffalo, N.Y., that produced tablet computers in cooperation with unnamed Chinese business partners.\u201d It turns out there were two BAK USA LLCs, but the one that received the payments had a comma in its name \u2014 BAK USA, LLC, which corporate records show was formed on May 28, 2014. Advertisement In 2016, Baturina issued a statement saying she had opened a representative office in New York to oversee investments in the United States. \u201cBaturina\u2019s company has acquired the first set of commercial buildings next to Barclay\u2019s Centre, a very popular sports and entertainment venue. The company owns the buildings with a total area of 1,500 square meters, and the investment that went into their acquisition totaled US $10 million,\u201d the statement said. New York City real estate records show that BAK USA, LLC, using the same business address as Archer\u2019s firm Rosemont Capital, on June 27, 2014 had purchased two parcels in Brooklyn within a half mile of Barclays Center. One parcel was bought for $4.1 million and another for $5.4 million, or a total of $9.6 million. The properties had been auctioned by the unclaimed and seized assets program of the United States government. The property records and a property tax bill directed us to Helen Gotman, who is active in New York City real estate. She confirmed to the Fact Checker she managed the properties on behalf of Baturina. In 2018, the properties were sold for about $11.7 million each, property records show, for a gain of more than $14 million. J.P. Folsgaard Bak, a Danish lawyer who moved to the United States to become an entrepreneur, headed the Buffalo company misidentified in the report. The company had closed its doors in 2018 after Trump\u2019s Chinese tariffs made Chinese components more expensive and the tablets unprofitable. Bak said he was reading the Daily Mail in 2020, shortly after the Senate report was released, and was stunned to see an article saying his company had received payments from a Russian billionaire. The committee staff had not contacted the company before publication of the report. Bak said the story exploded on social media and threats were being made against him and his wife. He sought an immediate correction from the committee but said the company\u2019s appeals were not heeded, with officials being told the burden of proof was on the company. After the election, on Nov. 18, 2020, the committee issued a supplemental report that on Page 16 included a footnote stating: \u201cIt appears that the tablet company did not receive the wires, but rather the other entity under the name BAK USA LLC was the recipient of those funds.\u201d Bak said he did not learn of the footnote until May of the following year, when he received a letter from the Grassley\u2019s chief of staff alerting him to it. The GOP response Alexa Henning, a Johnson spokesperson, said he stood by the report. \u201cOur report cited information from factual statements in U.S. government records,\u201d said Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee Republicans, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been provided no evidence to change our findings or dissociate Hunter Biden\u2019s financial connections to Devon Archer and Yelena Baturina.\u201d In an apparent reference to the Biden laptop, he added: \u201cIn fact, additional evidence has come to light that suggests Hunter Biden and Devon Archer collaborated on financial transactions with Yelena Baturina around the time of the transaction in question, and were involved in additional financial ventures together than had been previously known.\u201d More than 10 months after leaving office, former president Donald Trump maintains a powerful hold over the Republican Party. (Video: Zach Purser Brown/The Washington Post) As for BAK USA, Foy said, \u201cHunter Biden, Devon Archer and their associates would routinely set up multiple corporations with similar names for limited use.\u201d He said that \u201cthe committee received angry messages\u201d from \u201ccombative\u201d BAK company officials but sought to clarify the record with the footnote in the supplemental report. Bak said as far as he knows, no news organization ever corrected its reporting on BAK USA. \u201cOur old company officially is still identified as the receiver of the funds, if you look it up at the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cTypical Washington strategy: October surprise on front page and subtraction at Page 11 next to the crossword.\u201d Send us facts to check by filling out this form Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter The Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles GiftOutline Gift Article",

Choose your plan ArrowRight \u201cI think the last poll I saw on this issue, on sanctuary cities, was somewhere in the 80 percent that American people don\u2019t support sanctuary cities, they don\u2019t want their tax dollars used to finance people who are in this country illegally.\u201d \u2014 White House press secretary Sean Spicer, news briefing, March 14 On March 20, the Department of Homeland Security began publishing a weekly report of noncitizens released from local custody after facing criminal charges. The reports are required under President Trump\u2019s executive order cracking down on cities, counties and states that adopted such \u201csanctuary\u201d policies. Advertisement Opponents of sanctuary jurisdictions say local and state officials should turn such individuals over to federal immigration officials to figure out whether they should be deported, and cite a poll to say that 80 percent of Americans don\u2019t support sanctuary cities. That seemed quite high, so we looked into this figure. The Facts What are sanctuary policies? There\u2019s no official definition of \u201csanctuary.\u201d It generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and state and local law enforcement can decide how much they want to cooperate with the federal government for immigration enforcement. (For more, check out our explainer and this graphic.) Sanctuary jurisdictions release noncitizen inmates after their criminal case is complete (i.e., they served their time, their charges were dropped or they secured bail). The inmate may or may not be illegally present in the United States. Advertisement Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can issue an \u201cimmigration detainer,\u201d which is a request to be notified when a noncitizen is being released at state or local levels. It\u2019s voluntary for these agencies to comply with an ICE detainer. If they comply, they hold noncitizens for up to 48 hours beyond the time they otherwise would have been released. ICE can take custody and figure out whether the inmate should be deported. If ICE doesn\u2019t take action during that 48-hour window, the local or state agency is required to release them. Agencies in sanctuary jurisdictions decline ICE detainers, whether out of fear it might silence victims or potential witnesses, or because they don\u2019t have enough resources to cooperate. The new weekly DHS report is a list of declined detainers. Still, some sanctuary jurisdictions cooperate with the federal government if they believe the inmate is a public safety threat. Advertisement The \u201980 percent\u2019 figure This widely cited figure comes from a February 2017 national poll of 2,148 registered voters by Harvard University\u2019s Center for American Political Studies and the Harris Poll. The poll uses an opt-in Web panel sample, which we often warn readers against relying on unless the poll has shown reasonable accuracy in pre-election polls over the years. Harris did not produce final pre-election surveys in 2012 or 2016. The poll\u2019s question about sanctuary cities reads: \u201cShould cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes be required to turn them over to immigration authorities?\u201d Eighty percent of people responded \u201cyes.\u201d The researchers said it was referring to whether cities should comply with immigration detainers, and did not suggest that undocumented immigrants arrested for crimes should automatically be deported, or that federal funding should be cut off. As we described above, cities have to release inmates if ICE doesn\u2019t take custody after 48 hours. Advertisement Notably, this question asks about \u201ccrimes.\u201d Criminality is a key factor in the public\u2019s attitude toward immigration, and support for deporting people who commit crimes \u2014 especially violent crimes \u2014 is high. (For more, read our fact-check on sanctuary cities and crime.) The use of the word \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201carrests\u201d could bring to mind violent crimes, our friends at PolitiFact noted. But not all these arrests are of noncitizens suspected of violent crimes, or even convicted of any crimes. And some cities still cooperate with federal authorities to prosecute or identify violent criminals. What do other polls show? There\u2019s not a lot of research on public opinion of sanctuary cities. But two reliable polls have found mixed public opinion in response to more nuanced questions about sanctuary cities, or when specifically asked about pulling federal funding from sanctuary cities (which the administration wants to do). Advertisement A February McClatchy-Marist poll of U.S. adults asked two questions about sanctuary policies: \u201d \u2018Sanctuary City\u2019 is a term used to describe U.S. cities which do not enforce immigration laws and allow undocumented immigrants to live there and, in many cases, receive services. Which comes closer to your opinion? Undocumented immigrants should be deported so there is no reason to have sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cities are needed to provide services to undocumented immigrants while they are in this country.\u201d Response: 41 percent believed there was no reason to have them, and 50 percent believed they are needed. \u201cDo you support or oppose the federal government cutting funds to cities that provide sanctuary for undocumented immigrants?\u201d Response: 42 percent supported, 53 percent opposed. A Fox News poll this month of registered voters asked: \u201cSome so-called \u2018sanctuary\u2019 cities refuse to assist federal authorities detain and deport illegal immigrants \u2014 do you favor or oppose penalizing those cities by taking away their federal funding?\u201d Response: 41 percent supported and 53 percent opposed taking away federal funds from sanctuary cities. Advertisement (A huge thank you to Washington Post\u2019s polling manager Scott Clement for vetting and interpreting the polls.) The Bottom Line There\u2019s no perfect polling question, and we recognize sanctuary policies and immigration detainers are not easily distilled into one question. It\u2019s clear that public opinion on sanctuary policies varies based on how you ask the question, and what exactly you ask about such policies.

        "doc": "CLAIM Canadian data shows vaccinated people more likely to die from COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccines alter our DNA; hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin cure COVID-19 more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Charlie Kirk, The Charlie Kirk Show, 17 Jul. 2022 DETAILS Factually inaccurate: COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t alter people\u2019s DNA. Misrepresents a complex reality: The age-standardized rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths don\u2019t account for important differences in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, such as a higher proportion of people with underlying health conditions among vaccinated people. Therefore, such rates don't necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness. Unsupported: Studies so far have shown that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are ineffective at treating or preventing COVID-19. KEY TAKE AWAY Studies show that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t alter people\u2019s DNA. No reliable scientific evidence shows that hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin cure COVID-19. FULL CLAIM: \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID\u201d; \u201cWhy aren't they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d; \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d REVIEW On 17 July 2022, political activist Charlie Kirk published a video on Facebook, claiming that Canadian data showed COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of death from COVID-19. The video was viewed more than 720,000 times and shared more than 21,000 times. Kirk also rehashed old, inaccurate, and misleading claims that COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin cure COVID-19, which have already been debunked by fact-checkers before, as we will show below. Claim 1 (Incorrect): \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID.\u201d Kirk cited an article by journalist Alex Berenson to support this claim. Berenson, who made multiple inaccurate and misleading claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, claimed in a Substack article that data from the Manitoban government showed that, vaccinated people \u201cwere about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die of Covid than unvaccinated people\u201d in May 2022. Below is the graph referenced by Berenson. The age-standardized rate of hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths associated with COVID-19 in Manitoba for April (top) and May (bottom) 2022. Note how the trends in April contrast with those in May. While the data presented here accounted for differences in risk due to age\u2014which is important because severe COVID-19 is associated with advanced age\u2014 the difference in the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and the amount of time a person spent in each vaccination status, there are other important factors that remain unaccounted for. For example, people with preexisting health conditions that increase their risk of severe COVID-19 are more likely to be overrepresented among vaccinated people. This, along with differences in infection levels, different variants, and differing levels in immunity from prior infection, mean that age-standardized rates don\u2019t necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness, as the UK Office of National Statistics cautioned: \u201cThe [age-standardized mortality rates] give the age-adjusted risk of death for the people in the different vaccination status groups. Estimating vaccine effectiveness is challenging when vaccination status is not allocated at random, as factors that vary between the vaccination status groups and over time need to be accounted for to determine the causal impact of vaccines on mortality.\u201d Furthermore, the data showed a different trend in April 2022, just a month before the one that Berenson used, indicating a lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths in both the vaccinated and the people who received a booster dose. Therefore, Berenson may have cherry-picked data that supported the narrative he wished to present and left out data that conflicted with his narrative. If the COVID-19 vaccines contributed to the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, as Berenson and Kirk claimed, we would expect to see the same or even more pronounced trend in people who received a booster dose (the blue bar in the graph), since these people received the most doses among the three groups. However, the rate of death in people who received a booster dose is the same as in unvaccinated people, not higher. Berenson himself was aware of this, as he wrote: \u201cPeople who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated\u201d. Nevertheless, he went on to claim that the \u201cdata show vaccines now RAISE the risk of death from Covid\u201d, which is demonstrably false. Data for the whole of Canada\u2014which provides a larger sample size than just Manitoba alone\u2014also contradict Berenson\u2019s claim. Health Canada reported that from 9 May to 5 June 2022, \u201cunvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series. During the same 4-week period, unvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 6 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series and 1 or more additional doses\u201d. Large-scale studies support this observation, finding that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and death. Indeed, a modeling study published in The Lancet Infectious Disease estimated that COVID-19 vaccination saved tens of millions of lives globally[1]. While the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has dampened vaccine effectiveness against disease[2,3], getting vaccinated remains safer than not getting vaccinated. Claim 2 (Misrepresents source): \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d As evidence for this claim, Kirk highlighted a Fox News segment from 12 July 2022, in which Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor, said: \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s clear from the data [is] that even though vaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well, as it were, against infection, they protect quite well against severe disease leading to hospitalization and death.\u201d However, Kirk only presented the part where Fauci said that \u201cvaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well\u201d, leaving out the rest in which he clarified that COVID-19 vaccines are still effective at keeping people from becoming seriously ill and dying. By doing so, Kirk distorted the meaning of Fauci\u2019s words. Claim 3 (Factually inaccurate): COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d This old claim is false and has been refuted many times. As explained in numerous fact-checks, the COVID-19 vaccines cannot alter our DNA. The mRNA used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are unable to directly integrate into our DNA, because RNA is chemically different from DNA. Nevertheless, some continued to propagate this false claim through various means, such as by citing an inaccurate Forbes article headline or a study by Lund University, which allegedly showed that RNA from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reverse-transcribed, or converted into DNA, and entered the cells. The study set out to determine if mRNA from the vaccine was reverse-transcribed and if so, whether the resulting DNA entered the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is stored. The experiments were conducted in human liver cells originating from a hepatocarcinoma (liver cancer). As this Health Feedback review explained, the experiments didn\u2019t show that vaccine mRNA was reverse-transcribed or that foreign DNA entered the nucleus of the cells, much less integrate into cell DNA. Claim 4 (Unsupported): \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin were touted by some as preventative and curative medicine for COVID-19. However, there is no reliable scientific evidence to support this claim. As we reported in previous Health Feedback reviews, large-scale randomized controlled trials, including those conducted by the University of Oxford and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, didn\u2019t find any of these drugs to be effective at reducing the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19[4-7].

Grab drivers scrambling over orders, barely any seats available.\u201d MK is a popular restaurant chain in Thailand, specialising in Chinese Suki cuisine. The restaurant chain was hit by a boycott in March 2021, fuelled by anti-government Twitter users who accused the popular restaurant chain of sponsoring a pro-government news outlet, according to a report on local news website Thai Enquirer. Thai opposition MP Amarat Chokepamitkul from the Move Forward Party said in a Facebook post on March 22, 2021 that she would \u201cstop eating at MK... until sponsorship for Top News channel ends\u201d. MK has not spoken publicly to confirm or deny the sponsorship. The same image has been shared alongside similar claims in March 2021 on Facebook here, here and here. However, the claim is false. The photo was in fact taken in March 2020. A Google reverse image search found the same image published here in an article on 28 March, 2020 by Thai economics magazine Sentangsedtee.

        "doc": "\u201cGreeting staff at @TeamTrump HQ this morning, a reminder that the media doesn\u2019t select the President,\u201d Tim Murtaugh tweeted on November 8, 2020. Two photos were attached to the tweet. One showed an image of a front page of The Washington Times that read: \u201cPRESIDENT GORE,\u201d followed by: \u201cFlorida pushes Gore over the top with bare majority.\u201d The second showed dozens of copies of the image on the walls of the Trump campaign headquarters. The tweet was later deleted, but screenshots of the photo of the front page remained and were shared on other social media platforms, including on Facebook. However, the image is a doctored version of a real front page by The Washington Times, a newspaper based in the US capital. \u201cThese photos have been doctored,\u201d the conservative-leaning newspaper replied to Murtaugh on Twitter. \u201cThe Washington Times never ran a \u2018President Gore\u2019 headline.\u201d The doctored photo was based on a November 8, 2000 copy of The Washington Times. The original copy that was falsified read: \u201cPRESIDENT BUSH,\u201d followed by: \u201cFlorida pushes Texan over the top with bare majority,\u201d according to a photo by a Twitter user who said they had a physical copy. However, other printed versions of the November 8, 2000 Washington Times edition featured the headlines \u201cNo President Yet,\u201d and \u201cDown to the Wire.\u201d The falsified headline tweeted by Murtaugh was based on the \u201cPRESIDENT BUSH\u201d version, as it is the only one that reports 207 seats for House Republicans, and 189 for House Democrats. While the headline was doctored in the image tweeted by Murtaugh, other text on the front page was not, CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski pointed out on Twitter. One article read: \u201cGeorge W. Bush, the son of the president who was vanquished by the Clinton-Gore team eight years ago, avenged his father early this morning by defeating Al Gore, creating only the second father-son presidential dynasty in history.\u201d On the night of November 7, 2000, news organizations including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and the Associated Press predicted Democrat Al Gore had won the race. But Bush\u2019s victory was eventually called by most media on November 8. An agonizingly long recount in the key battleground state of Florida was eventually halted by the US Supreme Court weeks later, definitively giving the presidency to Republican Bush.",

        "doc": "A post with the following description is being shared on social media \u2013 \u20185-year-old was raped in Dubai\u2026Within 15 minutes of this rape incident, the judiciary ordered the police to shoot the rapist in public view\u2018. The post is accompanied by a video in which a man is executed, and his dead body is later hanged in public. Let\u2019s verify these claims via this article. Claim: The judiciary of Dubai has ordered that a rapist be executed within 15 minutes of the incident. The video in the post shows the execution of the rapist. Fact: The video belongs to an execution of a Yemeni man that occurred in 2017. Reportedly, he was executed on the charges of raping and killing a 5-year-old girl. Since a video from Yemen is being falsely shared as if it is from Dubai, and the trial took more than two years, the post is MISLEADING. After performing a reverse image search on Yandex with the screenshots of the posted video, we were led to a 2017 news report by \u2018The Sun\u2019. Its title reads \u2013 \u2018Sick paedo who raped and killed a four-year-old girl is shot dead and HUNG from a crane in chilling public execution in Yemen.\u2019 The images in the report show the rape convict lying facedown on a red cloth, a policeman firing a gun from behind, and his corpse hanging from a crane which matches the visuals from the video. Reportedly, a man named Hussein Abdullah Al-Saket abducted a five-year-old girl on 09 November 2015, raped, murdered, and buried the lifeless body in a deserted area. He was publicly executed on 14 August 2017 at Tahrir Square in Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa. Other reports on this incident can be read here, here, and here. With all this evidence, we can conclude that an old video from 2017 of an incident from Yemen is being falsely shared as from Dubai executing a man within 15 minutes of rape. To sum it up, an old execution video of a rape accused in Yemen is shared as an incident in Dubai, and the trial took more than two years and not 15 minutes.",

        "claim": "\"In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs.\"",
        "doc": "Addressing supporters in an airport hangar in Addison, Perry said that on his watch, companies in Texas created almost one third of all new American jobs. And, he said, \"in the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs.\" Sounded familiar. In May 2013, we found True a Perry claim about Texas accounting for 33 percent of the country\u2019s net new jobs over the last 10 years. That conclusion was supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. Later, in January 2015, we rated Mostly True Perry\u2019s statement that starting in December 2007, \"1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.\" His figures mostly held up according to household surveys by the federal government looking into civilian employment including self-employment, though at the time positions not yet recovered outside Texas totaled closer to 350,000, according to the latest available data when Perry spoke to lawmakers Jan. 22, 2015. When we looked at the earlier Texas-nation comparison by Perry, his spokesman encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint. Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. \"In contrast,\" he wrote, \"civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level \u2026 there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007.\" To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls \"total employment,\" covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates. A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparisons, \"comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included.\" In contrast, the federal government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers \"covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments.\" By this other metric, Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the bureau, told us, Texas netted 1.2 million additional jobs from December 2007 to December 2014. In the period, she said, 24 states had net decreases in total civilian employment. But again, those figures weren\u2019t total employment, the indicator chosen by Perry. After Perry declared for president, we circled back to Abbot, who emailed us data indicating that from December 2007 to December 2014, Texas saw an increase in total employment of 1,572,694; the nation as a whole had a surge of 1,169,000. Put another way, but for Texas, the nation would have experienced a total employment decrease of 403,694. When we looked into Perry\u2019s seven-year contrast before, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute commented that the timeframe singled out by Perry may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government\u2019s payroll surveys, he said, the country had added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. had added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them. At the time, Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: \"Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did,\" he emailed. \"Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won\u2019t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that\u2019s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains,\" he wrote. Also at the time, Abbot said by email Perry\u2019s claim could have been precise by referring to \"total civilian employment\" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. \"On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763,\" Abbot wrote. Our ruling Perry said: \"In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs.\" These figures hold up though Perry cherry-picked a time period arguably giving Texas more of a gloss than it might get with other periods. More generally, no governor determines job gains or losses in a state; outside factors tend to prevail. In Texas, the fracking boom comes to mind. Governors don\u2019t create oil and gas fields. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. CORRECTION, 12:40 p.m., June 18, 2015: This fact check was revised to correct our error in quoting an email from Cheryl Abbot of the BLS. This change, clarifying that 24 states had net decreases in civilian employment in the period singled out by Perry, did not affect our rating.",

The above tweet has been posted with the words \u201c\u0928\u0902\u0926\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 \u091a\u094c\u0939\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093f\u0917\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u092c\u094b\u0932 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0905\u092a\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0924\u201d (Nandkumar Chauhan once again insults women- translation). The video has gone viral on Facebook where several individual users have uploaded it on their timelines, with an altered message. Clipped video The video clip in question is edited. In fact, Nandkumar Chauhan was referring to Congress President Rahul Gandhi. According to the complete sound bite, Chauhan was saying that it was Rahul Gandhi who had made this ridiculous remark at a rally. The video posted below shows the complete exchange between Chauhan and the reporters around him. The translation of the same is posted below: Chauhan: What Congress says, can be seen in the video of Rahul Gandhi which has gone viral today Reporters: What kind of video? What is your reaction to this video? Chauhan: People are reacting. Today, he (Rahul Gandhi) in the video said that there are women in UP who give birth every week, who give 52 babies in a year. (translated from Hindi). Chauhan had referred to clipped video of Rahul Gandhi Interestingly, Nandkumar Chauhan himself had fallen prey to misinformation. He was referring to a clipped video of Rahul Gandhi which was being circulated widely, and had been fact-checked by Alt News. The video in question is of an address by Rahul Gandhi in Phoolpur, UP in November 2011. In the complete video, Gandhi can be heard speaking in the context of the Janani Suraksha Yojana under National Rural Health Mission, in which pregnant women get an incentive of Rs 1400 for institutional delivery. In that context, Gandhi had claimed that according to a RTI response, there was massive corruption in this scheme, and that women with the same name were getting the incentive every week. The same is posted below. The relevant portion begins from 5:25 minutes. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s exact words were, \u201cHumne RTI manga, RTI mein jo hamein report mili, UP mein aisi mahilae hai, jo har saptah ek bacha paida kar sakti hai, aisi mahilae hai jo saal mein 52 bachha de rahi hai, ek hi naam hai, 1400 rupay har saptah uske jeb mein, aur ek hi ek mahila nahin hai, hazaro mahilae hai\u201d. Translation: We filed an RTI, according to the RTI response, UP has such women who are giving birth to a child every week, there are such women who are giving birth to 52 children per year, all have one name, 1400 rupees in their pocket every week, and there are thousands of such women. From his speech, the part where he says, \u201cUP mein aisi mahilae hai ho har saptah ek bachcha paida kar sakti hai, aisi mahilae hai jo saal mein 52 bachhe de rahi hai (UP has such women who are giving birth to a child every week, there are such women who are giving birth to 52 children per year)\u201c, was clipped and circulated thus leading to a false impression. The tweet by Modi supporter Renuka Jain, posted below is an instance. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 Mega Breaking News : UP \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0910\u0938\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u090f\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0939\u0930 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0939 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e \u092a\u0948\u0926\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 52 \u092c\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0926\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u2013 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940 pic.twitter.com/ylJTyIEzDs \u2014 #RenukaJain Chowkidar \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@RenukaJain6) April 24, 2019 In conclusion, it is ironical that the former MP BJP president became a victim of the same misinformation, while mocking Rahul Gandhi and attributing a false statement on the basis of an edited video clip.

        "claim": "\"As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we\u2019ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars through the reduction of the standing committees.\"",
        "doc": "Republicans, who control the Ohio House, called a news conference April 12 to pat themselves on the back for the work they had done the first 100 days of their two year stretch in the 129th General Assembly.The group, led by Speaker William G. Batchelder, is quite proud of some of its early accomplishments.A particular claim that state Rep. Cheryl Grossman, a Republican from Grove City near Columbus, made when it was her turn at the podium resonated most with Politifact Ohio.\"As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we\u2019ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars ($250,000) through the reduction of the standing committees.\" said Grossman, a former Grove City mayor.At a time when Ohio\u2019s economy is still struggling to recover from a devastating national recession in recent years which helped blow an $8 billion deficit in the state\u2019s budget, any amount of savings is a good thing. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Grossman\u2019s figures.We called the House Republican caucus (basically, Batchelder\u2019s office) for an explanation and information to back up Grossman\u2019s comments. The caucus said it verified its numbers through the House clerk\u2019s office, which is considered independent but is run by a Republican appointed by Batchelder. (The speaker always gets to appoint the clerk and usually it is someone from the same political party.)To start with, Batchelder eliminated 10 standing committees that existed during the 128th General Assembly under House Speaker Armond Budish, a Democrat. That dropped the number of standing committees from 27 to 17.Above their standard annual pay, stipends are paid to leaders of the each committee: $6,500 for the chairman and $5,000 each to the vice-chairman and ranking minority member for a total of $16,500 in extra pay each year per committee.Multiply that by 10, the number of committees eliminated, and you come away with $165,000 in annual savings. Grossman didn\u2019t say it, but can we give her the benefit of the doubt? She meant in each year of the biennium considering lawmakers salaries are paid on an annual schedule.So, that $165,000 over two years becomes $330,000 in savings, and that is not including the additional cost for benefits for lawmakers who receive the stipends.But Batchelder did add three new standing sub-committees that did not exist under Budish in the previous two years. The sub-committee chair gets $5,000 and ranking minority member $2,500 (there is no vice chairman for these committees) totaling $7,500 per subcommittee. By adding three sub-committees Batchelder created a new line of expense totaling $22,000 a year in extra pay for lawmakers, not including benefits.Subtract that from the savings generated from the elimination of sub-committees and House Republicans still save the state about $286,000.But hold on.While state representatives can serve in a leadership role on more than one committee they can only be paid one stipend. There were seven Democrats who pulled double duty under Budish, meaning they served as a chair or vice chair on more than one committee, but they were only paid one stipend, says House minority caucus spokesman Keary McCarthy.Michael Dittoe, a spokesman for House majority caucus, provided the math in an e-mail. The savings on stipend payments, when the unused stipends are removed, amounts to $217,000, he said. Adding in savings from retirement costs and administrative costs that aren't incurred raises that about 17 percent to just under $254,000. So it seems Grossman was right on the money as far as the dollars and cents in her claim. But wait, there\u2019s more.Grossman says the House Republicans are \"saving\" the state money. That\u2019s an attractive claim in the middle of budget season. Gov. John Kasich last month proposed a $55 billion, two year spending proposal that closes the deficit. The House is currently reviewing the proposal.According to an analysis of the House of Representatives budget proposal, Batchelder\u2019s leadership team is requesting the same appropriation in each of the next two years as the House is spending in the current year, just shy of $20 million per year.\"I\u2019m not sure how one can claim savings when they are spending the exact same amount,\" said the Democrats McCarthy.Politifact Ohio followed up with Dittoe. Preparing the House budget request involved use of cost projections made prior to the new General Assembly being sworn into office. Those projections anticipate increased costs, particularly for health care benefits, that prompted the House to recommend a spending plan that could cover some \"worst case scenarios,\" he said in an e-mail. He notes, though, that while the projections suggest healthcare costs could rise nearly $500,000 for just the members of the General Assembly, the requested budget was flat. The hope is that cuts elsewhere will cover those increases, if they come to pass. And, he added, that the exact funding level for the House won't be known until the budget is passed. So where does that leave us? There is an element of truth in Grossman\u2019s claim: there are 10 fewer standing committees and the amount paid for leadership stipends will be less.But the bigger point she made that day while standing before a throng of media, including television cameras, was that Republicans are saving Ohio $250,000.Where\u2019s the savings?Republicans may have cut spending in one area -- committee costs -- but the budget request for House operations is at the same level, which means that money was redirected to be spent elsewhere. And Dittoe cited one area in particular - health costs. That\u2019s a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression of Grossman\u2019s claim -- that characterizing the committee changes as a savings to the state of Ohio is misleading.On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Grossman\u2019s statement as Barely True.",

        "claim": "Says under Mitt Romney, \"Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan.\"",
        "doc": "CORRECTION: We first published this item on May 22, 2012, with a rating of False. But readers pointed out we had incorrectly said that the Wyden-Ryan and Romney plans for Medicare offered traditional fee-for-service Medicare alongside a premium-support or \"voucher\" system for purchasing private insurance. Instead, both plans offer traditional Medicare inside of a new premium-support system, as another plan that competes with private insurance. We corrected and updated our item, this time including the complete sentence from the campaign website. We reconsidered our original conclusion and have now rated the statement Mostly False.\"Julia,\" a character created by the Obama campaign, would be better off under President Barack Obama because of Mitt Romney\u2019s position on Medicare, the campaign says.Its Web cartoon, \"The Life of Julia,\" compares the impact of the candidates' policies on Julia at a dozen points in her life. At age 65, here\u2019s the contrast it draws between President Barack Obama and Romney: Under President Obama: Julia enrolls in Medicare, helping her to afford preventive care and the prescription drugs she needs. Under Mitt Romney: Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan. We wondered, under Romney\u2019s policies, is it true that, \"Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan\"?Outdated analysisThe day the Julia graphic was published online, the Obama campaign released a memo explaining that the character would let voters compare the effect of Obama and Romney\u2019s policies on a typical middle-class woman at each step in her life.It provided more detail on the campaign\u2019s claim that under Romney \"Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance\" \u2014 along with a source.\"He would end Medicare as we know it by replacing seniors\u2019 guaranteed benefits with a voucher to buy insurance coverage \u2014 a plan similar to ones that the Congressional Budget Office found would raise seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket health care spending by $6,350 a year,\" the memo said.But reliance on that April 2011 CBO report is misleading for at least two reasons. It analyzes an out-of-date plan, and ignores that Romney has offered his own. We\u2019ll look at both issues in turn.Old plans, new plansFirst, we should clarify that none of these GOP proposals suggest dramatic changes to Medicare for anyone who\u2019s already 55 or older \u2014 so we\u2019re assuming a world where Julia is young enough to be affected.The ad bases its claim on a Medicare proposal from House budget chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., put forward in early 2011. The Julia cartoon gets its number of $6,350 extra per year from an analysis of that plan, which had a tighter spending cap and didn\u2019t include traditional Medicare as an option. Since then, Ryan has proposed a new Medicare plan, released in March 2012, which offers voucher-like credits for traditional fee-for-service Medicare, alongside private insurance options. (Those credits are sometimes referred to as \"premium support.\")Ryan\u2019s new plan was based on yet another plan released in December 2011 in collaboration with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon \u2014 which is the one we\u2019ll focus on here. Why? Because Romney\u2019s plan says that bipartisan plan \"almost precisely mirrors\" his.(Wyden-Ryan and the new Ryan plan are substantially similar, with a few key differences; see a side-by-side comparison by the Kaiser Family Foundation.)The Wyden-Ryan planSeniors already pay premiums for Medicare, notably the parts of Medicare that cover doctor visits and prescription drug coverage. Under Wyden-Ryan, seniors could use their premium support payments to help pay for traditional Medicare coverage. That coverage would be among the options on a new Medicare exchange, which would also include private plans that offered \"at least as comprehensive a benefit as traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\"Those plans wouldn\u2019t necessarily supply the same menu of benefits, but benefits with the same dollar value, something called \"actuarial equivalence.\" The Wyden-Ryan plan would peg the size of the payments to the second-lowest-cost plan on the exchange.Whether seniors would have to pay more for choosing traditional Medicare would depend on how fee-for-service Medicare stacked up against private plans. If it were more expensive, seniors would pay more out of pocket to keep it. If it were cheaper, they would get money back.(We should mention that lower-income beneficiaries would get more help than higher-income ones, not unlike Medicare\u2019s current medical and drug insurance coverage.)The requirement that private plans offer benefits of at least the same value as traditional Medicare offers more protection than \"nothing but a voucher\" suggests, says Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush.She supports the push for private competition under Wyden-Ryan, arguing it could introduce innovation that boosts care and saves money.But critics of the proposal, such as Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, say that the dollar-value requirement sets up a vicious cycle where plans compete to attract the lowest-risk patients, leaving a higher-risk group in traditional Medicare and driving up costs.Wyden-Ryan attempts to tackle this problem by asking plans with a lower-risk pool to pay into a fund that subsidizes those for higher-risk patients.Aaron says that such \"risk adjustment\" tools simply aren\u2019t sophisticated enough.\"When you're confronted with a vague proposal to replace a vitally important institution, and the sponsors have not nailed down key elements of that proposal, it's fair for critics to worry that some problematic things will happen,\" Aaron said.Another reason analysts fear that premium-support payments under Wyden-Ryan would leave seniors on the hook for rising health care costs is that the plan includes a spending cap if competition among private plans and traditional Medicare doesn\u2019t keep costs in check.Starting in 2022 \u2014 the same time people would start to be eligible to buy coverage from the new Medicare exchange \u2014 there would be a cap on Medicare cost growth of 1 percent over the country\u2019s gross domestic product, plus inflation. But the Wyden-Ryan plan \u2014 unlike the later Ryan plan \u2014 says the government would get savings from providers, drug companies and means-tested premiums, not necessarily by shifting costs to beneficiaries by chopping premium-support payments.That spending cap is similar to the one supported by Obama, but they have different ways to achieve it. The president would merely set the cap as a target, then primarily rely on changes to provider payments recommended by theIndependent Payment Advisory Board, which was created by the Affordable Care Act.The Romney planMeanwhile, the graphic ignores that Romney has his own Medicare plan. While Romney\u2019s proposal in its own words \"almost precisely mirrors\" the Wyden-Ryan plan, Romney\u2019s plan is even less specific. Romney doesn\u2019t specify the size of premium support payments to seniors, nor how quickly those payments will grow over time.Instead, a question-and-answer section merely says that, \"he is exploring different options for ensuring that future seniors receive the premium support they need while also ensuring that competitive pressures encourage providers to improve quality and control cost. His goal is for Medicare to offer every senior affordable options that provide coverage and service at least as good as what today\u2019s seniors receive.\" That simply doesn\u2019t support the kinds of specific claims the Obama camp makes about Romney\u2019s policy proposal.One thing Romney\u2019s plan does clearly say: \"Traditional Medicare will compete against private plans.\" Just as with the Wyden-Ryan plan, that may be via a premium-support system. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll necessarily leave Julia on the hook for extra payments as the Obama campaign\u2019s graphic suggests.Our rulingThe Obama campaign\u2019s \"Life of Julia\" graphic says that under Romney, \"Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan.\"But the bipartisan plan Romney supports includes traditional Medicare among seniors\u2019 options for purchase on a Medicare exchange. It also requires other plans to offer benefits of at least the same value. Finally, it includes a more generous cap on spending growth than the original Ryan plan. If all plans rose in cost, hitting a proposed spending cap, the bipartisan plan says the government would turn to providers and other sources of savings. Meanwhile, Romney\u2019s plan simply isn\u2019t specific enough to justify the statement, \"which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan\" \u2014 a number based on analysis of the original Ryan plan.The Obama campaign ties Romney to an outdated plan with less generous spending growth and no traditional Medicare option. Romney does support a voucher-like system, but the graphic ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about his plan. We rate the claim Mostly False.",

Fact Check BOOM first performed a keyword search for \"minority conversion national assembly Pakistan\" while looking for reports on conversations about the forced religious conversions in the parliament of Pakistan. The search led us to The Express Tribune report mentioning about a \"minority convention\" which was held for the first time in the country's parliamentary history in August 2022. The event was organised to recall Muhammad Ali Jinnah's speech on the freedom and equality of minorities in 1947. Taking a cue, we searched for posts on the official Facebook profile of National Assembly of Pakistan and found pictures of the event which was held on August 11, 2022. Click here to view the post. We then looked for the videos from the event on the Pakistani state-run broadcaster PTV News' YouTube channel PTV Parliament which covers the country's parliament proceedings. The minority convention event was streamed live on PTV Parliament's YouTube channel on August 11, 2022. We noticed that the speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf identifies the person in the viral video as Tariq Masih Gill at the 37:04 timestamp. The same speech can be heard from 40:23 minutes to 42:22 minutes time mark when compared to the viral video. According to the official website of the Pakistan's Punjab provisional assembly, Tariq Masih Gill belongs to the Christian community and a leader from the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party. Gill was elected as a member of the assembly in general elections 2013. ",

        "doc": "This post by BBC Pidgin, shared over a thousand times, and archived here, quoted a local privately-owned radio station as repoorting that an unnamed zoo official claimed the money was swallowed by a huge gorilla. The BBC, however, said in its report that it could not independently verify the claim. Many Nigerian newspapers and blogs reproduced the story, citing the BBC, Freedom Radio, or no source at all. Some of them, archived here, here, here, here and here, have been shared thousands of times on Facebook. The same post has also been shared in other countries across Africa, including South Africa, Ghana and Kenya. Some of those posts have been archived here, here, here, and here. AFP journalist Aminu Abubakar made a visit to the zoo, where he was told that the site has never had a gorilla in its care since it first opened nearly half a century ago. Umar Yusuf, general manager of the zoo, explained that the money in question was stolen at around 3am on Sunday, June 9, 2019. \u201cSuspected armed robbers stormed into the zoo and broke into the administrative section and burgled and ransacked seven offices,\u201d Yusuf told Abubakar. \u201cA safe where 6.8 million naira was ripped open and the money stolen. The money was from gate takings during the Muslim Sallah (Eid) festivities. Nine security guards on duty were tied together and locked inside an office by the robbers.\u201d He said the money had been kept in the zoo office as it was received over public holidays, when \u201cbanks didn't open\u201d. Western gorillas are considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Nura Lawn Doguwa, the head of the primate section at the zoo, said the Kano zoo kept no gorillas. It does however keep six monkey species: the sooty mangabey, the tantalus monkey, the chimpanzee, the red patas, the mona and the dog-faced baboon. The gorilla story was first aired on the privately-owned Freedom Radio on June 10 via its popular Hausa program \"Inda Ranks\", which roughly translates as \u201cOdd World\u201d. The zoo manager said a Freedom Radio reporter came to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the story a day after the radio aired the gorilla story, but the management refused to talk to him on the grounds that the police, anti-graft agency and a committee set up by the state governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje were carrying out an investigation. The reporter returned two days later but was rebuffed. The zoo management said it is considering \"appropriate legal action\" against the radio station for the \"embarrassment\" the report caused the zoo. The guards on duty when the theft occurred are still in police custody, while investigations by the police and the Kano state anti-corruption agency are ongoing. It was claimed in 2018 that a snake had swallowed N36 million ($100,000) at the office of Nigeria\u2019s Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB).

Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?\" stated a May 27 Facebook post by the New Florida Majority, a liberal group. The post included a photo of Gov. Ron DeSantis. The group got the information from a viral tweet by Kellen Squire, an ER nurse in Virginia. According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from #COVID and 5,185 from pneumonia.Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918.Probably just a coincidence, yeah? The tweet drew tens of thousands of likes and shares over the next few days and was echoed by Democratic political figures. Former party chairman Howard Dean accused Florida of \"cooking the books.\" That doesn\u2019t appear to be what happened. While some of the numbers in the post are in the ballpark, the way Squire compared them creates a misleading picture. RELATED: COVID-19 skeptics say there\u2019s an overcount. Doctors in the field say the opposite This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Squire, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, told us he drew his information from a Reddit thread showing death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The r/coronavirus thread said Florida\u2019s pneumonia deaths were in the 900 range between 2015 and 2018, but jumped above 4,000 this year. Squire ran with those numbers for his tweet, pulling in CDC estimates for Florida deaths from COVID-19 and pneumonia this year. (The data for 2019 has not yet been finalized.) But that comparison doesn\u2019t work, said Bob Anderson, the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch in the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. The issue is the way causes of death are coded in CDC data. If the death certificate mentions both COVID-19 and pneumonia, both codes are included in CDC data for the current year, and the death will be allocated to both categories in the CDC\u2019s provisional surveillance system, which keeps a rough running tally of deaths in a given year. In 2021, when the CDC finalizes the data and reports national statistics for 2020 cases, it will focus on the underlying cause of death, and assign only one cause to each death. In a case where both pneumonia and COVID-19 are reported on the death certificate, the underlying cause will almost always be COVID-19, Anderson said. In recent years, the number of Florida residents whose underlying cause of death was pneumonia was in the 900s through this point in the year. (When Anderson looked at a separate category of deaths that occurred in Florida, which includes residents and visitors, the numbers were slightly higher.) For the 5,185 figure that Squire tweeted, \"many of them actually are pneumonia due to COVID-19, or pneumonia due to other conditions such as influenza,\" Anderson said. \"But the fact is those with pneumonia due to COVID-19 would be counted in both COVID-19 and pneumonia category\" in the provisional data. So what these posts did was take the 900 figure, which referred to cases in recent years where pneumonia is the underlying cause of death, and compare that to a broader category of cases this year where pneumonia is mentioned on a death certificate, data which is provisional at this point. That said, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government'sleading infectious-disease specialist,and othermedical expertshave said the government\u2019s COVID-19 death toll is an undercount. There are several reasons why a COVID-19 death might not be reported as such, including that a test was not available or that the person died at home. \"It is likely we are underestimating the number of deaths at this point from COVID-19, but it\u2019s going to vary from state to state,\" Anderson said. A spokeswoman for the New Florida Majority, which posted the claim on Facebook, pointed to an article by The Daily Beast about undercounting of COVID deaths in Florida and elsewhere. Florida\u2019s public data reporting about COVID-19 deaths has drawn scrutiny. In May, a state Department of Health employee said she was pressured to manipulate data and was fired. A spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis said the employee had been insubordinate and the state denied any manipulation of the data. However, county medical examiners have reported higher death counts than the state. A Facebook post said, \"According to the CDC, so far this year, Florida has had 1,762 deaths from COVID-19 and 5,185 from pneumonia. Average pneumonia deaths in Florida from 2013-2018 for the same time period are 918. Probably just a coincidence, yeah?\" Each number here stems from actual data, but the post makes comparisons between them that are misleading. Pneumonia deaths in Florida are up this year compared with some recent years, but the tweet ignores that the CDC\u2019s provisional data for this year counts some deaths for now as being caused by both pneumonia and COVID-19. Finalized 2020 data released next year will list only one underlying cause of death. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is projecting that Africa's growth will drop to 1.8%, and perhaps lower.",
        "doc": "Writing in a national newspaper, Abubakar made a number of claims about the Nigerian economy, comparing the current administration's actions to Olusegun Obasanjo's and his own. The former VP was largely correct about the worrying amount Nigeria spends on repaying foreign debt and that the United Nations has predicted lower growth for Africa because of the coronavirus pandemic. While he was also right about the price of oil when he took office, compared to today, he bungled facts about the repayment of debts under his watch, and economists warn it is difficult to directly compare government expenditure today to that of the 1990s. Former Nigeria vice president Atiku Abubakar recently criticised the current administration's plan to borrow nearly US$6.9 billion, saying the country should instead seek debt relief and push for higher oil prices. Nigeria is looking for $6.9 billion from three multilateral lenders. Finance minister Zainab Ahmed has said this is to cushion the country from \"existential threats\" due to the Covid-19 pandemic and falling prices of oil, its top foreign exchange earner. Writing in the daily Vanguard newspaper in April 2020, Abubakar, who has vied for the presidency four times, made a number of statements to support his position. We fact-checked six. We asked the former vice president to provide evidence for his claims and for clarifications where necessary. We will update this report when he responds. The first cases of the novel coronavirus outside mainland China were reported in January 2020, according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria spent N2.1 trillion (about US$6.9 billion at the current official exchange rate ) to service its debt in 2019, according to the country's debt management office . Of this, N1.69 trillion ($5.5 billion) was for domestic debt, and N408 billion ($1.3 billion) for foreign debt. Nigeria's revenue in 2019 was N4.77 trillion , according to the country's central bank . This came from sources such as oil and gas, value added tax, corporate tax and custom duty. Taken as a proportion of this revenue, about 44% was spent servicing debt. We therefore rate Abubakar's figure of 42% as mostly correct. Economist warns debt servicing level 'unsound' Economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check that while there are \"valid reasons\" for the debt owed by the government, using nearly half of the country's earnings to repay it was unsound in the long run. \"In the face of dwindling revenue, governments take loans for projects and to keep the country running. However, debt servicing taking over 40% of the country's earnings is not sustainable,\" Olomola, who teaches at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife , said. The UN's Economic Commission for Africa focuses on the economic and social development of the continent. Abubakar said it was inevitable that Africa would take an economic hit from the pandemic, and said the agency had already revised growth projections for the region. A spokesperson for the commission, Privat Akochaye, directed Africa Check to a French-language report published in April 2020. This showed that the agency had pared back its growth forecast for the region for 2020, from 3.2% to between 1.8% and 2% in a best-case scenario. But this could shrink to 0.1% or, in a worst-case scenario, to as low as -2.6% . The commission therefore did revise its projections, though these forecasts tend to often change as more information becomes available. The former VP's point was that a crash in the price of oil should not automatically \"trigger a crisis\". Abubakar took office as president Olusegun Obasanjo's deputy on 29 May 1999, serving two terms until 2007. In May 1999, the price of Nigeria's main crude oil export, Bonny Light, was US $16.94 per barrel , according to historical data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries . On 8 April 2020, the day Abubakar's article was published, Bonny Light crude sold at $25.89 per barrel . Strictly interpreted, Abubaka was accurate that the price of oil was lower in 1999. Be cautious when comparing oil prices, says economist But comparing the prices of oil in 1999 and in 2020 should be done with caution, economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check. \"There is a need to consider economic fundamentals such as the changes in the demand for the commodity,\" he said. \"The US for instance was buying more crude oil from Nigeria in 1999 than it is buying today. It's not just about the price. Even if it rises to $100 per barrel, if there are no buyers, it would make no difference,\" he said. Returning to a familiar 2019 presidential campaign talking point , Abubakar compared debt levels during his time as VP with those of the current administration of president Muhammadu Buhari. When he exited office in 2007, Nigeria's foreign debt had been \"paid off\", Abubakar said. Is this accurate? A highlight of the Obasanjo administration was a debt cancellation deal it negotiated with the \" Paris Club \", an informal group of 22 creditor countries. In 2005 the creditors wrote off $18 billion of the roughly $30 billion Nigeria had owed them at the end of 2004. This was 84% of the country's foreign debt as at December 2004 . Nigeria still had to pay $12.4 billion , according to the public announcement by the group, which was made in April 2006. Nigeria also paid its debt to private banks known as the \"London Club\" in a similar deal. The country's debt office showed this was done in 2007. But this statement of accounts showed Nigeria's foreign debt was $3.54 billion at the end of 2006 and $3.65 billion at the end of 2007. The data shows the Obasanjo government did not settle Nigeria's foreign debt as the VP claimed. They handed over to a new government in May 2007. That year, Nigeria still spent more than $1 billion to service foreign debts. Abubakar also faulted the recent approval of a reported N37 billion to renovate the national assembly, which he said was \"built from scratch\" for less than a fifth of this. Nigeria's plan to spend this amount, approved in December 2019, is the subject of public debate . The contract to initially build the national assembly was awarded in February 1996, with construction lasting two and a half years. The company that built it has given the value of the contract as N7 billion . But the value of Nigeria's currency has depreciated significantly over the years, economics professor Philip Olomola told Africa Check. When comparing the two figures, one \"should consider factors such as changes in exchange rate and in the cost of construction equipment and material\", the economist said. Difficult to do a direct comparison In 1996 the exchange rate was N21.9 to the US dollar . This means about $320 million was devoted to the construction of the complex. In December 2019, when the renovation budget was approved, the official exchange rate was N306 to the dollar , or $121 million. Olomola said the purchasing power of N7 billion in 1996 is likely to be more valuable than that of N37 billion today. Building costs higher in 2020 than 1996, says quantity surveying expert The cost of building equipment and material has also generally increased over the years, King Nyenke , a professor of quantity surveying at the Rivers State University , told Africa Check. Nyenke said that if he were provided with the same bill of quantity as in 1996, the cost of building it now \"would be higher\" than N7 billion. Because of the changes in these fundamentals, it is difficult to know for certain if the repair bill for the national assembly would be less than 20% what it cost to construct it. So we rate this claim as unproven. The hospital at the president's official residence is often reported as being ill-equipped and barely functional despite being allocated a large budget every year. \"It is virtually useless as we face the most significant public health challenge of our national life,\" Abubakar wrote, claiming that N13 billion was allocated to the hospital in the five years to 2020. A similar claim was published by the Daily Trust newspaper on 6 April. Budget documents of 2016 to 2020 differ The budget allocation to the facility in the 2016 budget \u2013 the first of Buhari's administration \u2013 was N2.83 billion . It dropped to N331.7 million in the 2017 budget before rising to N1.03 billion in the 2018 budget. In 2019 N799 million was budgeted for the hospital, and N723 million for 2020. The total is about N5.7 billion \u2013 less than half Abubakar's claim. (Note: The amounts released are sometimes less than what's budgeted, but a lack of historical data on budget implementation makes it difficult to know the exact amount that reached the hospital over the period.)",

        "doc": "In April 2017, the entertainment web siteThe Last Line of Defensepublished a series of false articles concerningU.S. Representative Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), a criminal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and multiple mysterious deaths. Gowdy is the chairman ofthe Select Committee on Benghazi, and squared off against Clinton in 2016 during an eight-hour hearing on the attack on a U.S. consulate and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, when Clinton was Secretary of State. The attacks have sparked multiple conspiracy theories. In addition toinventing astory claiming that a former Clinton assistant was found dead shortly before he was to testify about Benghazi, The Last Line of Defense has also published at least two other fake news articles on the topic. One claimed that two of Trey Gowdy\u2019s investigators were found dead in Arkansas, while a second claimed that Gowdy had been forced into hiding. All of these stories are fictional. The Last Line of Defenseis an entertainment web site with a penchant for fake news. The web site,which has a long history of publishing misinformation, carries a disclaimer labeling its content as satirical: DISCLAIMER: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real. In addition to their publication on a fake news site, there were several other ways to deduce that these items were false. The article claiming that two of Gowdy\u2019s investigators were found dead in Arkansas included two images from an unrelated event: The first image (left) was taken from an ABC News video about a \u201cbody farm\u201d in Tennessee where researchers studied the decomposition of corpses, and the second image (right) was taken in 2014 and shows authorities removing the body ofArnis Zalkalns, the suspected killer of Alice Gross who took his own life, from the woods in West London. The rumor that Gowdy was \u201cforced into protective custody\u201d also doesn\u2019t hold up in light of the politician\u2019s recent appearances. On 24 April 2017, for instance, Gowdy delivered a speech at South Carolina\u2019s Converse College, something that would surely be impossible if Gowdy was in protective custody.",

Other versions of the claim have spread widely on Facebook and Instagram.But the claim is false.The article misconstrues the facts around a new traffic reduction plan approved by the Oxford County Council in Oxfordshire, U.K., in November. The new traffic reduction system will restrict drivers from accessing certain main roads during daytime hours through the use of \"traffic filters.\"The city will utilize traffic cameras to track and fine drivers who drive in certain areas at certain times, but no physical barriers will be added to roads. Residents will be free to move around the city and utilize other streets and modes of transportation.USA TODAY reached out to Watts Up With That? and several Facebook and Instagram users who shared the claim for comment.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksA joint statement from the Oxfordshire County and City Councils acknowledged the barrage of erroneous posts circulating online and said the claims were incorrect.\u201cStaff and counselors at both councils have been subjected to abuse due to inaccurate information, being circulated online, about traffic filters,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe traffic filters are not physical barriers of any kind and will not be physical road closures. They are simply traffic cameras that can read number plates.\u201dCouncillor Liam Walker, who opposed the traffic filters plan, called the claims of a climate lockdown \"completely untrue.\"\"Residents aren\u2019t on lockdown & traffic can enter/exit the different zones,\" he said in a tweet. \"Attack them on the facts not on conspiracy theories.\"Traffic congestion has been a notable issue in Oxford for years.Drivers who choose to ignore the traffic filters and drive on these roads will be fined \u00a370, roughly the equivalent of $85.Vehicles such as buses, taxis, motorcycles and emergency vehicles, as well as bicycles and pedestrians, will still have free access to these roads. Car owners will be able to apply for daylong permits to bypass the new traffic filters without being fined.Tom Jennings, a communication manager at Oxford City Council, said the city will remain accessible to all residents by car regardless if they've applied for a permit or not.\"Residents will still be able to drive to every part of the city at any time,\" he told Australia Associated Press. \"But in the future, during certain times of the day, you may need to take a different route \u2013 e.g. using the ring road \u2013 if you want to travel by car.\u201dJennings did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.These kinds of traffic filters have been previously utilized by the county and other cities across the U.K. in a bid to manage congestion and support public transport.Fact check: 'Rockefeller Playbook' and 'Operation Lockstep' are hoaxesThe Watts Up With That? article claims the traffic plan is part of a conspiracy to confine residents to their neighborhoods, which they call the \"15 minute city agenda.\"But those claims conflate the new traffic plan and another proposal made by the Oxfordshire City Council that seeks to promote access to essential services so they are within a 15-minute walk of all residents.Avni Gupta, a senior communications officer at Oxfordshire County Council, confirmed the plans were unrelated in a statement to the Australia Associated Press.The posts misstate the aim of the Council proposal, which was based in part on the 15-Minute City concept coined by Carlos Moreno of Pantheon Sorbonne University.\"The 15-minute neighborhoods proposal aims to ensure that every resident has all the essentials (shops, healthcare, parks) within a 15-minute walk of their home,\" the Oxfordshire County and City Councils said in a joint statement. \"They aim to support and add services, not restrict them.\"There's no mention of confining residents to their communities or splitting cities up into sectors on the 15-Minute City website or in either Council proposal.Other outlets, including PolitiFact and Reuters, also debunked this claim.Fact check: The coronavirus pandemic isn\u2019t slowing climate changeBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim the Oxfordshire government voted to test a \"climate lockdown\" in 2024. The action in question is a traffic congestion plan to reduce overcrowding and improve public safety. The new plan will utilize \u201ctraffic filters\u201d on some main roads, penalizing some drivers for accessing these roads during daytime hours if they don't have a permit. None of the roads will be physically blocked, and everywhere within the city will remain accessible by car.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

        "claim": "Says \"67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce.\"",
        "doc": "Marriage ends in divorce sometimes.In fact, it happens two-thirds of the time, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney.And if same-sex couples are allowed to wed in New Jersey, they would face the same marital woes heterosexual couples do, Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said in a Feb. 10 interview on WNYC\u2019s \"The Brian Lehrer Show.\"A caller asked Sweeney whether he has considered what would happen to the children of a gay or lesbian couple in a divorce. Sweeney said it\u2019d be no different than when a man and a woman divorce.\"You would go through the same process and a court would make a decision. You know, because sometimes courts do rule the father is the better parent than the mother. So, you know, each case is just like any divorce,\" Sweeney said. \"And you know something, divorces will happen, absolutely, just like they happen for heterosexuals and probably, what's it, 67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce.\"PolitiFact New Jersey found Sweeney\u2019s claim is off. But as Skip Burzumato, assistant director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, put it: \"divorce rates are such slippery statistics,\" which can vary dramatically depending on age, sex, race and education.Spokesmen for Sweeney did not respond to five e-mails and two phone calls requesting comment. Burzumato, who called the 67 percent figure an \"odd number,\" said if Sweeney\u2019s statistic was true for all marriages, \"I think we would feel that and we would all know that. We would not see as many married people as we do.\"One measure of divorce rates is the number of divorces in a given year per 1,000 people. The United States had a divorce rate of 3.4 by that measure in 2009, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Another approach cited more often is to estimate the likelihood a marriage will end in divorce.Generally, experts we spoke with and studies we consulted agreed that the likelihood of marriages ending in divorce fell somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent.\"Estimates of divorce are around 45%. When you throw in a few percent of couples who separate but never get around to divorcing, the figure of 50% is close,\" Paul Amato, a professor of family sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University, wrote in an e-mail. \"The probability of divorce is unlikely to rise further. In anything, it appears to be going down slightly.\"\"I think there is some truth to the fact that half of marriages end in divorce,\" Casey Copen, an associate service fellow with the National Survey of Family Growth, said. But, she said, \"it\u2019s just so dependent on the population you\u2019re looking at.\"For example, studies show couples with higher levels of education are less likely to divorce.Burzumato put the likelihood of marriages now ending in divorce slightly lower, between 35 percent and 45 percent, but said \"it might be in the 50s, it\u2019s hard to tell.\" \"What we have found is that divorce rates are coming down,\" he said. \"Cohabitation is on the rise. So those who do select marriage tend to be more committed.\"The U.S. Census Bureau reported similar findings.\"As marriage rates have decreased and cohabitation has become more common, marriage has become more selective of adults who are better off socioeconomically and have more education, and divorce rates have leveled,\" a May 2011 report said.Our rulingIn a radio interview, Sweeney said that 67 percent of marriages end in divorce.We found no data to support Sweeney\u2019s claim and his office did not return multiple requests for clarification.The chance of a marriage ending in divorce varies depending on a number of factors, including education and race. But overall, experts told us and reports show the overall probability of marriages now ending in divorce falls between 40 percent and 50 percent.We rate the statement False.To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",

        "claim": "Says Hillary Clinton \"plans to massively increase admissions (of Middle East refugees) \u2026 including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.\"",
        "doc": "The mass shooting inside an Orlando nightclub is even more evidence that the United States needs to restrict the number of foreigners coming into the country, Republican Donald Trump argued in a speech attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton. Refugees are potential terrorists, Trump said, and when it comes to refugees, \"our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions, without a screening plan, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me. Tell me, how stupid is that?\" Trump\u2019s claim that there is no screening plan rates False; there is a screening plan. But we also wondered if Clinton wanted to bring in that many more Syrian refugees from Syria, a country devastated by warring factions. When the refugees began making their way to Germany and other European countries, with many men, women and children dying in the process, there was concern that the United States was not helping European countries deal with the influx. During a Sept. 20 appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, Clinton was asked if President Barack Obama's plan to increase the number allowed into the United States to 10,000 was enough. (The United States hadaccepted about 2,000 in 2015.) \"Look, we\u2019re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,\" Clinton said. Clinton said she would be \"looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.\" A jump to 65,000 would be a 550 percent increase. To put this in context, Clinton has also made it clear that, under her administration, the United States wouldn't blindly accept anyone from Syria. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a Dec. 15, 2015, speech she made at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis. \"We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,\" Clinton said. \" Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it\u2019s a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.\" \"It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones,\" she said. \"So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria.\" Our ruling Trump said Clinton \"plans to massively increase admissions (of Middle East refugees) \u2026 including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.\" Clinton has, in fact, said that in response to the refugee crisis she would raise Obama's limit of 10,000 to 65,000. That's 550 percent more, a bit higher than what Trump said. But Clinton has also made it clear that they would have to first be vetted by a screening process, an important detail in the context of Trump's larger point that would-be terrorists have to be kept out of the country. Because the statement is mostly accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.",

        "claim": "Nyunggai Warren Mundine spoke of his full support for a constitutionally enshrined national Indigenous voice at a 2017 event.",
        "doc": "It\u2019s being claimed a lead campaigner against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice once fully supported the idea of a constitutionally enshrined national body. Social media users are referencing a 2017 speech by \u2018no\u2019 campaign group Recognise a Better Way \u2018s head Nyunggai Warren Mundine in which they claim he spoke in full support of a constitutionally-enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament. But his comments have been taken out of context. Mr Mundine has never fully endorsed a nationally enshrined voice, but in the past has called for a grassroots approach involving local bodies. Clips of his speech have spread online in the lead-up to the referendum . Many of the posts feature a truncated quote from the event. In one example, the caption of a Facebook post (archived here ) claims: \u201cWarren Mundine speaking in 2017 to Melbourne Law School in FULL SUPPORT of a constitutionally enshrined indigenous voice to parliament.\u201d The quote attributed to Mr Mundine in the post reads: \u201cWe need to have a Voice, we need to be heard, we need to be seen. But we also need guarantees that we just don\u2019t have bodies set up and then they\u2019re destroyed by governments at government\u2019s will. We actually have to have bodies that are fully recognised and have the force of law and constitutional law behind them.\u201d Another post (archived here ) included the same quote along with the caption: \u201cSix years ago, Warren Mundine supported a Voice to Parliament. So, why has he changed his mind?\u201d However, the full version of his speech reveals important context. In an earlier part, Mr Mundine explains how he is critical towards the idea of a national voice but is \u201cslowly shifting in support of it.\u201d However, he states he hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen won over by it\u201d and adds caveats, including that any voice \u201cneeds to come from the ground\u201d and local bodies need to be consolidated before a national voice is created. The next passage includes the truncated quote used in many of the social media posts: \u201cThe natural flow to me is that we will end up with a national body which will have the voice of what Indigenous people are saying on the ground \u2026 So I\u2019m presenting that argument \u2013 we need \u2013 it\u2019s a continuation of Noel (Pearson) \u2018s argument, that we need to have a Voice, we need to be heard, we need to be seen. \u201cBut we also need guarantees that we just don\u2019t have bodies set up and then they\u2019re destroyed by governments at government\u2019s will. We actually have to have bodies that are fully recognised and have the force of law and constitutional law behind them.\u201d His speech on May 19, 2017 at the Melbourne Law School is based on an essay published by Uphold and Recognise . In the essay, Mr Mundine advocates for \u201cFederal Parliament to legislate for the creation of local representative bodies\u201d rather than a \u201cconstitutional centralised national body\u201d (Page 10). Mr Mundine was speaking in the days leading up to the signing of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. \u201cLocal bodies, as opposed to a single national body, would represent recognised \u2018peoples\u2019 or \u2018nations\u2019, to ensure that they are anchored and accountable to an identifiable group of people; but will not validate the idea of a nation divided between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. \u201cDoing so also makes it less likely future governments may legislate for State-based bodies or a singular national body that undermines the spirit of local representation,\u201d he writes. Both his essay and speech were published before the Uluru Statement from the Heart calling for a national, constitutionally-enshrined voice to parliament was released at the national convention held from May 23-26, 2017 . A few days after the convention, Mr Mundine penned an opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review responding to calls within the Uluru Statement from the Heart to establish a \u201cFirst Nations Voice enshrined in the constitution.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always disagreed with this proposal and still do,\u201d he wrote, describing it as a \u201ctop-down lawyers\u2019 proposal.\u201d In an opinion piece published in The Australian on July 21, 2023, Mr Mundine responded to the recent accusations he has changed his position on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret I published an essay six years ago for Uphold & Recognise, written before the Uluru Statement, advocating for a model of recognition that supports traditional owner groups having a say on their own languages, cultures, heritage, land and sea. And that\u2019s a key reason I don\u2019t support the voice. Because a national, representative Indigenous body will undermine traditional owner rights to speak for their own countries,\u201d he wrote. The claim has also been addressed by RMIT ABC Fact Check here . The Verdict The claim that leading \u2018no\u2019 campaigner Nyunggai Warren Mundine spoke of his full support for a constitutionally enshrined national Indigenous voice at a 2017 event is false. Mr Mundine did not speak of his full support at the Melbourne Law School event. Instead, he told the audience he was not won over by the concept. His other statements from around the time are more explicit. In particular, in a newspaper column following the signing of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, he said he was against its proposed enshrined national voice. False \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.

        "doc": "Mudavadi was mostly correct that Kenya spends more on repaying debt than on its development expenditure. This has been the trend for the past six years, since the start of the Kenyatta administration. While Mudavadi was also correct that the budget for the judiciary is about half that allocated to parliament, he fudged some crucial facts in his explanations of why this shouldn't be so. It is incorrect and misleading to say courts sit for six days a week compared to parliament's three, and Mudavadi was also incorrect about the number of staff employed by both institutions. The state of Kenya's economy continues to animate public discussions , as the cash-strapped government tries to make ends meet. On 11 June 2020 treasury cabinet secretary Ukur Yatani gave a much-watched budget statement in the national assembly. In reaction, opposition politician Musalia Mudavadi , himself a former finance minister, poked holes in the spending plan for the new financial year which started on 1 July. In an interview on national TV on 11 June, Mudavadi specifically criticised the allocation for debt repayments, and also focused on funding for parliament and the judiciary . The former vice president and deputy prime minister has recently been critical of the government's handling of the economy.  On TV he made six key claims which we took a closer look at. We asked Mudavadi for evidence for the claims, and will update this report with his response. In the interview, he frequently referred to Yatani's budget statement. Claim 'We are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure.' Verdict correct Current levels of the public debt are a national talking point. There is a proposal to set up an agency to oversee this. In his speech, Yatani said Kenya had to be \"cautious about future debt accumulation\" and would look to borrow cheaply. But the budget had not shown any urgency to correct a \"critical landmine\", Mudavadi said. He gave the amount set aside for debt repayment as \"KSh900 billion, almost KSh1 trillion\". \"We are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure,\" he said . \"This is a crisis!\" How much for loan payments? How much has been budgeted for debt repayment?  A report from the national assembly's budget committee said that debt service for the 2020/21 financial year was an estimated KSh904.7 billion. The cost of debt financing \"actually consumes more financial resources than development expenditure for which the debt is obtained\", the committee said . What about for development projects? The budget committee approved KSh637.6 billion as the development budget. The treasury had proposed KSh584.3 billion, while minister Yatani said the amount was KSh633.1 billion in his budget speech. All these figures are less than that set aside for repaying debt. To evaluate how much money has been used over the years to repay debt and for development, the monthly statements issued by treasury are beneficial, James Muraguri told Africa Check. He is the chief executive of the Institute of Public Finance-Kenya . \"This is the best document to use because it provides the actual money that is released out of the consolidated fund,\" Muraguri said. The consolidated fund is where all income raised and revenues collected by the national government is kept. The fund first provides for obligatory payments such as debt repayments, salaries for some state officers and pensions. Only after these are paid can other departments access the money. We checked all the treasury's annual statements since 2013, when president Uhuru Kenyatta's administration started, to establish if debt repayments exceeding the development budget was a once off, or a trend. Debt service versus development expenditure Financial year Debt service (KSh bn) Development expenditure (KSh bn) 2013/14 227.6 224.4 2014/15 416.2 270.3 2015/16 421.8 333.2 2016/17 435.7 394.2 2017/18 517.2 276.4 2018/19 826.2 306.5 TOTAL 2,844.7 1,805 The numbers show debt repayments have exceeded the development budget for the last six financial years. The budgeted figures for the 2019/20 financial year, which ended 30 June, also show debt service was expected to take up KSh696.6 billion, while the development budget was KSh704.2 billion. However, by 29 May, a month before the end of the financial year, KSh639.2 billion had been issued to pay debts, while KSh295 billion had been issued for development expenditure. We therefore rate Mudavadi's claim as correct. What's the crisis? Kenya's economy is import dependent , James Muraguri, the chief executive of the Institute of Public Finance-Kenya told Africa Check. This means it imports the bulk of goods meant for its domestic market. More than half of Kenya's public debt is owed to foreign creditors. Servicing this debt and paying for its imports must be in dollars. With this crucial foreign currency leaving the country, the country's economy can be left exposed. \"The pressure on the current account at the central bank will be felt due to demand for the [US] dollar and the shilling losing ground,\" Muraguri said. (Note: For more on the functions of foreign exchange reserves, read here . ) Claim 'Parliament is getting KSh38 billion, the judiciary is getting KSh18 billion, basically 50% [of parliament's allocation].' Verdict mostly-correct In the budget speech, the finance minister proposed funding of KSh37.3 billion to parliament and KSh18.1 billion to the judiciary for the 2020/21 financial year. The estimates approved by parliament show that it will get KSh37.7 billion while the judiciary will get KSh18.1 billion . The judiciary's budget works out to about 48% of parliament's allocation. We therefore rate Mudavadi's statement as mostly correct. Claim 'Remember the judiciary sits six days in a week \u2026' Verdict incorrect Mudavadi claimed that when not following the revised timetable set in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, the courts sit six days in a week. His argument was that the judiciary was underfunded. \"Sometimes they are called even on a Saturday, in an emergency,\" he said. We asked the judiciary if this was correct. \"Courts do not usually sit on Saturday or Sunday unless they have express permission from the chief justice in writing, and that has to be under exceptional circumstances,\" Catherine Wambui , acting director of communications at the judiciary, told Africa Check. She said this was rare, and cited the 14-day deadline imposed by Kenya's constitution within which presidential election petitions must be determined as an example of when this had happened. During presidential election petition hearings in 2013 and in 2017, the judiciary sat on Saturday and Sunday. But it is not the norm for Kenyan courts to sit six days a week. They sit from Monday to Friday and do not sit on public holidays. Judicial staff may also be called in to work on public holidays to \"to perform certain essential duties\", according to the judiciary's human resources manual . Claim '... and parliament sits three days a week.' Verdict misleading The sittings of both houses of Kenya's parliament are prescribed in the standing orders. The national assembly is required to \"meet at 9.30 am on Wednesday and at 2.30 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday\". The senate meets at \"2.30 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday\". However, the rules allow each of the two houses, by resolution \"to meet at any other time on a sitting day; or to meet on any other day, in order to transact business\". Caroline Gaita is the chief executive of Mzalendo Trust , a project that keeps tabs on parliamentary performance in Kenya. She said the perception that sitting days are the only working days for the Kenyan parliament was misleading. Equating the sitting days to their working days is doing a disservice to their role, she told Africa Check. \"The work of a member of parliament cannot be limited to the three days when the house sits,\" she told Africa Check. \"That is for their legislative role. They have other roles such as oversight and representation which are done through committees and/or physical visits to the constituencies\". She added: \"On Fridays, throughout the weekend, and on Mondays they are usually in the constituencies. Committee meetings are usually held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.\" We therefore rate Mudavadi's claim as misleading. Claim 'The Judiciary has \"almost 7,000 employees\".' Verdict incorrect The latest state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. It covers the 2018/19 financial year and shows the judiciary had 5,584 employees on 30 June 2019. These were 153 judges, 546 magistrates and 4,885 other employees including registrars, legal researchers, law clerks and court assistants. In the financial year 2019/20 the judiciary was expected to hire 300 new employees. At the highest, the number of employees in the judiciary could only be 5,884. Mudavadi was off the mark by more than 1,000 employees. We therefore rate his claim as incorrect. Claim 'Compare that with parliament with about 1,000 employees.' Verdict incorrect Africa Check has previously fact-checked this claim and found out that Kenya's bicameral parliament had 9,940 staff as of 19 March 2019. The clerk of the senate , Jeremiah Nyegenye, who is also the secretary of the parliamentary service commission , the administrative arm of parliament, shared data with Africa Check showing that in March 2019 there were: 830 permanent and pensionable parliamentary staff, 282 contract staff, and 10 seconded staff 6,740 constituency staff in the 290 constituencies and 47 county offices 46 staff serving 12 nominated lawmakers In the senate, 940 staff serving 47 elected senators, and 64 serving nominated senators 1,022 police officers attached to lawmakers in both houses ( Note: We have reached out to Nyegenye about the latest employee numbers in parliament. We'll update this report when we get his response.) This is well over 1,000 employees. We therefore rate Mudavadi's claim as incorrect.",

        "claim": "For the second year running Kenya has achieved a transition rate of 100% from primary to secondary school.",
        "doc": "The president was accurate on many counts, including that the national curfew in response to the Covid-19 pandemic was the first put in place since independence in 1963. Kenyatta was also mostly on the money regarding matters of economy and trade. Kenya has increased its trade within the East African Community, helped loosen trade regulations across the continent, and improved in international ease-of-doing-business rankings. But while the textbook-to-pupil ratio in the first grades of school is nearly one to one, it is incorrect that 100% of students progress from primary to secondary education, and this repeats previously unproven claims. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIn November 2020 Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta reported on the state of the nation, nearly one and a half years since the last such address. The speech centred on his administration's efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its \"Big Four\" agenda that is focused on health, housing, manufacturing and food security. The president also made claims of progress in various areas from education and land to the business environment and electricity connections. We checked the accuracy of eight of Kenyatta's pronouncements. We have contacted the presidency for the source of the data used in the claims and will update this report with their response. To stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, in March 2020 Kenyatta said a nationwide curfew would be \"in effect in the territory of the republic of Kenya\" from 7 pm to 5 am. Starting on 27 March , the curfew's hours have varied. At the time of writing, it is in place until 3 January 2021 between 10 pm and 4 am. In his November address , Kenyatta said the curfew was \"Kenya's first ever nationwide curfew since independence\". The best records on curfews would be the legal notices published in the Kenya Gazette as required by the Public Order Act , Dr Mutuma Ruteere told Africa Check. Ruteere is the director of the Centre for Human Rights and Policy Studies in Nairobi. A former United Nations special rapporteur , he has written extensively on security, policing and terrorism in Kenya. \"When a curfew is declared, it has to be gazetted,\" Brian Kimari told us. He is a junior research fellow at the thinktank and has authored a policy brief on the curfew during the pandemic. Kimari could not find an instance of another nationwide curfew, and we also came up empty when we scoured the gazette's archives . Historic curfews regional or pre-independence The records do show that regional curfews have been declared before, in north-eastern Kenya in the 1960s and 70s during the shifta war and more recently during operations against the al-Shabaab terror group. Curfews were also in place in the cities of Nairobi and Nanyuki during the 1982 coup attempt , in some districts during various security operations, and during the 2007/08 post-election violence. A news article from March 2020 said a national curfew had been in place before but under a colonial era state of emergency, citing veteran Kenyan administrator Joseph Kaguthi. Kimari said that the reference to the curfew by Kenyatta was meant to signal that the pandemic is \"a very serious moment\" for the country, but it also cast a spotlight on the \" securitisation of the pandemic response \". \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenya's government took over the distribution of textbooks from schools in January 2018 . For the most recent data on this, Dr Emmanuel Manyasa directed us to the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development . He is the executive director of Usawa Agenda , an advocacy group in the education sector. The 2019 basic education statistical booklet notes that the education ministry distributed books \"on numeracy and literacy because they are the foundational skills in education\". \"The data shows that the 1:1 pupil-textbook ratio in mathematics, English and Kiswahili has almost been achieved in Grade 1, 2 and 3,\" the booklet says . It breaks this down by grade and enrolment.  The ratios have been rounded up, meaning some pupils were sharing books. For example, some 49,088 grade 1 pupils would not have had their own textbook. Why is the ratio important? According to the education ministry , pupils sharing textbooks with more than one other child achieved less. \"Ideally, more learning material should improve learning outcomes,\" Manyasa told Africa Check. But there were also other factors at play, he said, such as teacher shortages, especially in the rural areas. \u2013 Alphonce Shiundu Kenyatta compared this number to the six million title deeds he said had been issued from independence in 1963 to when he took office in 2013. He made the same claim in another national address in June 2020. ( Note: Since 2012 title deeds are also referred to as \"certificates of title\" in Kenya. They prove that the person named in the certificate owns the land. ) Since June 2020, the lands ministry website has claimed that 4.5 million deeds have been issued \"since 2013 compared to 5.6 million since independence\". In June Farida Karoney, the cabinet secretary for lands, gave Africa Check a similar number of 5.6 million from 1963 to 2012. From 2013 to June 2019 about 4.1 million deeds were issued, she said, and 388,000 from July to April 2020. The minister's figures added up to 4.49 million. We have asked Karoney for the number of deeds issued since April and will update this report once we receive a response. Only the ministry can confirm the number of deeds it has issued, the Kenya Land Alliance, a not-for-profit organisation that advocates for land reform in the country, previously told Africa Check. \u2013 Vincent Ng'ethe Every year, the World Bank publishes a report ranking how friendly countries make their economies to investors. The most recent, Doing Business 2020 , ranks Kenya 56th out of 189 countries.  In the sub-Saharan Africa region the country was third after Mauritius and Rwanda. The 2015 report , using data current as of June 2014, placed Kenya 136th. So on this score the president was accurate. The presidency has also cited the country's progress up the rankings in previous years . \u2013Vincent Ng'ethe World Bank pauses ease of doing business rankings The ease of doing business rankings have in recent years come in for international scrutiny . Kwame Owino is the chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs , a thinktank in Nairobi. In his view, the report is of questionable use, he told Africa Check. The methodology \"has been questioned within the World Bank itself\" and while the ranking is seen as an end in itself, it \"does not necessarily lead to more investment\". Owino also said the rankings were weighted in favour of large formal businesses. \"But if you know we have a huge informal sector, many of the things spoken about in the Ease of Doing Business report don't affect them as much.\" In Kenya, 83% of employment was in the informal sector , according to the 2020 economic survey . Further, he said, the report has an \"urban bias\" as it considers only the capital Nairobi and not the country's 46 other counties. On 27 August, the World Bank said that it was looking into irregularities around data published in the 2018 and 2020 Doing Business report. \"The publication of the Doing Business report will be paused as we conduct our assessment,\" the bank said. The African Continental Free Trade Area is expected to increase trade both within Africa and with other regions and has been described as the largest free trade area in the world based on the number of countries. The agreement establishing it was signed by 54 of the bloc's 55 members in March 2018 during an African Union summit in Rwanda. Eritrea has not yet signed. The agreement's status list shows Kenya was the first to ratify it on 6 May 2018, a day ahead of Ghana. Some 28 countries had ratified the agreement as of October 2019, meaning they agreed to be bound by its terms. \u2013 Vincent Ng'ethe According to Kenya Power , the country's electricity utility, \"last mile\" refers to the last link to the consumer's premise or home. In June 2020 we rated as unproven a claim by Kenyatta that the government had connected 8 million households to the electric grid. Because of a delay in appointing Kenya's auditor-general, the utility firm only published its 2018/19 annual report in November 2020. The report shows that in the year to June 2019, some 306,771 customers were connected to electricity. ( Draft treasury figures gave a figure of 440,822 customers .) As of 30 June 2019, the annual report showed Kenya Power had connected 5.4 million domestic consumers. Another 1.29 million were connected under the rural electrification programme, for a total of 6.7 million. Domestic connections accounted for 94.5% of all customers. This category has over the last five financial years accounted for at least a 90% share of the total. On its website, Kenya Power says that as of June 2020 it \"sells electricity to over 7.5 million\" but does not specify how many customers were domestic. The available data accounts for 6.7 million of the 7.2 million connections cited by the president. Kenya Power's 2019/20 annual report, to be published in January 2021, will likely give newer data but in its absence we rate the claim as unproven. \u2013 Vincent Ng'ethe The East African Community counts six member countries \u2013 Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The 2020 economic survey from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that in 2019, Kenya made KSh140 billion in exports to the other countries. This was the highest since 2013. The finalising of the community's common market protocol meant that its members were trading more with each other, Dr Paul Kamau told Africa Check. He is a senior fellow at the University of Nairobi's Institute for Development Studies and has published research on Kenya's trade in East Africa. \"This could be giving the business community more confidence,\" he said, adding that as markets such as the US and China get more competitive, there has been more focus on regional markets. \u2013 Vincent Ng'ethe In his previous state of the nation address in April 2019, the president claimed the country had achieved a 100% transition from primary to secondary school. We fact-checked the claim then and found it to be incorrect. There are conflicting claims about the transition rate in 2019. In February 2019, an education ministry report said the transition rate was 93%. Citing the ministry's data , the 2020 economic survey published by the national statistics office in April gave the transition rate for 2019 as 85.5%. The 2019 basic education statistical booklet from the ministry put it at 95% for 2019. A year later, in February 2020, education minister George Magoha claimed a 99.8% transition rate. We have contacted the education ministry for clarity. The available data however does not show a 100% transition rate in 2019 or 2020. Experts have previously told Africa Check that achieving this full rate is difficult in the absence of a law making secondary school compulsory. Secondary school is also not completely free and this will keep some students away. We therefore rate the president's claim as incorrect. \u2013 Vincent Ng'ethe",

The post, which ends with an Instagram link, was shared more than 12,000 times till the time of filing this story. Team India lost to New Zealand in the World Cup semi-finals on July 9. Even before the World Cup started, there were speculations that Dhoni might retire after the tournament. The speculations, coupled with Dhoni\u2019s silence, only multiplied after India\u2019s rout from the World Cup. There has been no official statement regarding Dhoni\u2019s future plans. We checked Dhoni\u2019s official Twitter account to check the authenticity of the claim but found that he hasn\u2019t tweeted after May 6. There is no update on his Facebook and Instagram accounts either. We also checked the Instagram link attached to the viral claim.

        "doc": "CLAIM The U.S. is not losing \u201ctons more lives in 2020\u201d compared to 2019 (18,433) ... the increase is virtually non-existent more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Candace Owens, Joe Hoft, Facebook, Gateway Pundit, 13 May 2020 DETAILS Misleading: The author calculated the number of deaths that occurred during a time window in 2020 that was inappropriate for assessing whether the COVID-19 epidemic impacted overall U.S. mortality (70% of the time period is prior to the onset of COVID-19). Lacks context : The post author neglected to explain that the CDC collects and reports death count data in a manner that results in underestimates in initial reports followed by rapid increases as new data becomes available. KEY TAKE AWAY A comparison of the number of deaths from all causes in the U.S. during the first 17 weeks of 2020 reveals a higher mortality than for the same period in any of the previous five years. While the death count was comparable to previous years in the first two months of 2020, it increased rapidly in March and April. Comparisons of mortality are highly sensitive to how the data are gathered and presented, therefore any claims based on the data must always be presented in the appropriate context. Since its outbreak in the U.S., COVID-19 has claimed more lives than diabetes, suicide, or stroke. FULL CLAIM: The U.S. is not losing \u201ctons more lives\u201d in 2020 compared to 2019. \u201cDeaths in 2019: 973,344. Deaths in 2020: 991,777...[the] increase\u2014virtually non-existent\u201d. SUMMARY A post shared on Facebook on 13 May 2020 compared the number of deaths in the U.S. during the first 17 weeks of 2019 (30 December 2018 to 27 April 2019) to those during the same period in 2020 (29 December 2019 to 25 April 2020)@. The post states that the number of additional deaths in 2020 is \u201cvirtually non-existent\u201d, or negligible. It further states that reports of high death counts are a \u201cmedia illusion\u201d. Allegations that the pandemic has had little to no impact on public health or mortality rates has been a recurring theme on social media. The author of the post uses these data to support her objection to \u201clockdowns\u201d, which have caused businesses to close temporarily to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The claims thus call for three verifications: Are the reported figures accurate? Are the figures relevant to the claim that COVID-19 is having little impact on the U.S. mortality rate in 2020? Is the increased mortality rate in 2020 \u201cnon-existent\u201d? 1. Are the reported figures accurate? The post reports the cumulative number of deaths from all causes in the U.S. from week 1 of 2020 through week 17, as provided in the mortality surveillance data released during week 18 (ending 2 May 2020) by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the time the post was written, the figures were indeed accurate. However, the post fails to mention that the provided death counts were preliminary and therefore underestimated the actual death count. The NCHS collects death certificates from every state and releases a weekly summary of the number of deaths. In the reports, deaths are grouped according to the week that they occurred, but many deaths that occur during a given week are not registered and communicated in time to be included in the mortality surveillance data released during that week. Therefore, each new weekly release of mortality data not only includes the new death count for the week that just ended, but also updates the death counts for all previous weeks based on any new death certificates that are submitted. As an example, the death count for week 10 of 2020 was reported as 56,652 in the NCHS release at the end of week 18, but was updated to 57,184 in the release at the end of week 19 (9 May). This means that 532 deaths that had occurred during week 10 were not communicated in time to be included in the week 18 release and were only added to the week 19 release. The death count for a particular week therefore continues to change with each weekly release of new data\u2014a fact that the post\u2019s author failed to take into account.The changes can be quite dramatic: The author used data for week 17 (19-25 April) that was reported during week 18\u2014indicating 47,526 deaths. But this number jumped to 57,680 in the week 19 update\u2014an additional 10,154 deaths. To get an updated and more accurate picture of the death count in the U.S., Health Feedback used data from the week 19 release to reanalyze the death count from week 1 through week 17, which is the same period that was cited in the Facebook post (Figure 1). We compared the cumulative number of deaths in 2020 (red curve) to the average cumulative number of deaths that occurred during the first 17 weeks of the previous five years (2015 \u2013 2019)#. This approach is more reliable than if we only consider the data from 2019. The figure below illustrates that the number of deaths in 2020 started to diverge from the average of the past five years at week 13. At week 15, it rose above the range of values for the previous five years (grey shaded area), indicating that 2020 is currently the deadliest year of the last six years (2015 \u2013 2020). This updated analysis thus shows that there has indeed been noticeably more deaths in 2020 compared to past years. For the first 17 weeks of 2020, total deaths from all causes numbered 1,014,090, which is an increase of 40,726 deaths (+4.2%) relative to 2019 and 50,069 (+5.2%) relative to the 5-year average. 2. Are the figures presented in the post relevant to the claim that COVID-19 is having little impact on the U.S. mortality in 2020? In addition to using preliminary data that underestimated mortality, the author chose a time period for her analysis which includes deaths that occurred before the outbreak began in this U.S.\u2014this has the effect of obscuring the magnitude of the impact of the outbreak on the mortality after it began. In January, the best estimates indicate that the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. was low to zero. The first officially recorded case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on 19 January 2020[1], although some undetected cases may have occurred sporadically before that. The first local chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported at the end of January[2] and the first death of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 likely occurred in early February. As the CDC reports, the number of COVID-19-positive patients did not start to increase sharply until week 13 (22 \u2013 28 March). This means that 12 out of the 17 weeks chosen for analysis by the post\u2019s author included few to no deaths from COVID-19. The chosen time window is therefore not appropriate for assessing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality, because 70% of that time window included a period when the epidemic had not fully hit the U.S. A more appropriate and representative way to analyze the mortality trend is to look at the weekly number of deaths over time, rather than the cumulative number of deaths, in order to spot any mortality in excess of what has typically been observed in previous years. This is similar to what the Financial Times reported in other countries. Figure 2 presents the weekly number of deaths in 2020 for weeks 1 to 17 as reported in the week 19 NCHS release, and compares these numbers to the average weekly number of deaths that occurred in the previous five years$. The number of new COVID-19 cases detected per week is also shown for reference and was obtained by aggregating the daily count of new cases from the GitHub repository of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The figure clearly shows that the number of deaths per week in January and February 2020 was similar to previous years. Around mid-March, however, just after the week when the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases started to increase (green curve), the number of deaths from all causes per week in the U.S. increased dramatically to a level far above the average weekly mortality during the same time period for the previous five years. At week 15, the number of deaths per week in 2020 peaked at more than 70,000, which is around 20,000 more deaths per week than what would normally be expected (as shown by the black line representing the previous 5-year average). As mentioned above, the deaths in more recent weeks tend to be underreported, which could explain part of the downward trend in the most recent weeks. Notably, the number of U.S. deaths from all causes started to drop beginning at week 15 after social distancing measures began being implemented in many states in mid-March, although the mortality rate still has not returned to baseline levels, even after more than two months of these measures. The number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases showed a similar downward trend. The CDC similarly presented an estimate of the number of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d for the 2017 to 2020 period&. The orange line in Figure 3 represents a threshold above which the number of deaths is abnormally high compared with the mortality for previous years in the country. The figure clearly shows that the period from week 13 to week 17 in 2020 experienced \u201cexcess deaths\u201d, coinciding with the increase in COVID-19 infections in the U.S. 3. Is the increased mortality in 2020 really \u201cnon-existent\u201d? The Facebook post claims that the U.S. has not sustained \u201ctons more deaths\u201d in 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. This statement is subjective and, as a result, is difficult to assess. The quantification of excess mortality by the CDC (Figure 3) shows that the percentage of weekly excess deaths during week 13 through week 17 in 2020 varied from 6% to 33% and peaked at week 15. For comparison, the peak of excess deaths recorded during the exceptionally strong flu epidemic during the winter of 2017-2018 only reached 11% (week 2 of 2018). This shows that the excess mortality that the U.S. experienced in April 2020 is far greater than that recorded during a particularly strong flu season. Another way to grasp the magnitude of the increase in COVID-19-related excess deaths in 2020 is to compare the numbers to the death tolls arising from other major causes of death. Health Feedback analyzed the death count provided by the NCHS from the day of the earliest reported death, which appeared to have occurred during week 6, to the end of week 17, which marks the latest time point included in the analysis by the author of the Facebook post. This covers a period of 12 weeks from 2 February to 25 April. According to the provisional death count for COVID-19 provided in the 21 May 2020 update, the death toll for that period was 54,529 (if we included weeks 18-20, this number would reach 71,339). (Note that this figure was accurate at the time of this review\u2019s publication and is subject to increase as new death certificates are continually processed by the CDC.) Using the most recent data from the CDC on the leading causes of death in the U.S. during 2017, we can see that COVID-19 claimed more lives over the 12 weeks in which the outbreak was actively spreading in the U.S. (from week 6 through week 17) than accidents, stroke, diabetes, suicide, and other conditions (Figure 4) during an equivalent period of time, even after accounting for the population increase from 2017 to 2020%. STAT News reached a similar conclusion in an article published on 9 April, albeit with a different methodology. The fact that COVID-19 ranked third in the list of leading causes of death in the U.S. during the 12 weeks from February to the end of April shows that COVID-19 cannot be ignored as possible contributor to the unusual increase in the number of U.S. deaths, which as our calculations here demonstrate, was not \u201cnon-existent\u201d. In summary, the Facebook post correctly reported the total number of deaths in the U.S. from week 1 through week 17 at the time it was written, using data released in week 18. However, the author failed to mention that these were preliminary data from the CDC and that underestimated the actual death count. More accurate numbers released by the NCHS recently (week 19) show that the death count for the first 17 weeks of 2020 was higher than during the same time period in 2019 by an additional 40,726 deaths. This number is likely to continue to increase as more up-to-date data becomes available. This highlights the risk of reporting preliminary data without also presenting the proper caveats. The post also compared mortality from a time period before the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S., which obscured the magnitude of the increase in mortality post-onset. A weekly comparison of mortality in 2020 with previous years clearly illustrates that 2020 mortality was abnormally high and coincided with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Finally, the post suggests that the increased death count in 2020 compared with 2019 is \u201cvirtually non-existent\u201d. While this assertion is subjective, it is nevertheless clear based on data analysis that the excess deaths in 2020, the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, were higher than during the flu epidemic of 2017-2018. The first 17 weeks of 2020 also saw more deaths due to COVID-19 than due to many other leading causes of death. These data make it hard to justify the characterization of the impacts of COVID-19 as \u201cnon-existent\u201d. A similar claim was made in a Gateway Pundit article stating that the total number of deaths in the U.S. \u201cin March 2020 [was] down 15% from the average of [the] prior four years\u201d. This claim is also misleading as it contains the same flaws that we explained above. Firstly, the authors failed to either notice or mention that the numbers they used were underestimates of the real death count. As we explained above, each weekly release from the CDC updates the death counts from the previous weeks to account for the arrival of new death certificates. The authors used the release of week 13 to calculate the number of deaths from week 9 to week 12. This was the latest available data at the time of their analysis, but is nonetheless preliminary and bound to increase with later updates. Such preliminary data should not be used to draw conclusions about whether the death count increased or decreased in 2020 compared to previous years. The latest available data, as of 30 May 2020, was released during week 21. Using the more accurate death counts contained in this release, the number of deaths during the period from week 9 to week 12 was updated from the preliminary count of 193,017 to 228,991. This updated number reflects a 1% increase in the number of deaths during this period compared to the average number of deaths for the previous four years during the same period. The authors\u2019 estimate of a 15% decrease is erroneous because it used incomplete data. Secondly, the authors used the death count in March to suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic was not a threat. At the time they wrote their article, the overall mortality in the U.S. indeed seemed only slightly higher than the average of the previous four years (based on the week 21 release of death counts). But this is because their analysis included the time period covering only the beginning of the epidemic in the U.S. Our Figure 2 shows that 2020 mortality did not begin to rise dramatically compared to previous years until April. Based on the week 21 death count release, the death toll in April (roughly, week 14 to week 17) was 280,357 in 2020 compared to the average of the previous four years (216,648). This amounts to a large and significant increase of 29%. NOTES @: The CDC numbers the weeks of the year as 1 to 52. Each week starts on a Sunday and ends on the following Saturday and are referred to either by number or by the date of the last day of the week. #: The cumulative number of deaths at a given week was calculated by adding the number of new deaths that occurred during that week to the sum of all the deaths that occurred during the preceding weeks. The dataset used was the weekly release of week 19. Note that death counts are updated in each successive release by the NCHS. The 5-year average was calculated by averaging, week by week, the cumulative number of deaths for the years 2015 through 2019. $: The number of deaths from all causes was directly obtained from the week 19 release of data by the NCHS. The number of deaths calculated for each week during the years 2015 to 2019 represent five data points each\u2014one for each of the five years. The black curve in Figure 2 represents the average of the five death counts and the grey area represents the range covered by the raw values. Note that death counts are updated in each successive release by the NCHS. The number of daily COVID-19-positive tests was obtained from Johns Hopkins University. The daily numbers in a given week were summed to yield a weekly number. Note that this does not account for variations in the overall number of tests carried out. However, the CDC reports the proportion of positive results among the tests carried out by public health laboratories and clinical laboratories and also indicates a sharp increase in the percentage of COVID-19-positive patients from week 12 through week 13 of 2020. &: The number of deaths in Figure 3 are labeled \u201cpredicted number of deaths\u201d because the raw number of deaths collected by the CDC are being weighted in order to account for any underreporting of death certificates that may occur. More details are available in this technical note. %: The number of COVID-19 deaths were directly obtained from the 21 May provisional NCHS count. The number of deaths from other leading causes of death during a 12-week period was estimated from the total number of deaths from each cause during a full year (52 weeks). REFERENCES UPDATE (26 May 2020) Based on comments received by Health Feedback, this review has been updated to clarify that the reduction in the number of deaths observed in the most recent weeks of 2020 could partly be due to the underreporting of death certificates to the CDC, a bias that we accounted for and explained extensively in the review. We updated the graph shown in Figure 4 so that it displays the number of deaths from each leading cause of death per 100,000 inhabitants. This allows us to account for the increase in population size between 2017 and 2020. This update does not modify our original verdict. UPDATE (2 June 2020) A discussion of a similar claim made by another author was added at the bottom of the review.",

        "claim": "Says 3,000 people \"did not die\" in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. That death toll estimate was \"done by Democrats.\"",
        "doc": "As Hurricane Florence battered the Carolinas, President Donald Trump stirred a tweetstorm of his own creation by continuing to deridean estimated death toll from two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico last year. Hesaidthe count of Puerto Ricans killed by Hurricane Maria jumped from 16 during his October visitto 64 deaths a few months later, and \"then, like magic, \u20183000 PEOPLE KILLED.'\" \u201cWhen Trump visited the island territory last October, OFFICIALS told him in a briefing 16 PEOPLE had died from Maria.\u201d The Washington Post. This was long AFTER the hurricane took place. Over many months it went to 64 PEOPLE. Then, like magic, \u201c3000 PEOPLE KILLED.\u201d They hired.... He said in a second tweet that a method by George Washington University researchers to come up with a death count \"was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY!\" ....GWU Research to tell them how many people had died in Puerto Rico (how would they not know this?). This method was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY! Trump\u2019s defiance echoed his initial tweets Sept. 13 in which he said 3,000 people \"did not die\" from the storms and that such a number was boosted by counting deaths from \"old age.\" Turning conspiratorial, he said it was \"done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible.\" 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000... .....This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico! Trump ignores basic facts about reality for Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Irma and Maria after September 2017. Trump also miscasts the estimate as a Democratic effort when it was created by experts on disaster response. There was no \"magic\" to the increase in the death toll estimates. It is based in science. \"Early after a disaster, death tolls tend to be preliminary,\" said Roberto Rivera, College of Business University of Puerto Rico. \"In the case of Hurricane Maria, indirect deaths are the reason the toll was so high, as suggested by some reports. That's the context that Trump is missing.\" The government in Puerto Rico initially reported 16 deaths in September 2017, and raised it to 34 in October and then 64 in December. But for months, researchers had said that the government\u2019s official count was an undercount. Part of a death toll is a count of direct deaths from a storm, such as being struck by a falling tree or drowning in a flood. The more complicated count comes from indirect deaths caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as someone who relies on a respirator but loses electricity. Usually, the death toll of an event such as Hurricane Maria is determined through an exam by a medical examiner. But Puerto Rico officials did not have the proper resources to effectively conduct forensic examinations. Without complete medical records, researchers were left with other ways to try to come up with an estimate. Multiple studies used different methodologies and time periods, and therefore arrived at different results about \"excess deaths\" \u2014comparing the number of deaths with historical trends during the time period in previous years. Excess death measurement has been a standard in the measurement of deaths attributable to environmental and climate events since the early 1960s, said Alexis Santos-Lozada, an assistant teaching professor at Pennsylvania State University. However, in some ways the case in Puerto Rico is unique. Before Hurricane Maria, governors and stakeholders were usually the first ones to raise alarm about the number of deaths \u2014as the mayor of New Orleans did after Hurricane Katrina. \"This was not the case of Puerto Rico, in Puerto Rico we turned to estimates because both the governor and the president minimized the number,\"Santos-Lozada said. Trump was referring to an estimate published in late August by George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute. That estimate was higher than some earlier estimates by academics and the New York Times that were around 1,000, but lower than the 4,645 midpoint of a Harvard study. Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 contactedGeorge Washington University in December, which led to commissioning the university to do a study. The Milken Institute published the first phase Aug. 28 and found a midpoint of 2,975 excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane. That number was 22 percent higher than the number of deaths that would have been expected during that period in a year without the storm. Researchers found that lack of communication and training for doctors about how to certify deaths resulted in an undercount. Trump misrepresents what the Milken Institute study actually concluded about deaths. The study did not include anyone who died for \"any reason, like old age,\" as he said. If that were the case, the number of deaths would have been much higher. The study found that there were 16,608 total deaths during the six months \u2014and approximately 77 percent were at least 65 years old. The study didn\u2019t attribute individual deaths to Maria; it tried to determine a number of \"excess\" deaths. In other words, it tried to findhow many deaths would have been expected were it not for thebut rather came up with a counterfactual: how many deaths would you expect to see each month if the hurricane hadn\u2019t happened and then subtract the actual number to arrive at an \"excess\" number of deaths. Dr. John \"Jack\" Sandberg, an associate professor in the department of global health, told PolitiFact that the contract stipulated that the study would be done with no government interference by officials in Puerto Rico \u2014and none occurred. \"I did the number crunching on this, no one ever said boo to me about anything,\" he said. \"We are quite shocked that this is having political repercussions.\" Lynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute, responded to Trump's tweets in a Washington Post op-ed. \"To set the record straight, our study was carried out with no interference whatsoever from any political party or institution,\" she wrote of the study done in collaboration with scientists at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. \"We do not know the exact circumstances around each of the 2,975\u2009excess deaths that occurred. Many factors \u2014 disruption in transportation, access to food, water, medications, power and other essentials \u2014 may have contributed.\" The government in Puerto Rico accepted the Milken institute study and raised Maria's official death toll from 64 to 2,975. The study's next phaseis expected to more closely examine the identified deaths to look at causes through interviews with family members and medical personnel. Trump tweeted that 3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that thedeath toll estimate was \"done by Democrats.\" Trump tried to cast doubt on an estimate by George Washington University that includes indirect deaths. Studies by other academics or researchers have also concluded that the number of deaths was above 1,000. The death toll provided by the government in Puerto Rico did rise after the storm from 16 to 64 in the months following the storm. The government then hired George Washington University to research an estimate and several months later it produced a report estimate 2,975 deaths. None of that is evidence of an estimate created by a Democratic conspiracy to make Trump look bad. We rate this statement False.",

Early Mon. morning 25 Jan,\u201d the first paragraph reads. Later that same day, the US House of Representatives formally charged Donald Trump with inciting the storming of the Capitol, triggering the first-ever impeachment trial of a former president.

Videos shared on Facebook here and here and on video hosting site BitChute here repeat and spread the claims made in the article. Contrary to the claims circulating online, Congress continues to function normally, and there have been no reputable reports of a mass arrest of legislators. All 100 members of the Senate voted on January 26, while 426 out of a possible 435 members of the House of Representatives took part in a vote on February 2. Hundreds of Trump supporters forced their way into the US Capitol building on January 6 in a riot sparked by false claims of election fraud, temporarily disrupting the certification by Congress of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. The National Guard was called up during the unrest, and reinforcements later came in from across the United States, bringing their numbers to more than 25,000 before Biden\u2019s inauguration on January 20. About 7,000 Guard troops will remain in Washington until roughly mid-March. Wayne Hall, a spokesman for the National Guard, told AFP over the phone, \u201cThe National Guard that are on the mission to support DC are doing so in support of local and federal law enforcement agencies. They\u2019re not operating on their own... The Guard is not the lead in DC.\u201d US Marshals Service spokesman Drew Wade said in an email: \u201cNo specially deputized National Guard members have executed any arrests in Washington, DC. Further, the arrest of a member of Congress would fall outside the scope of the authority granted by special deputation to a National Guard member.\u201d Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who leads the House of Representatives, called the claim \u201cfalse\u201d in an email. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s office also said by email that the claim is false. One line in the article appears to connect it to QAnon, a far-right movement claiming -- among other conspiracy theories -- that former president Donald Trump waged a secret war against a global liberal cult of Satan-worshipping pedophiles. \u201cWhen it was over and seemingly on Q, fireworks lit up the sky,\u201d the article reads. QAnon has spread from the fringes of social media to the mainstream, thanks to posts with global reach on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

The average tax rate in the industrialized world for businesses is 22.5 percent.\u201d Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), during an interview with the Associated Press, Sept. 13, 2017 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan wants Americans to start 2018 with a new tax system. After the Republican-controlled Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the pressure is mounting to pass major legislation. And Ryan is hoping to win on taxes. Congressional leaders are creating a framework for tax reform that they plan to unveil Sept. 25. In the meantime, Ryan is trying to garner support for a major overhaul of what he calls the United States\u2019 \u201cterrible tax system.\u201d On Sept. 13, Ryan sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his agenda. His main criticism of the tax code is that companies in the United States are taxed at a much higher rate than companies in other countries, which he says inhibits those companies from investing profits made overseas back into the United States. President Trump has made similar claims. Advertisement Regular readers of The Fact Checker know we\u2019ve called out politicians before for using dubious statistics to advance their tax agenda. During his interview, Ryan rehashed several of the often-cited statistics. But he puts them together in a misleading way. Let\u2019s take a look. The Facts For the purposes of this fact check, we will look at three numbers \u2014 35 percent, 44.6 percent and 22.5 percent \u2014 and how Ryan seamlessly stitched them together to make his case. Corporations are taxed at 35 percent, Ryan said. When it comes to small businesses, the tax burden is even steeper, he said. \u201cSmall businesses are taxed as high as 44.6 percent,\u201d he said. Then he asserted that the average rate in the \u201cindustrialized world\u201d was 22.5 percent. Although many other countries have changed their tax systems and slashed corporate tax rates in recent years, Ryan argues, the United States has fallen behind. A study on international tax policy from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released Wednesday confirms that corporate tax rates in other economic powers declined over the past decade. \u201cOverall, the number of countries with a statutory rate above 30 percent decreased from 21 in 2000 to 7 in 2008 and to 5 in 2016,\u201d the report found. Seems rather straightforward, right? Well, not so fast. 35 Percent Ryan\u2019s 35 percent corporate tax figure, which comes from the OECD, is the country\u2019s statutory rate \u2014 it is the rate in law only. Once state taxes are factored in, corporations can pay closer to 39 percent. However, the United States\u2019 effective tax rate, or what companies pay once all the deductions are included, is 18.6 percent. The OECD does not report effective rates, but in 2013 the Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the tax rates of another set of U.S. economic peers: the \u201cGroup of 20\u2033 countries. Update: An earlier version of this column failed to include a response from Ryan\u2019s office regarding statutory rates. \u201cEffective rates are irrelevant because that\u2019s just total taxes divided by total profits. What matters for the economy, investment decisions, and location decisions is the marginal rate \u2013 i.e., the rate on the next dollar of income earned. And the statutory rate is a useful measure of the marginal rate on the next investment decision, whereas the effective rate is not. For example, you could have a 90 percent statutory rate but hand out so many deductions and credits that the effective rate is 20 percent. But that means that the profits on a new investment will be taxed at 90 percent, and thus our tax system will not be competitive with other countries.\u201d 44.6 Percent And what about the small-business tax rate? A Ryan spokeswoman noted that PolitiFact Wisconsin marked this figure as true based on a 2013 news release by the House Ways and Means Committee. But this was not an actual report, merely \u201can analysis\u201d by the then-committee chairman, Dave Camp (R-Mich.), to pin the blame for higher taxes on Democrats. So it was not data from an independent research organization. Advertisement Politics aside, the 44.6 percent number is misleading. Ryan appears to understand this, as he carefully added the qualifier that the rate applied to \u201csuccessful small businesses.\u201d In other words, the 44.6 percent rate does not apply to all small businesses. Indeed, The Fact Checker previously reported that only 3 to 7.5 percent of small businesses pay the top rate. A 2013 study commissioned by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that the average effective tax rate for small businesses was 21.3 percent. 22.5 Percent Ryan\u2019s argument for slashing corporate taxes hinges on this one number. Based on his statistics, businesses in the rest of the industrialized world pay 12.5 percentage points less in taxes than businesses in America. Setting aside the fact that the numbers Ryan uses are statutory and not effective tax rates, the 22.5 percent figure is still misleading. Advertisement Ryan arrived at this number by calculating the straight average of the statutory tax rates for all the countries in the OECD. But a simple average treats all countries equally, so small countries like Iceland, Estonia and Luxembourg are weighted the same as economic powerhouses like the United States, Japan and Germany. That distorts the numbers. \u201cIf we are looking at the relative taxes for making investment decisions we want countries with larger economies where more investment is feasible to be weighted more heavily,\u201d Jane Gravelle, author of a 2014 report for the Congressional Research Service comparing international corporate tax rates, said in an email. In 2016, Iceland\u2019s gross domestic product, the broadest measure of a country\u2019s economy, was $17.2 billion, according to the OECD. That\u2019s minuscule compared with the United States\u2019 GDP of $18.6 trillion. Ryan\u2019s calculation weights Iceland, which has a 20 percent statutory corporate tax rate, the same as the United States \u2014 even though the U.S. economy is more than 1,000 times as large. (Note: an earlier version of this article incorrectly said 100 times.) Advertisement When weighted for GDP, according to the Tax Foundation, the average corporate rate in the OECD is 31.4 percent. For the G-20 countries, the weighed average is 31.3 percent; for the whole world, it is 29.5 percent. Ryan\u2019s office defended the statistic, saying the \u201cGDP doesn\u2019t determine where corporate profits are located.\u201d The Missing Statistics Ryan made a big fuss about corporate tax rates, but he did not mention individual income tax rates. Here\u2019s one possible reason: Many OECD countries have much higher rates for individual income taxes than the United States. The United States ranks 18 out of 34 OECD countries with a statutory personal income tax rate, which includes federal and state taxes, of 46.3 percent, and an \u201call-in\u201d rate of 48.6 percent when including Social Security. Sweden has the highest statutory rate, at 60.1 percent, and Portugal has the highest \u201call-in\u201d rate of 61.3 percent. Additionally, with respect to GDP, U.S. taxes are much lower than other in developed countries, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center. In 2014, revenue from all tax streams made up 26 percent of the U.S. GDP, compared with an average of 34 percent of GDP for the OECD countries. Denmark had the highest rate, with taxes at 50 percent of its GDP. Only three of the 34 member countries collect less taxes than the United States: South Korea, Chile and Mexico. The Pinocchio Test Ryan is very adept at citing what appear to be authoritative facts and figures. But just like watching a magician who disguises the cards hidden in his sleeve, Ryan\u2019s facts sometimes require careful scrutiny. Advertisement In this case, Ryan made his case with numbers that can be found in official statistics. But for the purposes of comparing tax systems across countries, two numbers \u2014 35 percent and 44.6 percent \u2014 are too high, and one number \u2014 22.5 percent \u2014 is too low. His 35 percent figure is the statutory rate, whereas the lower effective rate reflects the taxes that businesses actually pay. His 44.6 percent rate for small businesses is a number that more than 90 percent of small businesses do not pay; again, the effective rate is less than half the rate cited by Ryan. And Ryan\u2019s 22.5 percent figure is based on a simple average that assumes all countries are the same, whereas experts say a better measure takes the size of a country\u2019s economy into consideration. Ryan also somehow doesn\u2019t mention how most of the OECD countries with low corporate tax rates make up the difference with other forms of taxes. Advertisement We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. Many of the United States\u2019 economic competitors already have reduced their corporate rates. But Ryan ginned up his case for change in the United States in a misleading way. Two of his statistics are real numbers but used inappropriately. We were tempted to award a Three for Ryan\u2019s calculation of the average corporate rate for U.S. economic competitors. But again, that is not a made-up figure, just an inappropriate one.

        "doc": "Advertisment: About this rating Fashion label Balenciaga wasunder fire for controversial November 2022 campaigns, in which many accused the brand of condoning child sexual exploitation. One series of photographs from the campaign showed children posing with handbags shaped like teddy bears in bondage gear. Another photograph from a different campaign with the brand featured printed material that discussed child pornography laws. Weeks of controversy resulted in outraged internet users trying to pinpoint the alleged culprits behind the campaigns. One Twitter user claimed that a photograph of an individual in what appeared to be a red suit, clutching two baby dolls drenched in blood-colored red paint was actually Lotta Volkova, \"chief designer\" for Balenciaga. The tweet claimed that Balenciaga \"knew exactly what they were doing\" when they photographed and released the controversial campaigns. However, this picture did not feature Lotta Volkova. According to Getty Images, this is a 2016 photograph of an unnamed runway model showcasing designs from Chinese designer and performance artist Sheguang Hu's collection during the Mercedes-Benz China Fashion Week. Elsewhere, one can find actual photographs of Lotta Volkova, a stylist who has worked with the Paris-based Vetements collective and has consulted for Balenciaga, Jean Paul Gaultier, and others. Her work has been described as aiming for \"shock, awe and eccentricity,\" and her looks on the runway as \"part choir boy, part Lolita.\" Volkova also has walked runways in the past, as evidenced by these photographs of her modeling for Vetements, but the model pictured above for this story is not Volkova. Many accused Volkova of being behind the controversial Balenciaga campaigns, and nicknamed her a \"Satanic stylist\" for her Instagram content, which reportedly included scenes of violence and Satanic imagery. Her Instagram was made private as the accusations spread. But a spokesperson for Volkova told Newsweek that \"she condemns the abuse of children in any form,\" and added that she \"has not worked with Balenciaga or its team since 2017, and she has in no way participated in the brand's recent Instagram or advertising campaigns.\" Given that the picture above featured a model who is not Volkova, and Volkova herself denied being involved in the Balenciaga campaigns, we rate this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\" In another visual hoax circulating contemporaneously with the supposed Volkova photo, a well-traveled picture of a \"human skin jacket\" (actually made of latex and silicone) was overlaid with a Balenciaga logo to create the false impression that the company had made the product.",

        "claim": "Says Gov. Tony Evers gave $2.4 million in COVID relief money to Planned Parenthood affiliates throughout Wisconsin \u201cto bail them out and fund abortions.\"",
        "doc": "There are lots of things Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who\u2019s running to unseat Evers this fall, don\u2019t agree on. One big one: How to treat Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the state\u2019s largest reproductive health care provider. Kleefisch, a Republican who opposes abortion, supported legislation under former Gov. Scott Walker that cut funding for Planned Parenthood in 2016. She\u2019s touted that on the campaign trail as recently as last month. Evers, a Democrat who backs abortion rights, campaigned on restoring funding to the organization, but has been stifled in his attempts to do so by the Republican-controlled Legislature. He did, however, allocate a small portion of federal COVID-19 relief dollars to Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the state, which Kleefisch latched onto in a March 9 campaign email. \"Tony Evers was caught giving $2.4 MILLION of our state\u2019s federal COVID relief funds in grants to Planned Parenthood affiliates throughout Wisconsin to bail them out and fund abortions,\" the email reads. A quick search of the state Department of Administration\u2019s list of grantees shows those funds were indeed awarded to Planned Parenthood clinics. But Kleefisch\u2019s purported reason why Evers allocated the money is where her argument goes awry. Let\u2019s take a look. When asked for evidence to back up the claim, Kleefisch\u2019s communications director Alec Zimmerman sent two documents from the Department of Administration that list grant awards to Planned Parenthood. The first grants were among those distributed to nonprofit organizations that provided \"critical services to individuals in the areas of health care, housing and shelter, adult education\" and other services, according to a Nov. 3, 2020, news release from Evers\u2019 office announcing the grant program. Evers directed $10 million of the state\u2019s money from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act toward the grant program. Twenty-one Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin clinic locations received grants that added up to $1.4 million. Those included Appleton, Blair, Delavan, Eau Claire, Green Bay, Kenosha, La Crosse, Manitowoc, Oshkosh, Portage, Racine, Sparta, Waukesha, West Allis, West Bend and Wisconsin Rapids, as well as the Madison South clinic and Milwaukee\u2019s Capitol, Mitchell Street, Northwest and Wisconsin Avenue locations. Evers also awarded a $1 million grant to Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin on Feb. 8 as part of his Equitable Grant Recovery Program, aimed at supporting organizations that work to eliminate disparities in health, child development, education and other areas. A grant announcement from the Department of Administration said up to $82 million in grants may be given for those purposes. This grant program, too, is using COVID-19 relief dollars \u2014 this time from the federal American Rescue Plan Act. So Kleefisch is right that Evers sent $2.4 million in grant money to Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin \u2014 though we\u2019ll note he wasn\u2019t \"caught\" doing it. Recipients were posted on a government web site. Her claim veers off track in the second half: Did Evers give the money to Planned Parenthood specifically to \"bail them out and fund abortions?\" \"The \u2018bail out\u2019 language was obviously general but it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Walker/Kleefisch Administration stripped Planned Parenthood of its state funding so you have to wonder if the move to give them grants was intentional,\" Zimmerman wrote in an email. That\u2019s conjecture, not evidence. And, as noted, Planned Parenthood is a major provider of heath-care services. Abortion services make up a small share of the organization\u2019s overall services \u2014 3% in 2019, according to the latest annual national report. And in Wisconsin, only three clinics can provide them. That\u2019s the Madison East location, Milwaukee\u2019s Water Street Health Center and the Sheboygan clinic. None of those clinics got money from the nonprofit grant program. Mike Murray, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said in an email that neither pot of funding would be used to fund abortion services as Kleefisch claimed. All CARES Act money is explicitly prohibited from being used for abortions under the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal dollars from being used for that purpose in most cases. The American Rescue Plan Act funds aren\u2019t restricted by Hyde, but in this case still are not being directed toward abortions. The CARES Act dollars went toward family planning services, treatment and testing for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, Murray said. The American Rescue Plan Act funding will support \"investments to reduce health inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.\" Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin does, of course, provide abortion services. But Kleefisch didn\u2019t say Evers gave money to an organization that performs those services. She said he gave them the money specifically to fund abortions. That\u2019s off the mark. Kleefisch claimed Evers gave Planned Parenthood affiliates in Wisconsin $2.4 million in federal COVID relief money \"to bail them out and fund abortions.\" Evers did give them grants funds, but they\u2019re not being used to pay for abortions. Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.",

After all, the New York Times headlined its article on the 2019 budget: \u201cWhite House Proposes $4.4 Trillion Budget That Adds $7 Trillion to Deficits.\u201d So how does a budget that adds $7 trillion to the deficit actually reduce the deficit by $3 trillion? Advertisement Magic budget math! We originally intended to ignore the budget, which was largely made irrelevant by the congressional budget deal reached a week earlier. But this kind of spin simply cannot be ignored \u2014 and if we were confused, we imagine our readers were confused as well. The Facts There is a standard table in every federal budget labeled S-2. This is where an administration tallies the 10-year deficit impact of its various proposals on the budget, measured against a baseline of spending and revenue if nothing had been changed. In other words, it is a wish list, with few items ever enacted. Item No. 1 this year: Repeal and replace Obamacare, resulting in savings of $675 billion over 10 years. We all know how well that effort fared in 2017. It has no chance in an election year. The S-2 table in the 2019 budget actually tallies up to $3.631 trillion worth of spending cuts. But if you remove the interest on debt saved from these proposals, it\u2019s really $3.312 trillion. White House officials said they reduced it further, to $3 trillion, in public statements to reflect the spending deal reached with Congress the week before. Advertisement In other words, already the wish list is out of date. The budget, for instance, calls for slashing $1.5 trillion over 10 years from nondefense discretionary spending, starting with an $84 billion cut in the next two years, through a \u201ctwopenny plan\u201d that would cut such spending two percentage points a year. But Congress decided to bust through the sequester caps and add $128 billion to domestic programs for the next two years. So the budget is $212 billion behind on that item. There\u2019s no way President Trump will ever catch up. Moreover, some items on the list, such as phasing down funding for overseas contingency operations and disaster spending, probably were going to happen anyway. Just those two items add up to $808 billion over 10 years, or 25 percent of the claimed savings. White House officials defended the statement. \u201cThis budget represents the second largest reduction in deficits from the baseline ever \u2014 the largest being President Trump\u2019s budget last year,\u201d said John Czwartacki, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. Advertisement This proves our point. Trump had a wish list in 2018, with a big number, and virtually none of it happened. In the previous year, there was a similar list that included such as ideas as repeal and replace Obamacare ($250 billion in savings) and the twopenny plan ($1.4 trillion). A big item on the 2018 list \u2014 reform Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance program ($616 billion) \u2014 does not even make a repeat appearance. As regular readers know, we often say that raw numbers are misleading. When measured against the predicted size of the gross domestic product, this year\u2019s proposals result in less claimed deficit reduction than in 2018, 2017 and 2013. In fact, in going through the S-2 tables of 10 years of budgets, we found that Obama in 2017 offered proposals that were estimated to produce bigger deficit savings in raw dollars \u2014 $3.640 trillion \u2014 than Trump is claiming this year. Obama exceeded Trump\u2019s number by $9 billion \u2014 yes, a rounding error \u2014 but it calls into question the statement we originally got from OMB. Advertisement An OMB official said Czwartacki misspoke and noted that Mulvaney had referred to \u201cthe second largest proposed reduction in spending ever,\u201d not overall deficit reduction. (Obama\u2019s proposals included tax increases.) Not to get too granular, but since officials are already conceding that the savings in the 2019 budget are really $3 trillion, not $3.631 trillion, it\u2019s actually smaller than the $3.563 trillion claimed in the 2018 budget. So Mulvaney continues to be wrong. The Pinocchio Test This charade reminds us of the story of the man who claimed he had sold a dog for $50,000. How did he do that? He traded the dog for two $25,000 cats. In other words, the numbers add up but they are meaningless. White House officials are congratulating themselves for concocting a wish list of spending cuts that will never be enacted. The numbers look big over a 10-year horizon, but already they are out of date. Meanwhile, the fiscal position of the United States slipped in the past year because of a bonanza of tax cuts and spending increases. Moreover, even if one accepted the figures, it\u2019s not the largest such estimate as officials claim. Advertisement We wavered over whether these statements were worthy of Three or Four Pinocchios. These are numbers in a government document, after all. But what tipped us to Four Pinocchios was that these claims were made in service of a budget plan that allows for soaring deficits, even after adopting economic growth far outside the economic mainstream. That\u2019s more than spin \u2014 it\u2019s spin that\u2019s whistling past the graveyard.

        "doc": "This post was shared more than 16,000 times in the first 13 hours after being published on January 2. Its caption translates to: \u201cNew update. Seven containers from China containing ballots that had been cast for the ballot number one candidate have been discovered in Tanjung Priok port. Each of the containers contains 10 million ballots. So the total is 70 million casted ballots. The containers have been confiscated by Indonesian Navy officials and have been sent to the general election commission.\u201d Tanjung Priok is a port in Indonesia\u2019s capital of Jakarta. Indonesia will hold a presidential election in April this year, which pits Widodo against his sole rival, Prabowo Subianto. Widodo is officially number one on the ballot, according to the election commission\u2019s website. The post features an image of a blue container with the watermark of Waspada.co.id -- an online news outlet based in Medan, capital of Indonesia\u2019s North Sumatra province. This other post, which was shared more than 11,000 times in the first 15 hours after being posted on January 2, made a similar claim, although with different illustrations. The false claims have appeared elsewhere online, including these reports here and here. Reverse image searches found that the photos used in both of the false posts above were taken from earlier media reports. The photo used in the first Facebook post was taken from this Waspada.co.id articled dated November 16, 2018, about the distribution of ballots for the coming election in North Sumatra province. Below is a screenshot of the Waspada article. Three images shared by the second post were sourced from various news reports about the 2017 elections for Jakarta\u2019s governorship. The links to the three articles are here, here and here. Below are the snapshots of those articles. The final image of the green boxes of paper was taken from an illustration of a stationery business advertisement posted in a local online marketplace. Below is a snapshot of that advertisement. Indonesian general elections commission (KPU) chairman Arif Budiman visited Tanjung Priok late on January 2 in response to the false claims and inspect the port. In a press briefing held after the operation and broadcast by local station Kompas TV, Budiman dismissed the claims. Below is Kompas\u2019s Youtube broadcast of the press briefing. At minute 48:12 of the clip, Budiman says: \u201cToday we can confirm that, based on what we have been told by customs and excises officials, there is no information about the discovery of the claimed seven containers. That\u2019s not true. It is also false that the containers were found by Indonesian Navy officials and have been sent to KPU.\u201d",

        "claim": "Photo of a retired colonel from Lucknow who shot himself in distress as one of his sons couldn\u2019t even attend the last rites of his mother",
        "doc": "An image of dead bodies of an elderly couple placed on the pyre is being widely shared on social media claiming that the man was a retired colonel residing in Lucknow and he shot himself as his sons were unconcerned with parents\u2019 lives. Let\u2019s fact check the claim made in the post. Claim: Photo of a retired colonel from Lucknow who shot himself in distress as one of his sons couldn\u2019t even attend the last rites of his mother. Fact: This photo does not show any retired colonel from Lucknow who shot himself in distress. The same story has been going viral with different images over the last few years. There are no news reports of the suicide of a retired Colonel for the reasons mentioned. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE. Had there been a suicide of a retired Colonel, the media would have covered it widely. So, we searched for national and local news reports regarding this incident in English and Hindi languages but couldn\u2019t find any. We then ran a reverse image search of the viral photo and found that the same photo has been viral since 2018 with different stories. One such post from 2018 can be seen here. The accompanying description says, \u201cPorsa\u2019s Panditji died yesterday evening. When he was being taken for funeral this morning, his wife also sacrificed her life\u201d. We found that Porsa is a town in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh. Also, the same story as in the viral post has been shared at least since 2019 with various other images. Some of them can be seen here and here Though we couldn\u2019t independently verify the identities of the deceased couple shown in the viral photo, a report by AajTak states that the couple seen in the viral pic was Chhotelal Sharma (90) and his wife Gangadevi (87) of Puranakhedi, Madhya Pradesh. Chhotelal was a farmer and not a Colonel. The couple had 4 sons and 6 daughters. When Chhotelal died at around 4 am on 03 september 2018, his wife couldn\u2019t bear the shock and died the same evening. Both were cremated on the same pyre. To sum it up, a fictional story linked with an old unrelated photo is being shared as a retired Colonel\u2019s suicide in Lucknow.",

Fact-check: Incident from 2018 Many people responded to Mir\u2019s tweet claimed that it is an old incident. Alt News searched for news reports of all reported \u2018human shield\u2019 incidents in the past, and came across articles in Scroll and Times of India which refer to the same video shared by Mir. Both the articles were published in June 2018 and claim that the said incident happened on June 18, 2018 and the video was reportedly shot at Samboora village in South Kashmir\u2019s Pulwama district. According to the report by Scroll, Sanjay Sharma, a commandant of the Central Reserve Police Force, stated that none of their personnel were seen in the video. The Army also did not respond to Scroll\u2019s queries, stating that they\u2019re ascertaining facts. However, Scroll spoke with some of the men who were used as human shields and they stated that the security forces took four men from their homes and used them as human shields. Thus, an alleged incident from 2018 of security forces using human shields was projected as a recent incident. Mir has shared misleading videos several times in the past and refrained from deleting them even after being pointed out (1, 2). Donate to Alt News!

In fact, it\u2019s similar to rules already in effect in other places. We saw the claim on Facebook, Twitter, and a segment on the news channel Sky News Australia, each sounding the alarm about an alleged future in which people are not allowed to leave their zone without express permission, all in the name of protecting the environment. \"Oxfordshire County Council Pass Climate Lockdown \u2018trial\u2019 to Begin in 2024,\" reads what looks like a Vision News headline in a screenshot shared on Facebook. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The original Vision News article is from Nov. 30. It reads, \"Oxfordshire County Council yesterday approved plans to lock residents into one of six zones to 'save the planet' from global warming. The latest stage in the '15 minute city' agenda is to place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, confining residents to their own neighbourhoods.\" Oxfordshire County, between London and Birmingham, England, is home to Oxford University. It\u2019s mostly rural, but there are some urban, high-traffic areas. The Oxfordshire County Council decided to install six traffic filters on a trial basis, according to information available on its website. A traffic filter, in this case, is a system of cameras that takes pictures of car license plates and fines the owners if they break certain rules. Anyone traveling via taxi, bike, bus, or walking is exempt. Residents can apply for permits to go through the traffic filters in a private car. The filters are not roadblocks, and there are many exceptions for people to pass them. They are not in effect from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., they do not apply to bus drivers and disabled drivers, and residents can apply for 100 day permits for their private vehicles per year, according to a fact-check by AP. \"Even if you don\u2019t have a permit, [you] will still be able to drive everywhere,\" a spokesperson for the Oxfordshire government told PolitiFact in an email. \"You might just need to use a different route or drive through the ring road to avoid the traffic filters.\" According to the Oxfordshire County Council\u2019s climate assessment of the plan, there is hope that the filters will reduce driving, and therefore reduce climate change.Other cities have participated in similar projects. For example, New York City\u2019s Open Streets program involves putting up temporary physical barriers for all large vehicles, prioritizing pedestrians, bicyclists and local vehicles on small stretches of streets. A Facebook post claimed that the Oxfordshire County Council has passed a \"climate lockdown\" trial \"confining residents to their neighbourhoods.\" A trial run of a traffic filter program in Oxfordshire County is focused on mitigating traffic congestion and making spaces more walkable and bikeable. While the program would increase restrictions on private vehicles driving certain roads during the day, traffic restrictions in general are not unique to this program. It does not amount to a \u2018lockdown.\u2019 We rate this claim False. PolitiFact contributor Madison Czopek contributed to this report.",

        "claim": "Five Wisconsin cities received money for the 2020 election from Mark Zuckerberg, which amounted to \"a wave of massive election bribery.\"",
        "doc": "Michael Gableman, the former state Supreme Court justice overseeing a Republican-ordered, taxpayer-funded review of Wisconsin\u2019s long-settled 2020 election, has made many factually-challenged statements. But one in particular caught our attention during his March 7, 2022 appearance on Fox News\u2019 \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" It came in this tangle of a response to a request from Carlson to give an overview of his findings: \"We had a wave of massive election bribery, in which government officials in the five Zuckerberg-sponsored cities participated, as well as what you related when you introduced your audience (to) me, which is the government sponsored elder abuse, all to wring out votes from people who frankly were victimized by the very people at the Wisconsin Elections Commission who are supposed to keep our voters safe.\" There\u2019s a lot going on there \u2013 and there was a lot in the rest of the interview. But this is the claim we are pulling out: That five Wisconsin cities received money for the 2020 election from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which amounted to \"a wave of massive election bribery.\" The appearance came soon after Gableman gave an update on his review to a state Assembly committee on March 1, 2022. Although a judge found little evidence of work having been done, Gableman has been given more time by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, to complete his work \u2013 which originally was to be done in October. Is Gableman, a former member of the state\u2019s top court, right about a \"massive wave of bribery\"? According to multiple court rulings: No. Indeed, he is ridiculously wrong. Let\u2019s start with a little background: First, recounts and the courts have repeatedly confirmed that Democrat Joe Biden defeated Republican Donald Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in 2020 in Wisconsin. A legislative audit and study by a conservative group found no signs of significant voter fraud. Nevertheless, Vos \u2013 who has publicly stated Wisconsin\u2019s electoral votes cannot be rescinded \u2013 named Gableman as special counsel and gave him a taxpayer-funded budget of $676,000 to complete a review. Vos and Gableman reached a new agreement March 8, 2022, that extends his work until at least April. On March 1, 2022, Gableman issued a wide-ranging report to an Assembly committee that included this claim: \"The Center for Tech and Civic Life\u2019s $8,800,000 Zuckerberg Plan Grant with the Cities of Milwaukee, Madison, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay (the Zuckerberg 5 Cities) violates Wisconsin law prohibiting election bribery.\" Those grants are what Gableman was referring to on the Carlson show. And that\u2019s what Gableman\u2019s staff pointed us to when we asked for backup to the claim. The Center for Tech and Civic Life, a national nonprofit organization, used $350 million in donations from Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to issue grants aimed at helping local governments conduct safe elections during the COVID pandemic. The group told PolitiFact Wisconsin it issued nearly 2,500 grants nationwide and that every eligible office that applied received at least some money. More than half went to election offices that serve less than 25,000 registered voters. The money arrived as local election budgets were drained by spending on election workers, postage and printing for the increasing number of voters who wanted to vote by mail. All told, $10 million in grants went to more than 200 communities across Wisconsin, including many in Republican areas. So, Gableman is wrong to suggest the money went only to five. He and Republicans have trained their fire \u2013 and ire \u2013 on the $8.8 million that went to the state's five largest cities, which are home to many Democratic voters. That\u2019s about 90 percent of the total distributed in the state. More importantly, the grants have been upheld by the courts. \"As former state Supreme Court Justice, Michael Gableman should know better than anyone that these baseless claims of \u2018bribery\u2019 were heard before the election and were rejected in court multiple times,\" the center said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. In one of the many lawsuits, U.S. District Judge William Griesbach, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican, refused to block the grant money, saying there was nothing in state law \"that can be fairly construed as prohibiting the defendant Cities from accepting funds from CTCL.\" Later, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on an appeal of that case that those who brought the lawsuit failed to identify any laws that would prohibit the grants. Gableman has argued that various communities are the recipients of the \"bribe,\" never mind that he only focuses on five communities \u2013 and not the 195-plus more that received the same money. In his view, what Zuckerberg got for the \"bribe\" is the president he wanted. But it\u2019s unclear why he would have then given the money to communities poised to deliver votes to Donald Trump, or have spent money in states where the outcome was never in doubt, instead of just swing states like Wisconsin. Gableman said five Wisconsin cities received money for the 2020 election from Mark Zuckerberg, which amounted to \"a wave of massive election bribery.\" But far more than five cities received the money. Gableman is ignoring ones in largely Republican areas. And courts have repeatedly upheld the grants as lawful, not bribery \u2013 much less a \"massive wave\" of bribery. As a former state Supreme Court justice, that\u2019s a point Gableman should be familiar with. That makes the claim ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",

In the 1950s, the CDC was named the Communicable Disease Center and focused on communicable diseases. Non-communicable diseases, such as cancer and related risk factors, were addressed by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), the precursor to the current Department of Health and Human Services. \"As noted in the 2000 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, several activities by then Surgeon General, Dr. Leroy Burney, who reported to the Director of HEW, reinforced the U.S. Government's stance on the growing scientific association between smoking and cancer,\" the spokesperson said in an email on July 30, 2020. \"Specifically, the report notes: 'The Surgeon General first brought the Public Health Service into the scene by establishing a scientific study group in 1956 to appraise the effects of smoking on health. The study group determined that there was a causal relationship between excessive smoking of cigarettes and lung cancer. Surgeon General Leroy E. Burney issued a statement in 1957 that 'the weight of the evidence is increasingly pointing in one direction: that excessive smoking is one of the causative factors in lung cancer.'\" A screenshot of the 2000 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, taken on July 30, 2020, with the relevant section highlighted by AFP.

        "claim": "Donald Trump was never accused of racism before he ran for president in 2016.",
        "doc": "A meme featuring several images of Donald Trump posing with prominentAfrican-Americans was widely circulated on Facebook in May 2016, along with the claim that the real estate mogul was \u201cnever once accused of being racist by anyone\u201d until he entered the 2016 presidential campaign as a Republican \u2014 implying that Trump was falsely being accused of racism by opponents purely for the purpose of scoring political points: However,Donald Trump wasaccused of racism long before he announced that he was running for president.According to theNew York Times, one of Trump\u2019s first newspaper appearances wasin 1973, when the Trump Management Corporation was sued by the Department of Justice and chargedfor violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968: \u201cThe government contended that Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals \u2018because of race and color,\u2019\u200a\u201d The Times reported. \u201cIt also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available.\u201d Trump was also accused of racism in 1989, when he took out full page ads calling for the return of the death penalty in several New York City newspapers. The ads were published a few weeks after a 28-year-old woman was raped while jogging in Central Park. Five men were arrested for the attack: \u201cThey should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. I want to hate these murderers and I always will.\u201d The incident stirred racial tensions in the city, with many accusing Trump of adding fuel to the fire.When evidence surfaced in 2002 that wouldeventually lead to the exoneration ofthe five men who were charged with rape, protesters criticized Trump for his racially charged rhetoric: On May 1, 1989, Donald J. Trump took out full-page advertisements in four New York newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty. Mr. Trump said he wanted the \u201dcriminals of every age\u201d who were accused of beating and raping a jogger in Central Park 12 days earlier \u201dto be afraid.\u201d Thirteen years later, as new evidence raises the possibility that the five teenagers convicted in the attack had nothing to do with it, their supporters are focusing some of their fiercest anger at Mr. Trump. \u201cTrump is a chump!\u201d protesters shouted during a recent demonstration, accusing Mr. Trump of, at least, further inflaming passions and perhaps tainting the defendants\u2019 future jurors. Some called him a racist. Supporters of the Central Park defendants have demanded an apology. Former employees of Donald Trump also accused the real estate mogul of racism back in the 1990s. John R. O\u2019Donnell,the one-time president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino,wrotein his1991 bookTrumped! that his former employer frequently used racial slurs: A book written by one of Donald Trump\u2019s former casino executives accuses Trump of calling his biggest gamblers \u201cslobs,\u201d of making racial slurs against black people and of being largely ignorant about the casino business. O\u2019Donnell described a dinner conversation with Trump in which, he writes, they discussed Trump Plaza\u2019s financial executive, who was black. He quoted Trump as saying he never liked the man and believed he was not doing a good job. Trump\u2019s conversation is recounted: \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it funny. I\u2019ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy. And it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d The real estate mogul was also accused of making racist remarks when he testified before the House Native American Affairs Subcommittee in 1993: \u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians to me and they don\u2019t look like Indians to Indians,\u201d said Donald Trump in words which led to immediate accusations of racism and bigotry. Mr Trump was attacking the tiny tribe of Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Connecticut whose casino, with profits of $1 million dollars a day, has just outgrown his own casinos in Atlantic City to become the largest in the United States. He said: \u2018It will be the biggest scandal since Al Capone and it will destroy the gambling industry\u2019 if the Pequots and members of the 515 other Indian tribes in the US continue to exploit their status as sovereign nations to start casino gambling. Mr Trump, speaking to a Congressional committee, added: \u2018It\u2019s obvious that organised crime is rampant on the Indian reservations.\u2019 The FBI immediately denied that it had any evidence that the mob was moving into gambling on the reservations. In Connecticut the Governor, Lowell Weicker, who signed the deal whereby the Pequots give $113 million a year to his state, sprang to the tribe\u2019s defence earlier this month, saying he objected more to Mr Trump than he did to casinos. In a rich exchange of insults he said he had come to a \u2018fast conclusion that we don\u2019t need that dirtbag in Connecticut\u2019. Mr Trump, denying he had meant to cast a slur on American Indians, said the Governor was \u2018a fat slob who couldn\u2019t get elected dog-catcher in Connecticut\u2019. Mr Weicker admitted that he might have been a little tough in his language but then added: \u2018I can lose weight a lot faster than a bigot can lose bigotry.\u2019 In 1992, Trump lost an appeal to overturn a $200,000 penalty for removing black dealers from gaming tables at the request of high rollers, and in 1996 twenty African-Americans in Indiana sued Trump, accusing him of reneging on a promise that he would hire largely minorities for hisriverboat casino staff. This isn\u2019t a comprehensive list of all the times Donald Trump has been tied to racially charged incidents, nor is it proof that Donald Trump currently harbors racistideals. The viral meme which circulated in May 2016 claimed that Trump had never been accused of racism before he decided to run against Democrats, and that claim is blatantly false. Trump has been accused of racism by former employees, protesters, committee members, and he has also been the subject of legal action involving anti-discrimination laws.",

And I\u2019ll say, how are you doing? \u2018Oh, don\u2019t know, don\u2019t know, not well, Mr. President, not well.\u2019 I said, well, what\u2019s the problem? \u2018Oh, GDP 9 percent, not well.\u2019 And I\u2019m saying to myself, here we are at like 1 percent, dying, and they\u2019re at 9 percent and they\u2019re unhappy. So, you know, and these are like countries, you know, fairly large, like 300 million people.\u201d \u2014 Trump, remarks during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, July 25 Advertisement The gross domestic product, or GDP, is the broadest measure of a nation\u2019s economy. But since the Great Recession ended in 2010, the U.S. GDP has only grown between 1.6 percent and 2.6 percent on an annual basis. While this growth rate puts the United States on a par with developed nations like Canada and Britain, President Trump thinks the United States could be doing better. He believes the United States should be able to reach upwards of 4 or 5 percent growth, though most economists believe that is unrealistic on a sustainable basis. (The United States last topped 4 percent GDP growth in 2000.) To help spur this boom in the U.S. economy, Trump is pressing to overhaul the U.S tax code by cutting tax rates and eliminating complex tax rules. When he talks about his tax plan, that\u2019s when the president enviously highlights the GDP growth of other countries. On several occasions, Trump anonymously quoted heads of state who he claims are unsatisfied with GDP growth of 7-to-9 percent \u2013more than five times the United States\u2019 2016 rate of 1.6 percent. Advertisement Trump certainly speaks with foreign leaders on a regular basis, but very few countries have 7-to-9 percent GDP growth. We wanted to know: Who could he be quoting? Let\u2019s check the records. The Facts On July 25, Trump sat down with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editor-in-chief Gerard Baker. During the interview, according to an unedited transcript obtained by Politico, Baker asked Trump what he thought was a reasonable corporate tax rate. Trump responded that he was \u201casking for 15 percent,\u201d before recounting an exchange about GDP growth he\u2019s had with several leaders of \u201cmajor \u2013 major countries.\u201d Trump claims that these unnamed heads of state lament GDP growth of 9 percent while the United States sees only \u201c1 percent\u201d growth each year. On Sept. 6, during a speech in North Dakota outlining the need for a new tax plan, Trump repeated the claim, almost verbatim, adding that he spoke \u201crecently\u201d with two leaders who were unhappy to report 7 and 9 percent GDP growth. Advertisement In both cases, Trump did not name the foreign leaders. During his interview with the WSJ, he did mention Malaysia, Indonesia and China as countries with large populations and high growth. In 2016, Malaysia, (population 30.1 million) saw a 4.2 percent increase in GDP, according to the World Bank. Indonesia\u2019s GDP grew 5 percent in 2016. And China\u2019s GDP increased 6.7 percent. While Trump did not name the leaders, he did offer a few clues as to who he might have spoken to: He said the countries are \u201cmajor, major\u201d and they are \u201cbig, big\u201d or \u201cfairly large, like 300 million people.\u201d We pored through the White House Press Office\u2019s log of the foreign leaders Trump has met with, or spoken to since taking office. Trump has spoken to 58 heads of state between Sept. 9 and Jan. 28, according to the White House records. Of these 58 countries only three had a 2016 GDP growth rate of roughly 7 percent or more: Iraq, India and the Philippines. Advertisement Could the mystery callers be Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, or Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi? Here is a timeline of his meetings with each leader: In 2016, the Philippines\u2019 GDP grew by 6.9 percent, India saw a 7.1 percent increase, and Iraq had the largest increase of 11 percent. When Trump sat down with the WSJ in July, he had already spoken with all three leaders. While all of the countries have a GDP growth rate well above the United States, none can claim a 9 percent increase. This fact leaves us scratching our heads, and wondering, who is the president quoting? At best, Trump is mis-remembering the conversations, and at worst, he is making up the facts. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for information. By September, Trump changed his claim slightly to include a leader who was unhappy to report 7 percent GDP growth. Advertisement Several signs point to India\u2019s prime minister as that unhappy head of state. First, India\u2019s population is 1.3 billion, which qualifies the country as \u201cbig big.\u201d Second, Modi and Trump spoke last in August, and Trump described the call as recent. Third, Trump and Modi share a similar \u201cmy-country-first\u201d economic agenda. When Modi visited the White House on June 26, Trump praised Modi for making the largest tax cut in India\u2019s history. Fourth, and most importantly, India routinely sees a higher GDP growth rate: 8 percent in 2015, 7.5 percent in 2014, and 6.3 percent in 2013. \u201cIndia has the fastest-growing economy in the world,\u201d Trump exclaimed with Modi at his side. \u201cWe hope we\u2019ll be catching you very soon in terms of percentage increase\u2014I have to tell you, we\u2019re working on it!\u201d Here\u2019s the catch: comparing the United States economic growth to India\u2019s is like comparing apples to oranges. Advertisement India is an emerging economy. An emerging economy is defined by rapid economic growth due to technological improvements, growing workforces, major capital investments, and changes in political and social practices. These countries are not as wealthy as the United States or Canada, but are trying to catch up. India\u2019s emerging economy explains why India\u2019s GDP percentage growth tops the United States\u2019 year after year. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy organization, says it is much harder to make rapid economic gains in countries that have already experience a period of major investment. Instead, countries like the United States \u201care doing the hard work of keeping the economy churning along,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research and policy institute, shares Holtz-Eakin\u2019s analysis. Bernstein adds that Trump\u2019s assertion that the United States can match India by issuing major tax cuts is \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Bernstein attributes India\u2019s growth to several factors, including a younger and growing labor force. In contrast, the United States has a shrinking and aging labor force. Advertisement \u201cAs long as I\u2019ve been looking at the numbers, China and India have always grown faster than the U.S.,\u201d said Bernstein, an economic adviser to Vice President Biden during the Obama administration. \u201cThey are more volatile. They might fall faster as well,\u201d he said. Since meeting with Trump, Modi learned that India has hit an economic rough-patch. From April to June, India\u2019s growth slumped to 5.7, the lowest in three years, according to numbers released in September. Economists point to a decline in manufacturing growth, a sector Modi pledged to revitalize, as a key cause for the slump. Manufacturing growth bottomed out at 1.2 percent, from 10.7 percent during the same period a year ago. The Pinocchio Test By a process of elimination, it is possible the prime minister of India is the world leader who is unhappy with 7 percent growth rate. (He\u2019s probably even unhappier now that growth appears to be slowing.) Certainly, Trump has expressed interest in rivaling India\u2019s growth. Advertisement That\u2019s one world leader. But the world leader who Trump claims is unhappy with 9 percent growth appears to be a phantom. Of the 58 heads of state he\u2019s met or spoke with since taking office, not one can claim 9 percent GDP growth. Perhaps Trump misheard. Or perhaps the other leader was fibbing. Or maybe Trump just thought the pitch for a tax cut sounded better if he could quote two leaders. In any case, Trump is making a major economic error in comparing the GDP of a developed country to a developing one.

According to PRI report, members of Monty Python hoped to shoot the film across a variety of castles in Scotland. But due to a last-minute mix-up, they only received permission to shoot at Doune, where they ended up filming the majority of castle scenes. This led to the crew\u2019s being rather creative with their camera angles, passing off the one castle as the scene of multiple locations. Doune was used as the location for Castle Anthrax, Camelot, and Swamp Castle in the film. For decades afterward, the castle became the site of annual pilgrimages by Monty Python fans, and starting in 2004 the area even celebrated a Monty Python Day, where fans took tours of the castle and watched actors recreate scenes. However, a small number of scenes were also shot at Castle Stalker, also in Scotland. In the film it was known as Castle Aaargh.

In fact, we have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years, and his name has been on the ballot one time.\"\"Wow,\" Maddow responded.Randolph's claim about a future House speaker surprised Maddow, which means it's something we wanted to check.The man in line to be speaker four years from now is Rep. Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary. But when we reached Randolph's office, he said he was talking about Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, who will be speaker for the 2013 and 2014 legislative sessions.To make sure Randolph wasn't moving the goal posts on us, we decided to check both.Dorworth represents District 34, which includes parts of Orange and Seminole counties. As of 2000, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the district by about 14 percentage points. Dorworth was first elected to the seat in 2007 during a special election to replace David Mealor. He was re-elected in 2008 and 2010.According to Department of State election records, Dorworth won a close primary in 2007 against Allen Roosa, winning by 68 votes. Dorworth then won the 2007 general election against a Democrat and two no-party candidates, receiving 54.5 percent of the vote. In 2008, Dorworth easily dispatcheda primary challenger and did not have an opponent in the general election, meaning he was re-elected after the primary.In 2010, Dorworth did not have a primary, but he did beat Democrat Steve Barnes and John DeVries, a tea party candidate.That's two general elections out of a possible three, and two primaries out of three, where his name appeared on the ballot.As for Weatherford, the person Randolph says he was talking about, things get a little more complicated.A one-time aide to former Speaker Alan Bense who married Bense's daughter, Weatherford was first elected in District 61 in 2006. The district covers Pasco and Hillsborough counties, and as of 2000, registered voters in the district were 41 percent Republican and 40 percent Democrat.In 2006, Weatherford's name didn't appear on the ballot.That year, Republican Party officials selected Weatherford to replace incumbent Rep. Ken Littlefield on the general election ballot after Littlefield decided to take a position on the Public Service Commission. But the change happened too close to the election, and Littlefield's name remained in place. So votes for Littlefield actually went to Weatherford. Littlefield/Weatherford defeated Democrat Donovan Brown, receiving 60 percent of the vote.Weatherford was then re-elected without any opposition in 2008 -- not a primary or a general election.In 2010, he handily defeated newcomer Kevin Wright in a primary, and his name appeared on the November ballot where he bested Democrat Elena McCullough and received almost 66 percent of the vote.Weatherford's story is a bit trickier to judge in the context of Randolph's claim. Weatherford has run in two general elections -- though only once was his name on the ballot. He also had a primary in 2010, though Randolph's comments pertained to thelarger point about redistricting and the split between Republicans and Democrats. That would put greater weight on general elections.Where does this all leave us?Randolph said: \"We have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years and his name has been on the ballot one time.\" A basic reading of Randolph's comments would lead you to believe he's talking about Dorworth, who is scheduled to be speaker in 2015 -- four years from now. Dorworth has had two general elections out of a possible three, plus two primaries.But Randolph said he was talking about Weatherford, who is set to replace Rep. Dean Cannon as speaker for2013 and 2014. Weatherford's name has only appeared on the general electionballot once -- but even granting Randolph wide latitude, he's still reshaping history. Weatherford was appointed to replace Littlefield on the 2006 ballot for District 61, and even though Weatherford's name wasn't on the ballot, he still spent about six weeks campaigning for the seat.If he had gotten the years right, Randolph might have had a better case. But because of the misstatement, coupled with the fact that Weatherford's story is not as clear-cut as Randolph described it, we find this claim False.",

        "claim": "\"Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market.\"",
        "doc": "UPDATE, 12:50 p.m., May 6, 2016: Months after this fact check posted, the Austin American-Statesman obtained Austin Police Department statistics that conflict with the numbers the agency provided us when we conducted the check. The updated figures, which suggest more than 80 previously untallied DWI collisions in 2014 and 2015, would change our calculations in the fact check below, resulting, for instance, in 12 percent fewer DWI collisions in 2014 compared with 2013, not 24 percent fewer. That said, we\u2019re not changing our story or adjusting the original Truth-O-Meter rating. The new data were not available to Uber at the time the company aired its claim, which was based on a news report that also used data the police department provided.Uber, a prominent ride-sharing service, has urged Austin-area supporters to tell Austin City Council members not to limit how it does business in part, it says, because drunken-driving accidents declined after such services started locally. \"Ridesharing is moving Austin forward,\" Uber says in a web post including a petition for council members that we spotted in November 2015. \"Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market.\" We wondered about the declared link. It seems plausible that if residents who consume alcohol avoid driving by enlisting a ride-sharing service, there could be fewer drinking-related accidents. In January 2015, indeed, Temple University researchers concluded from reviewing California data that the availability of ride-sharing at a lower cost than traditional taxi service in certain cities reduced drunk-driving deaths by up to about 6 percent. On the other hand, social scientists and statisticians are often quick to point out correlations don\u2019t prove causation. Even if DWI-connected accidents are down since Uber arrived in Austin, it's not a certainty that's because of Uber's presence. Uber's backup To our emailed inquiry about ride-sharing and Austin accidents, Uber spokeswoman Brooke Anderson pointed out a March 2, 2015, KVUE-TV news story stating that according to the Austin Police Department, DWI arrests and crashes were down citywide, \"and there could be a few reasons why,\" the station said. The story said the number of DWI arrests had dropped 16 percent in 2014, according to APD statistics. \"DWI-related crashes fell even more citywide, decreasing by 23 percent last year,\" as in 2014, the story said, which also is \"the year ride-sharing started in Austin, with services like Uber and Lyft entering the market.\" Asked when Austin residents became able to use a cell-phone app to call a ride-sharing service, Anderson told us Uber launched in Austin in June 2014. But it wasn't until October 2014 that the council gave permission to the Uber and Lyft ride-sharing companies to operate, effective a month later, and the city indicated plans to develop permanent rules later. KVUE\u2019s news story quoted APD DWI Enforcement Lt. Keith Walker saying he didn\u2019t know how much of an impact its arrival had on drunk driving in Austin, but he said the more travel options people have, the better. Police department figures Next, we asked the police department for a month-by-month breakdown of DWI collisions. To our inquiry about Uber's claim, department spokeswoman Amanda Cole also forwarded an email from Lt. Brent Dupre, then in the department\u2019s Highway Command, stating: \"We cannot say any drop\" in DWI collisions \"is due to the ridesharing groups.\" Different timeframes, different results We crunched the department\u2019s counts of DWI collisions different ways, mostly finding decreases over the months that ride-sharing services have been available. For instance, according to the department, Austin experienced 454 DWI collisions in 2014; that count was 24 percent less than the 597 DWI collisions in 2013, much as KVUE reported. Then again, most recently, there were 445 DWI collisions in Austin from January through October 2015, the latest month of available data when we inquired--a nearly 6 percent increase from the 422 such collisions over the comparable stretch of 2014. Still, DWI collisions in Austin over the first 10 months of 2015 ran nearly 12 percent behind the 503 DWI collisions in the comparable part of 2013, according to the department. Next, we compared tallies for the 12 months after the council\u2019s grant of permission to ride-sharing services took effect in November 2014 to the previous 12 months. According to the police, there were 497 DWI collisions in the city after ride-sharing was legal compared to 496 DWI collisions in the previous period--no change. But we also compared DWI collisions over the 17 months from June 2014, when Uber started picking up passengers in Austin, through October 2015 to the preceding 17 months. According to the police, there were 821 DWI collisions in the city from 2013 through May 2014 and 675 DWI collisions from June 2014 through October 2015, or 18 percent fewer. Our ruling Uber said: \"Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market.\" That aligns with a local news report. Yet different timeframes for making statistical comparisons suggest a range of results--even, in one slice, more DWI collisions than before. It's worth repeating that Uber is referring to correlations between ride-sharing\u2019s availability and collisions, not necessarily causation. We rate this statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",

        "claim": "\"One of the reasons I believe we\u2019re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues. That\u2019s what stirred up the population. That\u2019s what is happening in Yemen.\"",
        "doc": "Lincoln Chafee campaigned for president in New Hampshire last month proudly showcasing his foreign policy credentials based in large part on his opposition to the Iraq war. He also had some things to say about U.S. policy in Yemen. The targeting of al-Qaida terrorists with drones has killed militants and civilians in recent years. And many Yemenis havecalled on the Obama administration to end drone strikes, which Chafee refers to as \"extrajudicial killings.\" \"No more drone strikes,\" Chafee said in New Hampshire. \"One of the reasons I believe we\u2019re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues. That\u2019s what stirred up the population. That\u2019s what is happening in Yemen.\" The New America Foundation has counted 114strikes in Yemen, all but one since 2009, with 15 this year responsible for 57 deaths. The foundation bases this information on \"credible news reports.\" Have drone strikes turned the Yemen population against the U.S.? Is that the main issue? We ask because there\u2019s been heavy fighting in Yemen over the past eight months between Houthi rebels and Yemeni government forces backed by Saudi airstrikes.Cultural heritage sites have been destroyed. Food is in short supply. Rebels have chased the president from the capital city. And, according to a June 25 report in The New York Times, the warfare has displaced a million people. So why does Chafee place such a heavy emphasis on U.S. drone strikes? We asked Chafee\u2019s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, to provide evidence to support the candidate\u2019s June 14 comments. An article provided by Rich from The Long War Journal, a respected source on the fight against terrorism, tells the story of a Yemeni provincial deputy governor, also the son of a prominent tribal leader, who was killed by a 2010 drone strike. At the other extreme, Rich also emailed an April 2014 Rolling Stone article, filled with the voices of Yemenis angered by U.S. drone strikes that have killed civilians. In addition, Peter Schaapveld, a British psychiatrist quoted in the Middle East Monitor, asserted that 99 percent of the people he met during a one-week visit to Yemen were suffering drone-related post traumatic stress syndrome. The fear of drones in Yemen, is \"traumatizing an entire generation,\" according to a quote in Rolling Stone. However, other experts we talked to say that what was happening in Yemen had a lot less to do with drones and a lot more to do with the war between militant Houthis, who are Shiite Muslims, and the current government, which is backed by the U.S. and by neighboring Saudi Arabia \u2014 a Sunni Muslim nation. Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar with high-level foreign policy experience, including work for the Obama administration in 2009, wrote an analysis of the situation in Yemen one day after Chafee spoke. Riedel\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t include a word about drones. \"It is safe to say that Yemen's civil war, the humanitarian catastrophe that it faces and the Saudi intervention in the country are not caused by drone strikes,\" Riedel told us in an email. \"Yemen's problems are much more complex than a result of the drones.\" A more recent NPR clip provided by Rich, from January, includes comments from another Brookings Institution expert, Ibrahim Sharqieh, who asserted that U.S. drone strikes had contributed to instability in the country. But Sharqieh also blames the international community for ignoring the situation in Yemen over a two- to three-year period, not drones, when he talks about a solution to Yemen\u2019s latest tumult. Another Yemen expert, Shaul Gabbay, a formerprofessor at the University of Denver, asserts that it\u2019s \"a very large leap\" to suggest that dissatisfaction with drone policy at the local level is an explanation \"for what is happening in Yemen.\" \"For example, the fact that Iran is interested in destabilizing Yemen from the much more important macro conflict, arising from the Shiite/Sunni conflict, does not have anything to do with the specific use of drones,\" he said. And while surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center in other countries, including Pakistan and Jordan, have documented strong opposition to the targeting of militants with drones, no public opinion surveys have been done in Yemen. And the director of Pew\u2019s Global Attitudes surveys warns against making judgments about public opinion in the absence of a credible survey. Our ruling There is strong evidence that the U.S. drones in Yemen have antagonized many Yemenis who might have been allies in the fight against al-Qaida. But Chafee takes a big leap when he suggests that because of drone strikes \"we lost the population\" \u2014 especially when there are no public opinion polls to back him up. Others argue that a civil war, with little link, if any, to drone strikes, is what\u2019s driving unrest in Yemen, pushing about one million people out of their homes. That makes more sense to us.

        "claim": "\"Recently we have seen our government debt grow by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration -- the equivalent of about $4 billion per day.\"",
        "doc": "Rep. Leonard Lance recently criticized the Washington establishment for spending the nation into a fiscal crisis.In a July 17 column, Lance (R-7th Dist.) blamed both sides of the political aisle for driving up government debt , but also singled out President Barack Obama.\"Recently we have seen our government debt grow by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration -- the equivalent of about $4 billion per day,\" Lance wrote in the column published on CourierPostOnline.com.PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether government debt has increased that much since Obama took office -- and whether the president is responsible. We found Lance\u2019s statistics are correct, but Obama\u2019s role in debt growth is more difficult to pin down.There are two types of government debt: one includes debt held by the public and the other includes debt held directly by the government, such as in trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. Collectively, those two types of debt make up gross national debt.Lance\u2019s spokeswoman, Angie Lundberg, said the congressman was referring to debt held by the public.Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. From then until July 15 -- the most recent data available at the time Lance made his statement -- publicly held debt increased more than $3.4 trillion, from more than $6.3 trillion to more than $9.75 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department data.That\u2019s a $3.75 billion increase per day. Round up and it\u2019s \"the equivalent of about $4 billion per day.\"So, Lance had his numbers right. But is Obama responsible for that increase?Lundberg said Lance didn\u2019t \"lay blame on how we acquired that debt, just stated the fact.\" But Lance highlighted the debt growth during Obama\u2019s tenure, so we\u2019ll look at how much the president is at fault.Let\u2019s note that when Obama took office he inherited all the debt accumulated by his predecessor, President George W. Bush.An April report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative analyzed the difference in the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projections of publicly held debt and the actual debt from 2001 to 2011. The report found that about two-thirds of debt growth -- expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product -- during that time resulted from new legislation, some of which was enacted under Bush.The report said the Bush tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 2009 stimulus are three of the five \"most significant legislative drivers\" of the debt, but also notes that \"no single policy or piece of legislation, however, is overwhelmingly responsible\" for the increase.We also spoke with five experts from different Washington, D.C.-think tanks. The general consensus was that while Obama can\u2019t be saddled with all of the growth in debt since taking office, he is responsible for some of the increase.Michael Linden, director for tax and budget policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, argued that the debt attributable to Obama would be the amount accrued from legislation Obama signed, including: the stimulus package, extension of the Bush tax cuts -- though he notes that was a bipartisan deal -- and his budgets.\"It\u2019s difficult to tease out exactly how much\" that\u2019d account for, Linden said, \"but it\u2019s definitely not the whole $3.4 trillion.\"Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Obama\u2019s policies are to blame for most of the change in spending that contributed to debt growth, but not most of the change in revenues. Assigning blame for either entirely to the president would be wrong, he said.Isabel Sawhill, a budget expert with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said Obama and factors outside his control are to blame for rising debt. \"Obama\u2019s actions to fight the financial crisis and the recession did add to the deficits and debt but are not the major culprits,\" she said in an email, citing \"a persistent gap between spending and revenues, largely because of the aging population and the growing cost of health care.\"Marc Goldwein, policy director of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, highlighted some legislation Obama signed that added to the debt, but said the economy is a factor.Let\u2019s review.Lance correctly stated that government debt held by the public grew by $3.4 trillion during Obama\u2019s tenure.But experts said that while Obama can be blamed for some of that increase, he isn\u2019t responsible for it all.

        "doc": "Buhari was correct that Nigeria saw 11 quarters of consecutive GDP growth since the second quarter of 2017, but it was harder to disentangle his comments on the country\u2019s growth in 2020, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.The president\u2019s claims that all economies across the world had suffered in the first three months of 2020 were not backed by available data.Experts disagree on the value of the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business index, and while it is true Nigeria is currently ranked 131st, there is no evidence the country has risen \u201c25 places\u201d.In hisDemocracy Dayaddress on 12 June 2020, president Muhammadu Buharisought tohighlight his achievements since his previous speech.\u201cIn my 2019 address, I promised to frontally address the nation\u2019s daunting challenges, especially insecurity, economy and corruption,\u201d said Buhari.\u201cI, therefore, find it necessary to give an account of my stewardship on this day.\u201dWe looked at seven claims he made in his speech.(Note:We have contacted the presidency for evidence in support of these claims and will update our report with their response.)Claim 'We have witnessed 11 quarters of consecutive GDP growth since exiting recession.' Verdict correctIn 2016, the continent\u2019s largest economy battled aneconomic recession. Thecountry\u2019s gross domestic product, or GDP, shrunkover five quarters, fromthe first quarter of 2016 to the first of 2017. (Note: All figures are forreal GDP, which is inflation-adjusted.)A recession iswhen a country posts a negative growth rate over two consecutive quarters, Baba Madu, head of the national accounts division at Nigeria\u2019sNational Bureau of Statistics, told Africa Check.Following the negative growth, the first sign of recovery was0.72%GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017. Growth has sincebeen positive, with the most recent official data showing growth of 1.87% betweenJanuary and March 2020.This brings the number of quarters with consecutive GDP growth to 12, or 11 \u201csince exiting\u201d recession.Claim \u2018The GDP grew from 1.91% in 2018 to 2.27% in 2019 but declined to 1.87% in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the decline in global economic activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u2019 Verdict misleadingThese numbers are accurate basedon datafrom the nationalbureau of statistics. But the president\u2019s figures for 2018 and 2019 are the average of four quarters, which he then compared to a single quarter of 2020.Is it correct that this year's dip was only because of the pandemic? We asked experts.It is not accurate to attribute the drop entirely to Covid-19, Christopher Ekong, professor of economics at theUniversity of Uyoin southern Nigeria, told Africa Check.\u201cYou can say Covid-19 aggravated it, but the main reason for the drop in GDP growth rate is the drop in oil prices. Our economy is still largely dependent on oil.\u201d There had also been a drop in demand for Nigeria\u2019s oil. Both falls started in the second half of last year.Another factor hurting the economy before the pandemic was the fall in regional trade following the closure of the country\u2019s borders, Ekong said. In August 2019 Nigeriaclosed its land borderswith Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon in an attempt to curb smuggling.Security crisis in northern Nigeria also contributedAccording to development economist Prof Tukur Garba, insecurity in northern Nigeria had also affected agriculture, a major contributor to the economy.\u201cCovid-19 lockdown is a factor, but the security crisis going on in northern Nigeria is a major reason for the drop in GDP growth rate,\u201d Garba, a lecturer at theUsmanu Danfodiyo Universityin Sokoto, northwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check.Attacks by armed groups including Boko Haram has meant that many farmers in northern food-producing states were displaced. \u201cThis means reduced farming activities, low productivity and high food prices,\u201d Garba said.Claim \u2018Every single economy in the world has suffered a decline.\u2019 Verdict exaggeratedNigeria\u2019s economic growth declined on a year-on-year basis from 2.55% in the fourth quarter of 2019, to 1.87% in the first three months of 2020. This underpinned Buhari\u2019s claim that the pandemic had seen a decline in growth for \u201cevery single economy\u201d in the world, and that Nigeria\u2019s had been \u201crelatively moderate\u201d.Did no economy escape a knock? Not exactly. We identified at least two countries that did not decline,according to datafrom theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD.At least 18 of the 37 OECD countries had positive growth rates in the first quarter of 2020, but only two \u2013 Chile and Russia \u2013 grew when compared to the last quarter of 2019, the measure considered by Buhari.Chile\u2019s GDP growth rate was -2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and 0.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Russia posted 1.5% year-on-year GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2019, and 1.8% in the first three months of 2020.OECD data does show consistent declines for its member countries, tying in withgloomy forecastsfor global economic growth by theInternational Monetary Fund. Even Chile\u2019s central bank hassaidit is headed for a sharp decline over 2020.But at the time Buhari made his claim, data shows he was off the mark for at least two countries.Claim \u2018The external reserves grew from $33.42 billion on 29 April 2020 to about $36 billion in May 2020 \u2026\u201d Verdict correctExternal reserves are also known as foreign exchange reserves,accordingtoNigeria\u2019s central bank. These include foreign currency and treasury bonds and are particularly useful should the country\u2019s currency rapidly lose value.Buhari said this rise was between 29 April and \u201cMay\u201d, but did not give a specific date for May.Central bank data shows the country\u2019s gross external reserves were atUS$33.42 billionon 29 April. They increased to $33.89 billion on 4 May and to $36.59 billion on 29 May.One month too short for analysisIt would appear the president was broadly accurate on this score. But there is a caveat \u2013 you cannot use data from one month to determine the state of Nigeria\u2019s external reserves, economics lecturer Prof Sheriffdeen Tella told Africa Check. He teaches at theOlabisi Onabanjo UniversityinAgo-Iwoye, southwestern Nigeria.\u201cTo get a good picture, you look at a minimum of six months or one year. This is because payment for oil sold is often in the future. So a rise in external reserves this month may be due to proceeds of oil sold months back. Focusing on one month may serve a political purpose,\u201d said Tella.Longer term data shows the country\u2019s reserves dipped consistently from August 2019 to May 2020, when they started to recover.External reserves are important as they determine a country\u2019s creditworthiness, ability to import and to stabilise its exchange rate, Tella said.Claim \u2018[This amount in reserves] is enough to finance seven months of import commitments.\u2019 Verdict unprovenBuhari said the $36 billion in external reserves as of May 2020 could finance seven months worth of imports.But this assumed that imports for each month would be of the same approximate value, Prof Sheriffdeen Tella ofOlabisi Onabanjo Universitysaid.\u201cImports vary significantly from month to month. So you can\u2019t really say a certain amount can finance future imports.\u201dClaim \u2018Our revenue from cocoa and sesame seed increased by $79.4 million and $153 million.\u2019 Verdict unprovenReferring to his administration\u2019sefforts at growing non-oil exports, Buhari highlighted increases in two of Nigeria\u2019s biggest agricultural exports: cocoa and sesame seeds.The most recent data from the national bureau of statisticsshowsNigeria exported N49.1 billion ($160.54 million) worthof sesame seedsin the year to March 2020. (Note: This was at the official rate of $1 dollar to N306. The ratechangedto $1 to N360 on 20 March.)In the year to March 2019, the country had exported sesame seeds worth N39.6 billion ($129.5 million). This works out to a $31 million increase, against the claim of $153 million by the president.Over the same period, exports of Nigeria\u2019s various types of cocoa beans were valued at N55.98 billion ($182.94 million)in 2020, against N32.57 billion ($106.4 million)in 2019. The total value of cocoa exports therefore increased by $76.54 million, or about $3 million less than Buhari\u2019s claim.There has certainly beenan increasein the value of the two exports in the past year, but the figures provided by the president do not tally with those published by the statistics agency. In the absence of clarification from his office, we rate this claim as unproven.Claim \u2018Nigeria has risen by 25 places on the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business ranking, from 146th to 131st.\u2019 Verdict incorrectBuhari\u2019s administration has been keen to highlight the country\u2019s improved ranking on theWorld Bank\u2019s ease of doing business index.Every year, the bank publishes a report ranking how friendly countries make their economies to investors. The most recent,Doing Business 2020, was published inOctober 2019. It ranks the economies of190of the193 countrieslisted as member states of the United Nations.Without specifying a time frame, BuharisaidNigeria has moved up 25 spots on the ranking, from 146th to 131st. This is the country\u2019scurrent ranking.We went back 10 years on the index. The president\u2019s term in office started in 2015.Nigeria\u2019s ranking on ease of doing business index Year Ranking /Number of countries ranked Score 2015 170/189 47.33 2016 169/189 44.69 2017 169/190 44.63 2018 145/190 52.03 2019 146/190 52.89 2020 131/190 56.9Source: Doingbusiness.orgWhile Nigeria\u2019s2020 rankingis a 15-spot jump on the previous year, it is the same ranking it had in 2013, when 185 countries were rated.The president seemed to be referring to changes in the past year. However, the country moved up 15 places, not 25 as heclaimed. We could not find a 25-spot move. We therefore rate the claim incorrect.Claim \u2018[Nigeria] is now rated as one of the top ten reforming countries.\u2019 Verdict correctStaying with the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business ranking, Buhari said Nigeria is now rated among the top 10 reforming countries.Of the 10 economies which improved the most across three or more areas measured in 2018/19,Doing Business 2020ranks Nigeriain 10th place. It said the country had improved the ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, getting electricity, cross-border trading and enforcing contracts.Nigeriafirst madethe top reformer\u2019s list in 2018.Debate about value of ranking continuesIn March 2020, Africa Check asked experts about the index when researching a similar claim about Mauritius.Nousrath Bhugeloo is head of international growth at Ocorian , an international financial services firm, based in Mauritius. She said that the ranking is \u201ca signal that a country gives to the outside world about it\u2019s attractiveness for investment\u201d.\u201cIt is key for the financial services sector. It really shows how ready the country is to attract investors or entrepreneurs to come and do business in the country. It means that the government has more or less the right policies to attract investors,\u201d Bhugeloo said. She has previously written about the investment climate on the continent.The index has however caused soul-searching within the World Bank. It continues to face criticism over whether it provides real value.One of its critics is Prof Gerard McCormack, who teaches at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. In 2018 he wrote a paper titled Why \u201cDoing Business\u201d with the World Bank May Be Bad for You .He argued that \u201cthe (Doing Business) project has a universalist, quasi-imperialist vision in that it puts legal rules and legal systems at the fulcrum of the development equation but a variety of non-legal factors clearly impact on a country\u2019s economic performance\u201d.McCormack told Africa Check his views have not changed. \u201cThe changes in the rankings largely reflect law on the books \u2013 certainly in relation to getting credit and resolving insolvency. They do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in practice and there may be large divergence in some cases between formal law and what takes place on the ground.\u201d\u201cWhat the rankings measure are assumptions that a certain formal state of affairs will necessarily bring about economic growth. There is no guarantee that this will be the case\u201d. The debate continues.Additional reading:https://africacheck.org/reports/buharis-2018-democracy-day-speech-7-main-claims-under-scrutiny/",

        "claim": "Photo shows Myanmar army armoured vehicle attacked in Sagaing in 2021",
        "doc": "The image was published here on November 2, 2021 in a Facebook post. It has been shared more than 700 times. \"The armoured vehicle of MAL's army! Slept in a ravine after Tigyaing PDF gave it a taro,\" reads the Burmese-language caption, using a slang word for \"mine bomb\". \"MAL\" is a reference to Myanmar army leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, whose forces seized power in a coup in February, ousting civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The military's deadly crackdown on anti-coup protests has pushed some to form a so-called \"People's Defence Force\" (PDF) in their own townships -- made up of civilians who fight back against security forces with homemade weapons. The Facebook post's caption continues: \"At 11:30 pm on 1.11.2021, Tigyaing PDF attacked MAL's armoured vehicle with mine in Mawkun Mountain, Tigyaing Township, Sagaing. Apparently, the armoured vehicle hit a mine and fell down the mountain.\" Tigyaing is a town in Myanmar's Sagaing region. The photo -- which was shared alongside a similar claim in Facebook posts here, here and here -- circulated online after local media reported that local PDF attacked Myanmar army vehicles in Tigyaing on November 1. AFP has not been able to independently verify the reports. However, the claim is false. A reverse image search on Google found the photo in a news report about an Israeli tank that flipped over during training in December 9, 2019 -- more than one year before the military coup in Myanmar. \"The head of the IDF Northern Command on Monday ordered a halt to all exercises, following a training accident earlier in the day in which a tank flipped over,\" The Times of Israel reported. \"There were no injuries in the accident, in which a Merkava tank turned over, falling into a heavily wooded ditch, during a rainy, foggy training session in northern Israel.\" The same image was also shared here in a report on December 9, 2019, about the same incident by Israel Hayom, an Israeli national Hebrew-language newspaper.",

        "claim": "Colin McGregor, the brother of actor Ewan McGregor (who played Obi-Wan Kenobi), used the call sign \"Obi-Two\" in the Royal Air Force.",
        "doc": "One oft-repeated internet rumor holds that Ewan McGregor, the actor who played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d prequel trilogy, has a brother named Colin who used the call sign \u201cObi-Two\u201d while a pilot in the United Kingdom\u2019s Royal Air Force (RAF). This tidbit has been repeatedly shared on social media sites, is included in IMDB\u2019s trivia section, and has even made it into a few tabloids. Most commonly, perhaps, it\u2019s shared in the form of a meme: Ewan truly has a brother named Colin, and Colin was truly a pilot in the RAF. However, we have not been able to find any evidence to support the claim that Colin used the call sign \u201cObi-Two\u201d in an official capacity while serving in the RAF. In fact, it appears that this rumor started as a punny joke before it was mistaken for a genuine factoid about the actor and his brother. The earliest posting of this joke that we could find was posted in 2013 by Kevin Rubio, a filmmaker best known for making \u201cStar Wars\u201d parodies. From there, it was shared to the Aviation Humor website. When this tidbit is shared in earnest, it is typically accompanied by one of two pieces of \u201cevidence.\u201d One posting on the \u201cToday I Learned\u201d section of Reddit, for instance, was attached to a link to a Wikipedia article of \u201cfamous aviator nicknames.\u201d As of this writing, however, that article makes no mention of Colin McGregor or his supposed \u201cObi-Two\u201d call sign. The other piece of suggested \u201cevidence\u201d points to a BBC program entitled \u201cThe Battle of Britain\u201d that featured both Colin and Ewan discussing the history of the RAF, Colin\u2019s experience as a pilot, and, of course, the various British pilots that fought during World War II. That program, however, makes no mention of \u201cObi-Two\u201d: While we have yet to uncover any evidence that Colin used the \u201cObi-Two\u201d call sign in earnest during his time in the RAF, there is some anecdotal evidence that this may be the case. In 2016, for instance, Colin referred to himself as \u201cObi-Two\u201d in a tweet directed at his brother: While Colin has used Obi-Two in an informal humorous manner, we\u2019ve yet to see any evidence that this was his actual call sign in the RAF. We reached out to the Royal Air Force for comment and will update this article if more information becomes available.",

Sandy Jerdusky, the longtime Program Director at CMT and the woke liberal who canceled the video has been fired and replaced with up-and-coming radio personality Joe Barron. Jerdusky made the decision to pull the video himself, the network said in a statement.

Following the high-octane Asia Cup 2022 match in Sharjah on September 7, where Pakistan defeated Afghanistan, social media has seen a deluge of photos and videos of fans of both teams clashing. One such post shows two videos playing on split-screen. One shows a man wearing a Pakistan cricket jersey and white shorts, grooving with joy in the middle of the crowd in the stadium. The other video shows a brawl. People could be seen attacking each other and vandalising the stadium. People sharing the video claimed that the dancing Pakistan supporter instigated and provoked the Afghanistan fans, which resulted in the clashes.

        "doc": "On 9 November 2016, an article was posted on Steel Magnificat, a Christian blog,stating that President-elect Donald Trump had removed the phrase\u201cpro-life\u201dfrom the policies listed on his official web site within 12 hours ofwinning the election: Yes. The man who was always pro-abortion, who conveniently discovered the value of unborn human life after announcing his candidacy for president, has removed \u201cpro-life\u201d from his policies less than a day after using the pro-life movement and getting what he wanted from them. Congratulations to all of the staunch conservative \u201cpro-lifers\u201d who decided this was their one issue and the only way to achieve it was to vote Republican. Congratulations to everybody who called me a pro-abort when I said that \u2018pro-life\u201d leaders needed to repent of their Republican idolatry. He used you and dumped you, just as Steel Magnificat and anyone else with more sense than gravel predicted from the beginning. Now you know what his ex wives feel like. I hope you feel filthy. You elected a pro-abortion philandering racist narcissist, because you thought it was the only way to be \u201cpro-life.\u201d Aquick perusal ofthe Policiessection of www.donaldjtrump.com on 10 November confirmed that there was no mention of the words \u201cpro-life\u201d or\u201cabortion\u201d there (though we didfind a few news articlesaffirming Donald Trump\u2019s pro-life stance elsewhere on the web site). What became clear upon examiningarchived versions of Trump\u2019s policypagesvia the Wayback Machine, however, is that therenever were any mentions of \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cabortion\u201d in that section, asSteel Magnificat admitted in a retraction posted later the same day: The egg is officially on our faces. We at Steel Magnificat wish to sincerely and deeply apologize on the occasion of our first ever retraction. Contrary to our reporting earlier this morningit has come to our attention that \u201cpro-life\u201d HAS NEVER BEEN listed by Donald Trump as part of his official policies. Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d position was listed on the website only in a several different press releases. These press releases have been removed from his site post-election, as have all press releases from the campaign. It did briefly appear that an entire directory of campaign press releases on www.donaldjtrump.com had been redirected to the home page sometime between 1 November 2016and election day (8 November), but by the afternoon of 10 November all the articles were accessible again. Among the pages now on the site that contain information relatedto abortion policy are the following: Historically, Trump\u2019s opinion on abortion and women\u2019s right to choosehas been conflicted and subject to change. During a 1999 appearance on Meet the Press, for example, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. But \u2026 I just believe in choice.\u201d By 2011, when he was consideringa run for the presidency, however, Trumpwas saying he waspro-life. \u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he told The New York Times,\u201cI am pro life, and pro-life people will find out that I will be very loyal to them, just as I am loyal to other people. I would be appointing judges that feel the way I feel.\u201d In March2016, seven months before the election, Trump issuedthe following statement: If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed. Like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.",

        "doc": "Claims that \"police say\" you can smash a window to rescue a dog from a hot car after taking a photograph and waiting five minutes have been shared almost 180,000 times on Facebook . The posts, which encourage others to copy and paste the content in order to share it more widely, say: \"Police say if you see a dog locked in a car in case of high heat, take a picture of the dog and the car, call the police, wait 5 minutes and break the car window. \"This way you will not be charged with criminal damage and will give evidence to the police to take the dog owners to court.\" But this isn't true. The National Police Chiefs' Council told Full Fact that the information shared online is \"not accurate\". A spokesperson for the organisation added: \"If you break a car window you could be charged with criminal damage. \"If you see a dog in a hot car that appears to be in distress and/or showing symptoms of heatstroke you should call 999 and ask for the police.\" False or misleading claims online have the potential to harm individuals\u2014in this case potentially leading people to unwittingly break the law. As we have seen with the extremely high numbers of shares on these posts, online claims can spread fast and far, and are difficult to contain and correct. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in What should you do if you see a dog left in a hot car? The RSPCA warns against dog owners leaving their pets in cars on a warm day even if parked in the shade or with the windows open, and says that doing so is \"very dangerous and will cause your dog suffering and harm\". The RSPCA's advice in an emergency is to call 999 and ask for the police, as the RSPCA may not be able to attend quickly enough and has no powers of entry so would need police assistance anyway. Advice on their web site says : \"If the dog's condition is critical, and the police haven't arrived yet, your instinct will be to break into the car to free them. But please be aware that this could be classed as criminal damage. \"You may need to defend your actions in court, so please be sure you're doing the right thing. Legally, you can commit damage if you believe the car owner would consent to it if they knew the dog was in danger.\" The Criminal Damage Act 1971 says that a person charged with criminal damage might be deemed to have a \"lawful excuse\" if at the time of the offence they believed the person who was entitled to consent to the destruction or damage of the property (i.e. the owner of the car) would have consented to the damage if they had known of the circumstances. The RSPCA also recommends telling the police if you intend to break into the car and why, as well as taking photos or videos of the dog and getting contact details of any witnesses. However, doing this does not necessarily mean you will not be charged with criminal damage, as the post claims. Once removed from the car, the RSPCA advises that the dog should be moved to a shaded or cool area, and be doused with cool but not cold water, avoiding their head. The dog should also be allowed to drink small amounts of cool water. If the situation isn't critical (i.e. if the dog is not showing signs of heatstroke), the RSPCA advises attempting to establish how long the dog has been in the car (by checking a parking ticket, for example), and making a note of the registration. If parked in a car park for a shop or similar location, the advice is to ask a member of staff to make an announcement of the situation over the tannoy, if possible, and get someone to stay with the dog to monitor its condition. The RSPCA website contains more information on the signs of heatstroke in dogs . Image courtesy of A n v e s h",

        "claim": "\u201cSixty percent of (Virginia's) children don\u2019t meet national proficiency standards\u2026\u201d",
        "doc": "Gov. Glenn Youngkin is vowing to improve student performance in Virginia\u2019s public schools. \"Sixty percent of our children don\u2019t meet national proficiency standards\u2026\" Youngkin, a Republican, said during his maiden address to the General Assembly on Jan 17. He then broke the statistics down by race. We fact-checked this often-made claim by Youngkin and found that his percentage is correct, but he consistently omits the caveat that Virginia students perform better than those from most states. Across the country, 65% of students didn\u2019t meet national proficiency standards in 2019. Youngkin is referring to Virginia's performance on a standardized test called the National Assessment of Educational Progress but is better known as the \"Nation\u2019s Report Card.\" It\u2019s taken by a representative sample of fourth and eighth graders in each state. In 2019, 62% of Virginia fourth graders tested below proficiency in reading and 52% didn\u2019t reach the national standard on math. Among Virginia eighth graders, 67% were below proficiency in reading and 62% in math. The average of those results comes out at 61% below proficiency, slightly higher than Youngkin says. To grasp the meaning of that figure, however, it\u2019s important to understand some terms used in assessing NAEP results. \"Proficiency\" means a student has \"demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter,\" according to the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees NAEP tests. It means a student can analyze the subject matter and apply it to \"real-world situations.\" Proficiency is an aspirational term that \"represents the goal for what all students should know,\" the board says. That sets a higher standard for proficiency than the definition many states - including Virginia - use to assess performance on their own standardized tests. States largely use the term to define a baseline of knowledge for students in different grades. \"This variation in terminology is often a source of confusion when it comes to understanding the NAEP achievement levels,\" the national board says. Virginia\u2019s exams are called Standards of Learning tests, or SOLs, and are taken in third grade through 12th grade. Proficiency on the exams is defined as \"the minimum level of acceptable proficiency on the grade level or the course level,\" according to Charles Pyle, director of media relations at the Virginia Department of Education. In Virginia, 83% of fourth graders were deemed proficient on the state standardized test for reading in 2019, and 75% reached the level in math. But on the national tests that year, only 48% of the Virginia fourth graders were proficient in math and 38% in reading. Among Virginia\u2019s eighth graders in 2019, 77% were proficient on state math tests and 76% on the reading exam. On the national tests that year, 38% were proficient in math and 33% in reading. Youngkin wants to raise Virginia\u2019s standards for proficiency - set by the state Board of Education - to aspirational levels. He says Virginia\u2019s standards are the \"lowest in the nation.\" As we\u2019ve noted in other fact checks, Virginia in 2019 had the lowest baselines for proficiency on its standardized tests in fourth grade reading and math and eighth grade reading, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics. The NCES stresses, however, that the rigor of state standardized tests does not provide a comparison of how well students in each state are learning. On the NAEP test, which does compare states, Virginia ranked near the top in fourth grade math and reading and eighth grade math. Virginia ranked 30th on eighth grade reading. Youngkin says, \"Sixty percent of our children don\u2019t meet national proficiency standards\u2026\". He accurately cites Virginia\u2019s overall performance on standardized national tests for fourth and eighth graders in 2019. But in using this figure to criticize Virginia\u2019s public schools, he omits key information: Virginia is doing better than most states. Nationally, 65% of students fall short of the proficiency level. Proficiency is an aspirational standard on the national test. It\u2019s defined as the \"goal for what most students should know\" at their grade level. That\u2019s different from the minimum amount of knowledge they need to keep up in class. Because Youngkin\u2019s statement needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True. ",

        "claim": "Women \"earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position.\"",
        "doc": "Some \"facts\" are repeated so often they become accepted wisdom. One of them, involving the gap between pay for women and men, was offered up by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in a news release supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed a test vote in the House on June 5.\"Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace,\" Cicilline said. \"It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market.\"The 77-cent figure has been repeated a lot by politicians and news organizations. President Obama has cited it. We saw it in a Cicilline fundraising letter after the GOP blocked the paycheck bill.It was the subject of an NBC \"Meet The Press\" exchange in which liberal commentator Rachel Maddow quoted the figure and Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos said the statistic was misleading.\"For example, men work an average of 44 hours a week. Women work 41 hours a week. Men go into professions like engineering, science and math that earn more. Women want more flexibility,\" Castellano said amid a lot of overtalk.If the wage difference were so great, said Castellano, \"every greedy businessman in America would hire only women, save 25 percent and be hugely profitable.\"An issue of discriminationThe underlying issue here is discrimination and the question is whether the pay is truly different for men and women doing the same job.Because Cicilline said women earned only 77 cents for every dollar that men earned \"in the same position,\" we decided to focus on his statement.When we asked Cicilline's office about the congressman's comment, spokesman Richard Luchette sent us to the usual source: a 2011 Census report showing the 77-percent level of female earnings to male earnings from 1960 to 2010. The data, in Figure 12 of the report, apply to full-time, year-round workers more than 14 years old. (The 77-percent number has been increasingly slowly, up from 60 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.)But that's not a job-by-job comparison.Luchette said Cicilline's statement is accurate because when he referred to \"in the same position,\" the congressman meant \"to refer to men and women who were in the same position in the labor force [full-time, year-round employees].\"We believe that when someone says they are paid less \"in the same position,\" most people would understand that to be a job-by-job comparison. That's the standard we will use in this fact check.There are different ways to measure gender differences and each has its drawbacks. For example, the census looked at annual salary, but that includes bonuses and other compensation that are more likely to boost the pay of people in higher-paying brackets. It also includes self-employed but fails to account for professions such as teaching, where the full-time jobs don't last for a full year.There are other -- and perhaps better -- ways to measure the gap. For example, among people with full-time jobs, men were more likely to work longer hours than women, which would make their annual income look larger than women's.If you look at weekly pay among full-time workers, women age 16 and older are paid 81 cents for every dollar men earned in 2010, according to Table 1 of a July 2011 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.If you look at hourly pay for all workers (Table 9), women earned 86 cents for every dollar men earned that year.The amount rose to 95 cents if you looked at women who had never married, suggesting that marriage may be a factor. The rate was 97 cents among female college graduates, compared to male college graduates.Still, that's a gap.Perhaps the most revealing part of the report is Table 5, which looks at weekly earnings by the number of hours men and women work.Overall, women age 16 and older earned 75 cents in 2010 for every dollar men earned. But that hides some surprising numbers.If you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned $1.04 cents for every dollar men earned. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly $1.13 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar.By the jobBut that's still not the type of job-by-job comparison we believe Cicilline was talking about.The Bureau of Labor Statistics tried to do that, too. Table 2 of the report compared the weekly earnings for men and women -- all employed full time -- for 501 occupations.However, for nearly 8 out of 10 of those jobs, the analysts didn't have enough data on male workers or female workers to make a reliable comparison.Among the 111 categories for which a comparison was possible, women in 45 jobs were paid less than 80 cents on the dollar and women in 35 positions were paid 80 to 90 cents for every dollar paid to men doing same task.Only in 31 of the categories did women earn at least 90 cents for every dollar that the men earned. (Women were paid more in only four jobs. Pay rates for women were $1.05 for every dollar earned by men among people who worked as stock clerks and order fillers. The rates were $1.10 among female bill and account collectors, $1.12 for food preparation and serving workers, and $1.05 among social service counselors.)Even in professions where women have predominated, men made more, according to the report. Female elementary and middle school teachers earned 91 cents on the dollar compared to men. Female registered nurses made less than 87 cents.The Institute for Women's Policy Research has done a more-exhaustive evaluation of the database and concluded that women earned less in the most common, highest paying and lowest paying occupations. But, again, the data are limited.Even those numbers may be overestimating the gap.Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor released the results of a study by CONSAD Research Corp. that it had commissioned because, according to the preface by Charles E. James Sr., a deputy assistant secretary, \"the raw wage gap continues to be used in misleading ways to advance public policy agendas without fully explaining the reasons behind the gap.\"Once adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward \"family friendly\" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits, the gap shrinks to between 93 cents and 95 cents on the dollar, the report said.\"The raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action,\" said James. \"Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\"The report was released in January, 2009. Obviously, that hasn't stopped the debate.Our rulingDavid Cicilline said women \"earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position.\"His spokesman said that was only a comparison among full-time, year-round workers. But we believe the average person would read his statement as a comparison of male and female workers in the same job, an indication that wage discrimination exists.But the source of that 77-cent figure is not based on a job-by-job assessment. It's an across-the-workforce number that fails to take into a host of factors that could skew the amount.All the data we examined showed pay gaps for women from as low as 58 cents to as high as $1.12 for every dollar earned by men. And when you look at weekly earnings among wage and salary workers who work less than 40 hours a week, women earn more than men.In citing the 77-cent figure, Cicilline ignores conflicting estimates suggesting that the gender gap is narrower or, perhaps, nonexistent when lifestyle choices are taken into account. He also skirts a key problem: for most occupations, there is not enough good data to make the kind of comparison he is talking about.In other words, his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: our definition of Mostly False.(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

        "doc": "Photos of a baby wrongly claimed to be a survivor of a \u201c2019 Indonesian plane crash\u201d are again circulating. But this time, the child is being misrepresented as a \u201csurvivor\u201d of Sriwijaya Flight SJ182, which crashed in Indonesian waters last Jan. 9. The pictures were not from a plane crash, and neither were they from 2019 nor this January. They showed a kid rescued from a sea disaster in 2018. A March 2019 post of Nigeria-based FB page so-good beauty heaven, which has 18,000 shares and counting, is currently circulating among Filipino FB users. It features two images of a crying baby wrapped in a bright orange life vest, captioned: \u201c3 days after the crash of the indonesian plane. Rescuers found this baby attached to a rescue panel that his mother tied him up before making the soul [sic]\u2026. 3 days in the ocean without waters [sic] or food and in the cold. It goes beyond my understanding. But I know that God is at the origin of this miracle.\u201d It gained traction among social media users again this month, with netizens misconstruing the incident to be that involving Sriwijaya Air, which crashed into the Java Sea just minutes after takeoff less than two weeks ago. On Jan. 12, a Filipino FB user also uploaded a screengrab of a similar post but cropped out the name of the original publisher. The photos show a baby who was found floating at sea after the ferry MV Lestari Maju ran aground in the waters of Selayar Island, South Sulawesi, Indonesia on July 3, 2018. The maritime accident, caused by a leak as the ferry faced rough waters, killed at least 34 people. Indonesian news site Tribun-Medan.com reported on July 4, 2018 that rescuers found \u201ca baby adrift on high seas\u201d after the ferry\u2019s sinking. The story carried the same two photos in FB page so-good beauty heaven\u2019s post, as well as a video showing the child being tended to after he was found. Thousands shared the false FB posts this January amid rescue efforts for passengers of the Sriwijaya Air flight. As of Jan. 18, Indonesia\u2019s National Search and Rescue Agency chief, Vice Marshal Bagus Puruhito, announced a three-day extension for the search of bodies and debris from the plane crash. There were no survivors reported among the 62 people on board. The Filipino netizen\u2019s post got 18,000 reactions, 11,000 shares, and 630 comments, while FB page so-good beauty haven\u2019s version has received over 8,700 reactions, 4,000 comments and 18,000 shares. The same falsehood circulated in India and was debunked by fact-checking organizations BOOM, NewsMeter and The Logical Indian. FB page so-good beauty haven was created in November 2019, and FB group UPDATE SA MARAWI CITY DANSALAN in June 2017.

Addressing Milwaukee crime on the April 26, 2015 edition of \"Upfront with Mike Gousha,\" a show produced by WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Clarke called judges \"the weak link\" in the criminal justice system, saying violent offenders don\u2019t spend enough time behind bars. As an example, he alluded to Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, a 27-year-old Milwaukee man who shot and killed the driver of a van that killed his 2-year-old nephew in a traffic accident. Chiles previously served time in prison for his role in a bank robbery. \"When a person comes up before a judge for an armed robbery, a bank robbery -- like the guy who shot the person who hit the 2-year-old -- he got a 13-year sentence, of which he served two years, and he's put right back on the street,\" Clarke said. \"We don\u2019t have a law problem -- we don\u2019t need more laws -- we need tougher sentencing.\" Clarke's claim suggests Chiles was sentenced to 13 years in prison but served only two. That\u2019s not what happened. Chiles\u2019 case Late on the afternoon of April 12, 2015, a Sunday, Chiles\u2019 2-year-old nephew ran into a Milwaukee street and was killed by a passing van. Moments later, Chiles emerged. He shotthe driver in the headand in a spray of bullets, fatally wounded his own 15-year-old nephew. (Four days later, with police in pursuit, Chiles killed himself in a suburban Chicago hotel room.) The bank robbery occurred nearly four years earlier, on Aug. 4, 2011. Chiles, the getaway driver, was charged with being a party to the crime of robbery with threat of force. He pleaded guilty and, in January 2012, was sentenced. by Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Conen. Here is what Chiles could have faced and what he actually served for the bank robbery, in terms of time in prison and on extended supervision. The figures are based on state law and court records and were confirmed by the prosecutor who handled the bank robbery case. Total term Portion in prison Portion on supervision Maximum possible sentence 15 years 10 years 5 years Chiles\u2019 sentence 4 years 2 years 2 years A few notes on the figures: Length of sentence: Chiles benefited from helping the district attorney\u2019s office. The judge wastold that Chiles cooperated in an unrelated homicide case that stemmed from an argument during a dice game, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The way a prosecutor put it, Chiles testified at the trial of \"a more dangerous offender\" and that man was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide. Time incarcerated: Chiles was credited for the time he spent in jail while his case was pending, which is common. So, of his two years behind bars, he served six months in jail and a year and a half in prison. Extended supervision: Chiles was released from prison in August 2013 and was due to remain on extended supervision until August 2015. That meant he still had about four months to serve at the time of his death. Clarke\u2019s position As for Clarke\u2019s claim, let\u2019s note that when people talk about sentencing in a felony case, they usually think about the time an offender is being sent to prison. But technically, the sentence includes both time in prison plus time on extended supervision after the offender is released. Clarke\u2019s spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, told us the sheriff meant to say Chiles could have gotten a 13-year sentence. But she acknowledged the total maximum sentence was actually 15 years -- 10 years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision. McLaughlin said Clarke\u2019s point was that Chiles could have received a 15-year sentence but he served only two years in prison. But Clarke\u2019s claim ignores the fact that Chiles would not have been given the maximum sentence, since he had been a cooperating witness in a homicide and a recommendation for a lesser sentence was part of the plea agreement. Our rating Clarke said the man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was \"back on the street\" because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only \"served two years.\" Chiles\u2019 sentence was four years, not 13. Chiles did spend two years behind bars, as Clarke indicated, but he was also sentenced to two years of extended supervision. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Number of people killed by illegal immigrants in 2018 equals 83,211",
        "doc": "Were 194 people killed in mass shootings in the United States in 2018, while the number of those killed by illegal immigrants was 83,211? No, that's not true: Both numbers are wrong, but the number of purported murders by undocumented people is nearly five times the number of all homicides recorded in the country in any recent year. The FBI counted 17,284 intentional homicides in the United States in 2017, the last year for available figures. Police would have to be hiding at least 66,000 murder victims from 2018 for this meme to be true. Studies actually indicate that the murder rate among illegal immigrants is significantly lower than that of legal residents. The false numbers were shared in a meme (archived here) by a gun rights group on August 15, 2019. It read: Number of people killed in mass shootings in 2018 = 194 Number of people killed by illegal immigrants in 2018 = 83,211 This is what social media users saw: The meme appeared on social media soon after the El Paso, Texas, massacre in which 22 people were shot to death by a man who explained in an online post that he was motivated by a desire to kill illegal immigrants. The meme was an apparent attempt to argue that illegal immigration was a far greater threat to Americans' lives than mass shootings. But the numbers are all fake. The number of people killed by mass shootings in the United States during 2018 was 80 -- not 194. It is unclear why the meme creator would overstate that total, since the lower number would be more useful. The number of people purportedly murdered by illegal immigrants is remarkably wrong. There are about 17,000 murders each year in the United States. How could illegal immigrants murder 83,211? The FBI would have to have under-counted by 66,000, plus the number of homicides by legal citizens. While there is a shortage of studies of crimes by illegal immigrants, there are several. Each shows that legal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans and that illegal immigrants are even less likely to commit crimes. The Cato Institute, which is a public policy research organization \"dedicated to the principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and peace,\" summarized the studied in a report titled \"Illegal Immigrants and Crime - Assessing the Evidence:\" All immigrants have a lower criminal incarceration rate and there are lower crime rates in the neighborhoods where they live, according to the near-unanimous findings of the peer-reviewed evidence. Since 1911, large nationwide federal immigration commissions have asked whether immigrants are more crime-prone than native-born Americans and each one of them answered no, even when the rest of their reports unjustifiably blamed immigrants for virtually every problem in the United States. The think tank took a close look a Texas, the only state that tracks the conviction and arrest rates of illegal immigrants by crime. The 2018 study, titled \"Criminal Immigrants in Texas: Illegal Immigrant Conviction and Arrest Rates for Homicide, Sex Crimes, Larceny, and Other Crimes\", found that \"the criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born Americans. Moreover, the conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans. This result holds for most crimes.\": The vast majority of research finds that immigrants do not increase local crime rates and that they are less likely to cause crime and less likely to be incarcerated than their native-born peers. There is less research on illegal immigrant criminality, but what research there is shows that illegal immigrants have lower incarceration rates nationwide and in the state of Texas relative to native-born Americans, although they have the same rates of re-arrest in Los Angeles County. Consistent with those findings, immigration enforcement programs targeting illegal immigrant criminals have no effect on local crime rates, which indicates that they are about as crime prone as other residents. The report found that illegal immigrants made up 6.4 percent of the Texas population in 2015, they were convicted for 5.9 percent of the homicides. Native-born Americans, who made up 83 percent of the population, were convicted for 90.3 percent of the murders. Bottom line: native-born Texans murdered at a significantly higher rate than people who illegally entered the state. You can read the full Cato report below.

The file is called \"Argentina is doing it\", do NOT open it or see it, it hacks your phone in 10 seconds and it cannot be stopped in any way.\" BOOM received the viral forward on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) inquiring about it.

The Telltale signs of a hoax The viral forward follows the same pattern of WhatsApp hoaxes, like the WhatsApp message 'Sonia disowns Rahul' which was viral in April 2017 falsely claiming that on accepting the video a virus would format the phone of the user. Secondly, the viral forward falsely attributes it's the source to CNN, which if it was indeed would have received wide media coverage. Thirdly, it asks people to forward it to their friends and family which is a big red flag as most of these WhatsApp forwards follow the same pattern. The message would not have to depend on WhatsApp users to forward it if such a video would have been doing the rounds. Possible, but this bug has been fixed: Security Expert We found a Times of India report dated November 18, 2019, which stated that the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) had advised citizens to update to the latest WhatsApp version then after Facebook had reported critical security warning for WhatsApp users then. The report stated that it was because a new vulnerability had been discovered which might allow hackers to target someone by simply sending a malicious video file via WhatsApp. BOOM reached out to Rahul Sasi, an Indian entrepreneur, security expert, and white-hat hacker who said that this was possible, however, stated that the bug had been fixed by WhatsApp. \"Technically speaking its a fixed bug, that means WhatsApp is not vulnerable to this anymore,\" Sasi said. On the preventive steps that WhatsApp users could take Sasi told BOOM that, \"There is no specific way we could detect an exploit attempt of this sort, but one should always keep the recent updates on the phone.\" Other instances of WhatsApp spyware hack include in May 2019, when Financial Times had reported a vulnerability in the older version of the app that allowed attackers to inject spywares on phones through a simple in-app missed call. A select number of WhatsApp users phones were infected by a sophisticated government-grade spyware, with human rights activists being reported as prime targets. The spyware used to infect the phones through missed in-app calls on WhatsApp had been identified as Pegasus, made by an Israeli cyber intelligence company called NSO Group. WhatsApp had then put out a statement that acknowledged the threat in its older versions and encouraged its users to update their apps. Also Read: WhatsApp Spyware Hack: Should You Be Worried?",

We found posts that contained the claim on social media platforms like Reddit and Facebook. We also found posts about the claim on social media platforms before Turner's death. For example, an account dedicated to answering immigration law questions made a video in July 2022 replying to a comment made by a user on the platform about Turner's U.S. citizenship status. @bradshowlive Replying to @audreychilders506 #Immigration #Bradshowlive #foryourpage #ForYou #Greencard #for #immigrant #viral #viralvideo #fyp #fy #Immigrationlawyer #tiktoklawyer #fyp\u30b7 \u266c original sound - Brad Show Live Immigration Law We found the claims were true. Turner first moved to Switzerland in 1995. In 2013, The Washington Post reportedthat she had signed paperwork to relinquish her U.S. citizenship, months after she had \"taken the oath of Swiss nationality April 10.\" Reuters reported Turner moved to Switzerland in 1995 to join her boyfriend and later husband, record producer Erwin Bach. She discussed the move in several interviews with the media. On March 13, 1996, she told British TV presenter Des O'Conner that she was happy living in Switzerland, as she thought the country was clean and people left her alone \"to a point.\" Approximately a year later, on Feb. 21, 1997, Turner called the country home in an interviewwith former talk show host Larry King: During the interview, Turner told King she had moved there because her boyfriend moved there for work, and that she was very happy. In 2013, Turner reportedly filed paperwork to relinquish her U.S. citizenship. According to The Washington Post, that meant that she had taken Swiss citizenship with the intent to \"lose her U.S. citizenship,\" as opposed to formally \"renouncing\" her U.S. citizenship, a more complex process. The publication also reported that Turner declared she no longer had strong ties to the U.S. \"except for family, and has no plans to reside in the United States in the future.\"",

        "doc": "A video with over 44,000 views on TikTok appears to show large cages and claims they are \"human prison cages\" that local police had promised \"would be destroyed by October of 2020\" yet were still there in July 2021. The video is also being shared on Facebook . The video features two sets of videos, apparently of the same cages. In the first part, the person filming is driving past the cages and someone can be heard saying the cages have toilets in them. This footage first appeared in 2020, and false claims that the cages were \"being used to hold human trafficking victims captive\" was fact checked by Reuters at the time . The Fresno County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook in August 2020 saying it had received multiple calls about the cages stored outdoors at a ranch in Caruthers, California. The post said: \"Detectives were able to identify the location of the cages and determined they were formerly used by the California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (CDCR) to provide a safe and secure area for protective custody inmates to participate in outdoor activities. The metal holding cells or \"cages\" have been retired from service and a local metal recycling business obtained these units directly from CDCR. \"The holding cells, currently in storage, will eventually be recycled or repurposed by local area farmers to protect agricultural supplies and pumps from theft.\" So while they were arguably human cages, they were no longer in use and had been sold for repurposing. In the second half of the video, a caption appears saying \"Human prison cages in Caruthers Ca.\" and then \"Sheriff department said that they would be destroyed by Oct of 2020\" and claims the footage was recorded on 10 July 2021. While Full Fact was not able to verify when this footage was recorded or whether the cages are still there, we could find no evidence that the Fresno County Sheriff's Office ever said the cages would be \"destroyed\" by October 2020, as the caption claims. The Sheriff's Office didn't say this on its Facebook page and local news coverage didn't say this either . Full Fact has contacted the Fresno County Sheriff's Office for comment.

        "claim": "\u201cThe frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S. has declined slightly since 1900...There aren\u2019t more powerful hurricanes either.\u201d",
        "doc": "After President Joe Biden walked through a neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida in Queens in New York City, he said the evidence is now clear that climate change \"poses an existential threat to our lives.\" \"We\u2019ve got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts,\" Biden said Sept. 7. \"They\u2019ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we\u2019re living it in real time now.\" A Wall Street Journal columnist wrote that when it comes to hurricanes, too much is made of the climate change effect. \"Atlantic hurricanes are not becoming more frequent,\" columnist Bjorn Lomborg wrote Sept. 3. \"In fact, the frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S. has declined slightly since 1900.\" Lomborg continued. \"There aren\u2019t more powerful hurricanes either. The frequency of Category 3 and above hurricanes making landfall since 1900 is also trending slightly down,\" he wrote. Lomborg is a Danish political scientist and president of Copenhagen Consensus Center, a Danish think tank. He has long questioned conventional wisdom on climate change, and his column said improving infrastructure would do more to save lives and property than cutting carbon emissions. The idea that the U.S. is seeing fewer hurricanes, and fewer powerful ones as well, runs counter to the thrust of many news articles. It's fair to say that hurricanes sit in one of the knottier corners of climate change where the trends and underlying forces are tough to untangle. But Lomborg overstates the data. Lomborg cites a 2018 article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that had a chart showing a slight decline in the yearly number of hurricanes that hit the U.S. Chart of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. since 1900 (\u00a9 American Meteorological Society. Used with permission.) Hurricane activity swings up and down, and the authors use a statistical device to create an overall trend line \u2014 the dotted line in the chart. \"I simply show the data of what actually has happened, as documented in the best, peer-reviewed papers, to contrast what many believe from listening to a media filled with hurricane reporting,\" Lomborg told us. Lomborg\u2019s data, though, is more ambiguous than first appears. The study\u2019s authors note that their dotted line is not statistically significant. One of the authors, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist in the University of Colorado\u2019s environmental studies program, affirmed Lomborg\u2019s claim about a slight decline. But he also said the latest U.N. report found \"no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events.\" A finding of \"no trend\" is not the same as finding a downward trend. The decrease was not meaningful, said Christopher Landsea, National Hurricane Center\u2019s chief of Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch. Researchers in this field emphasize that looking back to 1900, there is no discernable trend, up or down. \"The main takeaway is that there's been no increase in U.S. hurricane numbers,\" Landsea said. Lomborg relies on the same Meteorological Society article to say that the frequency of strong hurricanes \u2014 those rated Category 3 or higher \u2014 is trending slightly down. But again, the authors of that article said the trend wasn\u2019t statistically significant. With his focus on the havoc wreaked by hurricanes, Lomborg looked only at storms that made landfall in the U.S. But that approach omits a lot of storms from the study of climate change and tropical cyclones. \"One has to remember that only about 12% of all hurricanes occur in the Atlantic and only about a third of those make landfall in the U.S., so he is talking about roughly 4% of all hurricanes,\" said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The interplay of all the forces that produce hurricanes are complicated. There are a host of data problems in the historic record, which Lombard acknowledged. The further back you go, the greater the chance that some hurricanes went uncounted, even the ones that hit land. There\u2019s a long-term naturally occurring fluctuation in the waters of the Atlantic that might affect the number of hurricanes \u2014 although researchers vigorously debate its role. Many, though not all, researchers believe that from 1960 to 1980, aerosol pollutants likely counteracted global warming by reducing the sunlight that warmed the ocean. This would mask the impact of greenhouse gases on hurricane trends. When clean air legislation removed those pollutants, greenhouse warming came to the fore. The U.N.\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change wrote in its latest report that there has been an \"observed increase in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.\" The report also said that there\u2019s no consensus on what lies behind that. Lomborg dismissed the idea that hurricane patterns have changed in the course of a century. But researchers looking at more recent periods, and more than just storms that hit the U.S., have the advantage of much more complete data than is available in the historic record. A 2019 paper concluded that human-driven climate change likely made Atlantic hurricanes stronger. The authors analyzed changes in wind speed for storms between 1982 and 2009 and found \"significant increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates in the Atlantic basin that are highly unusual.\" They said naturally occurring factors didn\u2019t fully explain the shift. To add to the complexity, climate change pushes hurricane trends both up and down. Greenhouse gases have raised ocean temperatures. By itself, that would lead to more hurricanes. But James Kossin, a senior scientist with the analytics group The Climate Service and a researcher at the University of Wisconsin notes that the same greenhouse gas warming tends to stabilize the atmosphere. \"It suppresses the tropical thunderstorms that would ultimately strengthen to form tropical depressions and then tropical storms and hurricanes,\" Kossin said. \"They can't get off the ground, so to speak.\" Many models predict climate change will bring fewer hurricanes, which leads Kossin to minimize the importance of Lomborg\u2019s argument. \"Concentrating on the continental U.S. landfall frequency record has become a bit of a cottage industry for anyone who wants to claim that hurricanes are not linked to climate change,\" Kossin said. \"We're not sure that there will be more storms that form, and there may even be fewer that form, but when they do form, they are more likely to be very dangerous: stronger winds, higher storm surge, more rain and freshwater flooding, slower moving and more likely to stall.\" Lomborg said that the frequency and strength of hurricanes hitting the U.S. had declined slightly since 1900. The small shift in some of Lomborg\u2019s sources doesn\u2019t amount to a statistically significant change over the past 120 years. Researchers broadly agree that given all the problems with the historic data, there is no discernable trend either way. Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980, using more robust data, find that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled. Lomborg focused on a limited number of hurricanes and pushed the data beyond what the research supports.

Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates. The difference of 202,377 more votes cast than voters voting, together with the 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, adds up to an alarming discrepancy of 170,830 votes, which is more than twice the reported statewide difference between the two major candidates for President of the United States. However, the Pennsylvania Department of State (DoS) issued a statement noting that the numbers obtained from the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) system by Ryan were not accurate because they were based on incomplete data. As the DoS observed, \u201ca few counties have not completed uploading their vote histories,\u201d and that those as-yet-unreported numbers \u201cwould account for a significant number of voters\u201d: In today\u2019s release Rep. Ryan and others rehash, with the same lack of evidence and the same absence of supporting documentation, repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories regarding the November 3 election. State and federal judges have sifted through hundreds of pages of unsubstantiated and false allegations and found no evidence of fraud or illegal voting. Now, the legislators have given us another perfect example of the dangers of uninformed, lay analysis combined with a basic lack of election administration knowledge. For instance, it is quite common to have significant \u201cundervotes\u201d for down-ballot races in a presidential election, particularly when there isn\u2019t a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. In 2000, Sen. Santorum received 200,000 more votes than President Bush, but the US Senate race still had more than 100,000 fewer votes than the presidential race. We are unclear as to what data the legislators used for this most recent \u201canalysis.\u201d But the only way to determine the number of voters who voted in November from the SURE system is through the vote histories. At this time, there are still a few counties that have not completed uploading their vote histories to the SURE system. These counties, which include Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, would account for a significant number of voters. The numbers certified by the counties, not the uploading of voter histories into the SURE system, determines the ultimate certification of an election by the secretary. This obvious misinformation put forth by Rep. Ryan and others is the hallmark of so many of the claims made about this year\u2019s presidential election. When exposed to even the simplest examination, courts at every level have found these and similar conspiratorial claims to be wholly without basis. To put it simply, this so-called analysis was based on incomplete data. According to the final tally released by the DoS, a total of 6.96 million Pennsylvania voters actually voted in the 2020 election, amounting to 76.5% of registered voters.

A disturbing footage of some youngsters falling off a jam-packed floor of a building after the metal railing gave away is being widely shared on social media. It is being said that the tragic accident took place in Guwahati. A Facebook user shared the video with the caption, \u201c7 students died after falling from 4th floor in Guwahati! Please be careful in a crowded place. May Allah rest their soul in peace.\u201d India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from the Public University of El Alto in Bolivia. Many people are sharing the video on Facebook, believing that this incident actually took place in Guwahati. AFWA probe A simple reverse search of the video keyframes shows that the tragedy took place on March 2, 2021, at the Public University of El Alto in Bolivia. The same video can be seen in this report by \u201cThe Times of India.\u201d The incident took place at the university\u2019s financial sciences building when students were trying to enter a lecture hall for an assembly, as per a report by \u201cThe New York Post.\u201d Another report by \u201cThe Sun\u201d says that at least seven students died as they dropped four floors below. Many others were injured. Had any such incident took place in Guwahati, it would have definitely been covered by every media outlet. But we did not find any report about such an incident in Guwahati. Thus, it is clear that the tragic incident of students falling off the fourth floor happened in Bolivia and not Guwahati.

        "doc": "Update: official UK guidance on how to avoid catching or spreading the new coronavirus has changed since we first wrote this article. You can read the latest advice on the NHS website here . A series of different Facebook posts shared thousands of times between them on social media make a number of claims about the symptoms of Covid-19 and ways to prevent the disease. The majority of these claims are inaccurate, and have the potential to cause harm. Although some of the advice in the posts, such as washing your hands, is factual and important for people to follow, claims about cures for the virus or symptoms which mean you definitely do not have the new coronavirus are misleading and false. This advice could be harmful if it is followed instead of the official NHS guidance . We checked another version of these posts previously, which was later edited to alter some of the more inaccurate claims. The series of identical Facebook posts this article refers to have not been edited and are still sharing incorrect information. The posts all claim the information originated from someone working at Shenzhen Hospital in China. \"If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold.\" Having a runny nose and sputum (phlegm coughed up from the lungs) does not mean that you do not have Covid-19. Early studies suggest a runny nose is a relatively uncommon symptom, but some patients did have it. Another study suggests it could be more common, and the World Health Organization (WHO) includes it in its list of possible symptoms. The main symptoms of Covid-19 are a new, continuous cough and a high temperature. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) says \"sputum production\" is a less common, but still reported, symptom. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February found a third of patients with the new coronavirus were producing sputum. \"Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.\" Pneumonia\u2014which describes the swelling of lung tissue and is usually caused by a bacterial infection\u2014has been seen in Covid-19 patients. One of the most common symptoms is a dry cough . However, as we said previously, having a runny nose does not rule out having the new coronavirus. \"This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.\" As the new coronavirus is still so new, there is a lot that is still unknown about it. You should be wary of sources that claim to have such specific details so soon after the discovery of a virus. We do not know what temperatures SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can withstand. Studies have found that another coronavirus, MERS, was more stable at lower temperatures and a warmer, humid environment slowed its transmission. The WHO says coronaviruses in general\u2014which includes MERS, SARS and the common cold\u2014can be destroyed at cooking-levels of heat, at around 70\u00b0C. Going in the sun is unlikely to protect you from Covid-19. Some of the countries with confirmed cases have warm climates, where the temperature is regularly above 27\u00b0C. We've written more about how viruses react in warmer climates here . \"If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.\" There is no evidence that the virus which causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, spreads differently to other coronaviruses. Other coronaviruses can be transmitted by droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, but it is difficult to say exactly how far droplets spread when you sneeze. The distance they travel can be impacted by a range of factors including humidity and temperature. Research from MIT has suggested droplets can spread several metres from the sneezing person. The NHS recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve, but not your hands, when you sneeze. You should put tissues in the bin and wash your hands afterwards. \"If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours \u2013 so if you come into contact with any metal surface \u2013 wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.\" No one knows how long the virus that causes Covid-19 can survive on surfaces yet. A new study in America, which has not yet gone through the peer-review process to ensure accuracy, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable on cardboard for up to 24 hours and for two or three days on plastic and stainless steel, although its strength was \"greatly reduced\". However, the researchers noted that future experiments should test how viable the virus is when it is spread from nasal secretion or sputum, and in varying environmental conditions rather than a lab. The WHO says : \"Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the Covid-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. \"This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature of humidity of the environment.\" \"On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent will kill it.\" The UK government has advised people staying at home because of suspected Covid-19 symptoms to use usual household products like detergent and bleach when cleaning because \"these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces.\" It adds: \"To minimise the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry. Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All dirty laundry can be washed in the same load. If you do not have a washing machine, wait a further 72 hours after your 7-day (for individual isolation) or 14-day isolation period (for households) has ended when you can then take the laundry to a public launderette. The CDC recommends people in the same household as those with Covid-19 or someone suspected of having it, or their intimate partners or caregivers, should remove and wash soiled clothing and wear disposable gloves when handling it. It says normal laundry detergent and the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label should be used. We haven't found any reliable source saying exactly how long the virus can survive on fabric. \"Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.\" We can't find any scientific evidence that warm water can cure or prevent diseases caused by viruses. Hot drinks can be a comfort to those suffering with coughs and colds. \"Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes but \u2013 a lot can happen during that time \u2013 you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.\" It is good advice to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently. However, it is not clear how long Covid-19 can survive on your hands, especially not down to the minute. The post is right to mention that rubbing your eyes, mouth or nose without washing your hands can be a problem, as these are prime entry points for viruses and bacteria. \"You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.\" Other fact checkers have also written about this claim, which was attributed to respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, a key figure during the SARS outbreak. The hospital where he worked debunked the rumour via a post on social media site Weibo. Gargling with salt water is recommended by the NHS for adults who have a sore throat , but only to relieve symptoms once you have caught it, not as a preventative measure. The WHO has said that there's no evidence saline can prevent Covid-19. \"Can't emphasise enough \u2013 drink plenty of water!\" We've previously checked claims that drinking water will prevent you catching the virus, or cure you if you have it, and found they were incorrect. The WHO has said : \"While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\" \"THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.\" This is a roughly accurate description of the common symptoms of Covid-19. Some patients may experience other symptoms, and the timings may differ. The CDC says a sore throat is one of the \"less commonly reported respiratory symptoms\". The most common symptoms are a fever, cough, muscle pain and shortness of breath, as the post claims, but not everyone who has Covid-19 will get pneumonia. The NHS does not mention nasal congestion that 'feels like drowning' as symptom of the new coronavirus. New advice published on 18 May now says that anyone experiencing loss of taste or smell (known as 'anosmia') should also self-isolate. If you experience either of the two major symptoms of Covid-19 the NHS says to look out for (a high temperature or a continuous cough) you should stay at home for seven days and you do not need to contact their 111 service. If your fever is gone after seven days you can return to your normal routine (even if you still have a cough), but if you still have a fever remain at home until your temperature returns to normal levels. If these symptoms don't go away after seven days, if you can't cope with them at home or if you get worse then use the NHS online 111 coronavirus service . If you can't get the help you need there then you should call the 111 phone service. If you have a medical emergency, you should still call 999 as you would normally. We've written more about what you should do if you think you have the new coronavirus, and what anyone you live with should do, here .",

        "doc": "The notion of counting the number of \"green\" jobs in America made us think, oddly enough, of a middle-age guy trying for cool by pairing a sport coat with blue jeans. Not easy. Yet quite matter-of-factly, while touting a clean energy jobs bill she introduced, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin made the following statement Jan. 22, 2014: \"Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce, including in clean energy and sustainability, which is more than the amount of people working in the fossil fuel industry.\" When we put the Wisconsin Democrat\u2019s claim to Daniel Kish at the Institute for Energy Research, he told us that both green and fossil fuel industry job numbers are sometimes thrown around with abandon. \"This gets really dicey real quick,\" he said. \"Everybody\u2019s got their dueling banjos.\" That\u2019s PolitiFact Wisconsin\u2019s kind of music. Baldwin\u2019s evidence To back his boss\u2019 claim, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus cited two reports. Both are from solid sources, though they mix sports coats and -- er, apples and oranges -- a bit. 1. Federal report In 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics embarked on an annual tally of green jobs. The agency had the advantage of considering a definition of green jobs proffered a year earlier by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, which produced its own green jobs count. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed 120,000 business and government establishments within 325 industries that were \"identified as potentially producing green goods or providing green services.\" Those surveyed said whether they produced green goods and services and the percentage of their revenue or employment associated with that output. Green goods and services were defined as those that \"benefit the environment or conserve natural resources.\" They fall into one or more of the following five groups: 1) Production of energy from renewable sources; 2) energy efficiency; 3) pollution reduction and removal, greenhouse gas reduction, and recycling and reuse; 4) natural resources conservation; and 5) environmental compliance, education and training, and public awareness. So, the list of green jobs is quite varied, including jobs in areas such as farming; home construction; electric, solar and other types of power generation; petroleum and coal products manufacturing; urban mass transit; newspaper publishing; advertising and public relations services; waste treatment and disposal; museums and zoos; and social advocacy organizations.The Bureau of Labor Statistics produced its second -- and, it turns out, final -- green jobs report in March 2013. It estimated that \"employment associated with the production of green goods and services\" -- full- and part-time jobs -- exceeded 3.4 million in 2011. Manufacturing, with 507,000 green jobs, was the largest sector. Goods produced by those jobs included air conditioning and refrigeration equipment meeting selected standards, hybrid cars and parts, and pollution mitigation equipment. Kish, who is senior vice president for policy at the industry-backed Institute for Energy Research, pointed out that 886,000 of the 3.4 million were government jobs -- not jobs, he said, in which people are \"making or installing windmills and solar panels.\" \"Green,\" Kish said, is a \"political word, used by politicians and advocates, that is truly elusive.\" Nevertheless, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is well-established as the official jobs counter for the federal government. The 2013 report, for the number of green jobs in 2011, remains the latest available. That report said that because of budget cuts, no more green counts would be done. 2. Think tank study The Brookings Institution report we noted above was produced in 2011, so it\u2019s a little dated. Brookings estimated that in 2010, there were 2.7 million green jobs -- that is, jobs that \"directly contributed to the production of goods and services that had an environmental bene\ufb01t.\" Brookings didn\u2019t do a count of fossil fuel industry jobs, but it did make a comparison using federal government tallies. Its report said that in 2010, there were 1.3 million jobs that directly supported \"the production of fossil fuel-based energy, derivative manufactured products and machinery.\" If all wholesale and retail distributors, transporters and other workers -- such as gas station employees -- were included, the fossil fuel tally would be 2.4 million jobs, Brookings said. Brookings scholar Jonathan Rothwell told us some critics view the think tank\u2019s definition of green jobs as too expansive. For example, some 350,000 public transportation jobs in the green tally include not only bus drivers but secretaries, janitors, executives and all other employees who work for bus companies, he said. Brookings' definition of green jobs \"was very broad and included any economic activity that has an environmental benefit -- from public transportation to waste management,\" Rothwell acknowledged, adding that because \"only a small portion of energy comes from green sources, fossil fuel employees are a much larger share of the energy sector's workforce.\" But Rothwell noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics adopted a similar definition when it did green jobs counts. And we note that BLS arrived at a roughly similar green jobs estimate. So, the most recent federal report backs the first part of Baldwin\u2019s statement, that there are more than 3 million green jobs. The older think tank report she cites doesn\u2019t say there were more than 3 million green jobs, but does say that green jobs outnumbered fossil fuel industry jobs as of 2010. Other views One thing to underline here is that counting green jobs is a different sort of animal. As CNN/Money observed when the first Bureau of Labor Statistics green jobs report came out in 2012, comparing \"green jobs to another singular sector isn't really fair. The green jobs survey took into account a wide variety of jobs in over 300 different industries.\" As for the oil and gas industry itself, a July 2013 report was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, that was an update of a report done two years earlier. The later report said there were 2.59 million jobs in the oil and natural gas industry in 2011. PricewaterhouseCoopers said it utilized data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau for its study. The study noted that the oil and natural gas industry \"encompasses a number of activities that span separate industry classifications in government economic data.\" For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production is included in the mining sector; and oil refining is part of the manufacturing sector. The study defined the oil and gas industry to include all such activities. The petroleum institute noted to us criticism of how the federal government defines green jobs, including an editorial in Investor\u2019s Business Daily that called the annual count \"phony.\" A final note: In November 2012, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, made a claim similar to but more broad than Baldwin\u2019s, saying there were \"more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.\" That was before the latest reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and American Petroleum Institute that estimated green and fossil fuel jobs for 2011. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated the statement True. Our colleagues noted that at the time, the number of green jobs as estimated by BLS exceeded the number of oil and gas jobs estimated by the petroleum institute. Our rating Baldwin said: \"Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce,\" which is more than the number \"of people working in the fossil fuel industry.\" The latest estimates are for 2011. The federal government says there were 3.4 million green jobs, while a national oil and gas trade group says there were 2.59 million oil and gas jobs. We rate Baldwin\u2019s statement True.

The person in the video points to an interview from 2015 with Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, as evidence for these claims. In the clip Mr Schwab says: \"The difference of this fourth industrial revolution is, it doesn't change what you're doing, it changes you. If you take genetic editing, just as an example, it's you who are changed and of course this has a big impact on your identity.\" The voice in the Instagram video seems to suggest that the clip means the Covid-19 vaccines that use mRNA technology \"have edited you\". As we have written before , this is not the case . Vaccines using mRNA technology, like those from Moderna and Pfizer, contain the genetic code for a spike protein on the virus' surface . As the Vaccine Knowledge Project at Oxford University says, when the mRNA gets to the body's cells, \"the same machinery that is used to make our own proteins can make the spike protein. \"This mRNA has no way of getting into the nucleus where our DNA is. Even if it could, mRNA cannot fuse with DNA and as with our own mRNA, has no way of getting translated back to DNA. As such, there is no way for human DNA to be altered by an mRNA vaccine. This mRNA lasts a few days before the cell removes it, but in that time we have produced a lot of spike protein to stimulate the immune response.\" Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in Covid-19 vaccines do not contain graphene oxide The video also claims that it's \"proven\" and \"not a conspiracy theory\" that there's graphene oxide in the vaccines, which it says\"reassembles in the body and becomes a supercomputer, a superconductor as well\". We've already fact checked false claims that the vaccines contain graphene oxide. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency previously told Full Fact: \"There is no graphene oxide in any of the authorised vaccines\". This claim seems to originate from a thoroughly debunked paper from a professor at a Spanish university. The paper has not been peer reviewed or published in any reputable scientific journal and the University of Almeria, where the author reportedly works, has distanced itself from the manuscript. There's also no evidence that graphene oxide can do what the person in the video claims.",

Der fr\u00fcheste dokumentierte Fall in der PDF-Liste ist mit 9. Dezember 2020 angegeben, der erste Covid-19-Impfstoff bekam jedoch erstam 21. Dezember 2020 seine Zulassung. Bei dem angegebenen Fall handelt es sich au\u00dferdem um den Zusammenbruch eines Fu\u00dfballers vom franz\u00f6sischen Verein RC Strasbourg, der sich tats\u00e4chlich imSeptember 2021ereignete./n/nEs gibt noch weitere Fehler in der Liste. Wir suchten darin gezielt nach Erw\u00e4hnungen von Deutschland (Suchbegriff \u00fcbersetzt ins Hebr\u00e4ische mit Google Translate). Es gibt zw\u00f6lf F\u00e4lle aus Deutschland \u2013 doch ein Fall ist in der Liste doppelt vorhanden (Anil Usta vom VfB Schwelm). Der 50-j\u00e4hrigeFu\u00dfballtrainer Dirk Splitsteservon der SG Traktor Divitz, der einen Herzinfarkt erlitt, wird f\u00e4lschlich als \u201eVolleyballtrainer\u201c bezeichnet./n/nMehrere der F\u00e4lle tauchten bereits in \u00e4hnlichen Listen auf, die seit Anfang Oktober 2021 in Deutschland verbreitet wurden und \u00fcber die wirbereits einen Faktencheckverfasst haben. Damals teilte uns der Leiter der Arbeitsgruppe Sportkardiologie bei der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Kardiologie, Dierk-Christian Vogt, mit, dass 2021 keine Zunahme von Herzstillst\u00e4nden bekannt sei./n/nBehauptungen \u00fcber Herzstillst\u00e4nde bei Sportlern kursieren seit Monaten international/n/nDas Narrativ von vermeintlich mysteri\u00f6sen Herzproblemen bei Sportlern nahm seinen Anfang im Sommer 2021, nachdem der d\u00e4nische Fu\u00dfball-Nationalspieler Christian Eriksen w\u00e4hrend eines EM-Spiels einen Herzstillstand hatte. Der Artikel vonReal-Time-Newserw\u00e4hnt Eriksen ebenfalls, obwohl bereits in mehreren Faktenchecks (hier,hierundhier) recherchiert wurde, dass er nicht geimpft war./n/nDie Recherchen aus Israel werden in den deutschsprachigen Beitr\u00e4gen au\u00dferdem nicht richtig wiedergegeben. BeiCorona-Transitionhei\u00dft es, 183 Profisportler seien zusammengebrochen \u2013 die Liste vonReal-Time-Newsenth\u00e4lt jedoch zumindest f\u00fcr Deutschland vor allem Amateursportler, und die Personen sind auch nicht alle beim Sport kollabiert. So f\u00fchrt die Liste auch den Ex-Nationalspieler Miroslav Klose auf, der keine Herzprobleme hatte, sondernThrombosen im Bein, wie er in einem Interview erkl\u00e4rte. Davon, dass das etwas mit einer Impfung gegen Covid-19 zu tun hatte, sagte Klose im Interview nichts./n/nNein, es gab keinen f\u00fcnffachen Anstieg von pl\u00f6tzlichen Herzstillst\u00e4nden bei Fifa-Sportlern/n/nPl\u00f6tzliche Herzstillst\u00e4nde k\u00f6nnen bei Sportlern vorkommen, auch wenn sie jung sind. Insbesondere Sportarten wie Fu\u00dfball und Laufen sind betroffen. Beim pl\u00f6tzlichen Herzstillstand beim Sport ist die Ursachelaut der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Kardiologie (DGK)meist ein Kammerflimmern, also das unkontrollierte Zusammenziehen des Herzmuskels. Die Ursache seien oft unentdeckte Herzerkrankungen./n/nDie Behauptung, solche F\u00e4lle seien 2021 bei Fifa-Sportlern um das f\u00fcnffache gestiegen, ist falsch. Als Grundlage f\u00fcr diese Aussage dienteReal-Time-Newsein Abgleich mit einerListe bei Wikipedia. Sie listet Fifa-Fu\u00dfballer auf, die w\u00e4hrend eines Spiels oder danach gestorben sind. Die Liste zeige pro Jahr 4,2 Todesf\u00e4lle, schreibtReal-Time-News, 2021 habe man dagegen 21 F\u00e4lle gefunden. Bei Wikipedia steht jedoch auch, dass die Liste der vergangenen Jahre unvollst\u00e4ndig ist. Der Vergleich ist also nicht aussagekr\u00e4ftig./n/nWissenschaftliche Auswertung des Fifa-Registers: Im Schnitt 123 F\u00e4lle pro Jahr/n/nEs gibt aber verl\u00e4sslichere Daten \u2013 die Fifa selbst hat 2014 ein Register eingef\u00fchrt, in dem solche F\u00e4lle dokumentiert werden. Die\u201eFifa Sudden Cardiac Death in Football Registry\u201cwird von der sportmedizinischen Fakult\u00e4t der Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes betrieben. Im Dezember 2020 wurden die Daten f\u00fcr die Jahre 2014 bis 2018 imBritish Journal of Sports Medicinever\u00f6ffentlicht./n/nDas Ergebnis: Innerhalb von f\u00fcnf Jahren wurden 617 F\u00e4lle von pl\u00f6tzlichem Herztod, \u00fcberlebtem pl\u00f6tzlichem Herzstillstand oder traumatischen pl\u00f6tzlichem Tod bei Fu\u00dfballspielern aus 67 L\u00e4ndern verzeichnet. Die meisten Meldungen kamen aus Italien, gefolgt von Deutschland. 142 Personen \u00fcberlebten den medizinischen Notfall./n/nIm Schnitt gab es also laut der Fifa-Datenbank pro Jahr durchschnittlich 123,4 F\u00e4lle, bei denen Fu\u00dfballspieler auf dem Feld oder eine Stunde nach dem Spiel zusammenbrachen. Das sind zwar weniger als die 183 F\u00e4lle, die die israelische SeiteReal-Time-Newsf\u00fcr 2021 zusammengetragen hat, doch wie bereits erw\u00e4hnt enth\u00e4lt die Liste auch andere Sportarten und andere medizinische Diagnosen, wie die Bein-Thrombosen von Miroslav Klose. Vor allem sind die erw\u00e4hnten 21 Todesf\u00e4lle bei Fifa-Sportlern keine ungew\u00f6hnlich hohe Zahl \u2013 laut dem Fifa-Register starben im Schnitt pro Jahr 95 Fu\u00dfballspieler./n/nEs l\u00e4sst sich also kein Anstieg solcher F\u00e4lle im Jahr 2021 belegen. Ebensowenig ist ein Zusammenhang zu Corona-Impfungen nachweisbar./n/nWas stimmt: Bei jungen M\u00e4nnern treten nach mRNA-Impfungen in seltenen F\u00e4llen Herzentz\u00fcndungen auf/n/nWie oft bei irref\u00fchrenden Behauptungen gibt es einen wahren Hintergrund: Es ist m\u00f6glich, dasseine Herzmuskelentz\u00fcndungzu einem pl\u00f6tzlichen Herzstillstand beim Sport f\u00fchren kann. Eine solcheMyokarditiskann verschiedene Ursachen haben, zum Beispiel eine Virusinfektion. Herzmuskel- und Herzbeutelentz\u00fcndungen (Myokarditis und Perikarditis) sind tats\u00e4chlich auch eine selteneNebenwirkung von mRNA-Impfstoffengegen Covid-19./n/nIm aktuellstenSicherheitsbericht des Paul-Ehrlich-Instituts (PEI)vom 23. Dezember 2021 hei\u00dft es: Bis Ende November 2021 seien in Deutschland rund 107 Millionen Impfungen mit mRNA-Impfstoffen durchgef\u00fchrt worden. Es seien 1.554 Herzmuskel- oder Herzbeutelentz\u00fcndungen gemeldet worden, bei denen der Verdacht auf einen Zusammenhang zur Impfung besteht. Die Melderate sei bei Jungen, Jugendlichen und M\u00e4nnern unter 30 Jahren am h\u00f6chsten gewesen. In Deutschland wird der Impfstoff von Moderna seit Novemberaufgrund des Myokarditis-Risikosnicht mehr f\u00fcr Unter-30-J\u00e4hrige empfohlen./n/nDas PEI schreibt: \u201eDie publizierten Daten zeigen sehr konsistent, dass die ganz \u00fcberwiegende Mehrheit der Patienten mit einer Myo-/Perikarditis nach Impfung mit mRNA-Impfstoffen gut auf Behandlung und Ruhe ansprechen und sich schnell besser f\u00fchlen, auch wenn im Einzelfall schwerwiegendere Verl\u00e4ufe beobachtet wurden.\u201c/n/nRedigatur: Matthias Bau, Steffen Kutzner/n/nDie wichtigsten, \u00f6ffentlichen Quellen f\u00fcr diesen Faktencheck:/n/nIhre Spende gegen Fake News/n/nFalschmeldungen und Verschw\u00f6rungsmythen spalten die Gesellschaft.

        "doc": "An altered video showing a Kaun Banega Crorepati segment where a contestant loses the highest cash prize of Rs. 7.5 crore due to wrongly answering the final question on the Mahakal Lok of Madhya Pradesh is circulating to make false claims on social media. The claims state that the contestant erroneously answered about the Mahakal Lok being built by Bharatiya Janata Party's Shivraj Singh Chouhan.Those sharing the video claim that the contestant was misled by BJP's propaganda.BOOM found these claims to be fake; our fact-check shows that the viral video has been edited, and that the original episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati, from which the viral footage has been taken, did not feature any question about the Mahakal Lok construction. The final question worth Rs.7.5 crore that was originally asked to the contestant was, \"Which British Army unit was given the motto 'Primus in Indis' because it was the first to serve in India?\"An X user (formerly Twitter) shared the video with the caption, \"This man lost \u20b9 7.5 crore because of the fake propaganda of the BJP.

Click here, here and here to view such posts.Fact CheckBOOM watched the viral video closely, and observed that as soon as the host, actor Amitabh Bachchan, starts reading out the question, the audio changes completely, along with the voice and ambient sounds.Furthermore, in the video shared by the Facebook page Satna Congress, Bachchan's voice is not synchronised with his lip movements. At 0:18 mark, his voice can be heard, even though his mouth does not appear to move.These suggest that the audio has been tampered with.In the viral video, Bachchan addressed the contestant with the name \"Shashwat Goel\". Taking cue from this, we did a Google keyword search with \"shashwat goel kbc\", and came across an article by Indian Express titled, \"KBC 14: Can you answer the Rs 7.5 crore question that Shashwat Goel failed to answer?\"According to the article, the question appeared during KBC Season 14, with the episode airing on October 12. The final question for Rs. 7.5 crore, that was directed at Goel, was, \"Which British Army unit was given the motto 'Primus in Indis' because it was the first to serve in India?\" The options given to Goel were, \"A. 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot; B. 1st Coldstream Guards; C. 5th Light Infantry; D. 39th Regiment of Foot.\"The article states that Goel fails to answer correctly, thereby losing Rs. 7.5 crore, and winning Rs. 75 lakh instead.BOOM also accessed a video on YouTube, that compiled all the questions asked to Goel. At 1:11:43 mark, Bachchan can be heard asking the final question worth Rs.7.5 crore, \"Which British Army unit was given the motto 'Primus in Indis' because it was the first to serve in India?\"We compared keyframes from the above video with the viral video, and found them to be the same. However, the viral video had a completely different question.We also accessed a website that archives all the questions and answers from KBC, and looked through all the questions from the episode that was aired on October 12, 2022.While we could view the question \"Which British Army unit was given the motto 'Primus in Indis' because it was the first to serve in India?\", that was mentioned in the Indian Express article, we were unable to view any question related to the Mahalak Lok and its construction.We also did a keyword search with \"mahakal lok kaun banega crorepati\", and were unable to find any video from a reliable source that would suggest that such a question was asked in the show.",

Of these, 61,395 are names of Muslims. These claims have been circulating on Facebook in Hindi, as shown in the images circulated below with a photo of NDTV's Ravish Kumar. Upon performing a reverse search on these images, BOOM found that this images happens to be circulated in the past too, on various social media platforms. The claim has also manifested itself to other posts dissecting these numbers: Figures of names engraved on INDIA GATE don't speak a lie! The whopping numbers of Muslims sacrificing their lives for the freedom of their beloved INDIA, exhibit their sheer humongous pride and lavel of patriotism for India, proudly leading all Indian people by huge margin! pic.twitter.com/X5FO3lOKQd \u2014 MOHD Yahya Ansari (@MOHDYahyaAnsar3) October 16, 2018 Fact Check History To India Gate Contrary to the claims as above, the India Gate as a monument does not honour those who fell during Indian Independence struggle. It is a war monument built to honour those of the erstwhile British Indian Army soldiers who fell in World War 1. As written at the summit India Gate itself: TO THE DEAD OF THE INDIAN ARMIES WHO FELL AND ARE HONOURED IN FRANCE AND FLANDERS MESOPOTAMIA AND PERSIA EAST AFRICA GALLIPOLI AND ELSEWHERE IN THE NEAR AND THE FAR-EAST AND IN SACRED MEMORY ALSO OF THOSE WHOSE NAMES ARE HERE RECORDED AND WHO FELL IN INDIA OR THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER AND DURING THE THIRD AFGHAN WAR Additionally, the peak of the monument consists of the words 'India', next to which are the inscriptions: MCMXIV - roman numeral for 1914 to the left MCMXIX - roman numeral for 1919 to the right These are the years associated with World War 1. Both the inscription quoted above and the the can be viewed in the following image of the inscriptions at the summit of the monument: The foundation of India Gate was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921, and was designed by Edward Lutyens .It was inaugurated a decade after that by then Viceroy Lord Irwin. These events transpired before independence, which was attained in 1947, implying that the monument cannot be dedicated to freedom fighters. Names Inscribed On The Walls of India Gate India Gate being a World War 1 era monument means that India was then part of the British Commonwealth. India Gate bears the name of not only Indian soldiers, but also those of the United Kingdom and Australia. There are 13,216 names inscribed in total. A full database of these names can be found with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), an international organisation responsible for identifying and maintaining the graves of soldiers from Commonwealth soldiers who lost their lives in both World Wars. India provided funding to this organisation in 2015/16, as per their website. While the CWGC provides holistic information on the names of the soldiers inscribed on the India Gate, it makes no mention of their religion. This is in line with their principles, where they state : There should be no distinction made on account of military rank, race or creed BOOM checked the following two sources to debunk what is being circulated through these images: The official website of Delhi Tourism. CWGC data, which can be found and downloaded here. Therefore, there is no evidence to show that 95,300 names are inscribed on the India Gate or that a majority of them inscribed are Muslim.",

        "claim": "\"Russian officials reportedly have found the perpetrator behind the Kerch Bridge explosion in occupied\u00a0Crimea\"said one Twitter user",
        "doc": "An explosion damaged the Kerch Bridge earlier this week. The bridge connects Russia with the city of Kerch in Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Images and videos of the blast have been going viral since then. But some of these are old or manipulated, even fooling media organizations. DW takes a closer look.\n\nA truck with disappearing wheels?\n\nSome reports purport to show the perpetrators of the Crimea bridge explosion, which Russia has classified as a terrorist attack. Investigators with Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB) claim Ukraine's military intelligence agency, known as HUR, is responsible for the blast and provided what they allege is proof: a suspicious truck.\n\nClaim: \"A video shows the inspection of a truck carrying an explosive device,\u201d Russian news agency, RIA Novosti reported, citing the FSB intelligence agency. An X-ray image of the truck is said to show its explosive cargo.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nThe truck in the X-ray photo isn't identical with the truck in the video widely accepted as showing the vehicle responsible for the blast. This difference is obvious if you compare a screenshot from the video alongside the X-ray image (shown below). The video which is allegedly surveillance footage, shows the search of a truck at a customs post in Taman, Russia. The image, according to Russian media citing the FSB, is allegedly an X-ray of the truck carrying the explosives hidden among pallets loaded with rolls of film.\n\nThe truck in the X-ray image isn't identical with the truck in the surveillance video: it has a different number of axles, the spare wheel is in a different position and it's lacking a grille on the side.\n\nThe most striking discrepancy between the two vehicles is the different number of wheels, or axles. In the X-ray image, the second wheel on the front right is missing. The truck in the surveillance video has a total of three axels, while the truck in the X-ray image has only two.\n\nThe spare wheel towards the end of the trailer is also in a different position in each image. Additionally, the X-ray image doesn't have a grill on the side between the two sets of tires that are visible on the truck in the surveillance video. As such, it is clear that the video and the X-ray show two different trucks.\n\nThe truck being searched in the screenshot is said to have caused the explosion on the Crimean bridge, according to the FSB\n\nOnly four days after the explosion on the Crimea bridge, Russian state media such as RIA Novosti, citing the FSB intelligence service, published a false tip-off of who the perpetrators were, which caused Russian investigators to be ridiculed.\n\nAn invisible boat?\n\nSome say the cause of the explosion was not on, but rather under, the bridge.\n\nClaim: Footage from a surveillance camera allegedly shows a boat under the Crimea bridge just seconds before the explosion. So writes this Twitter user, among others: \"It's now clear that this explosion didn't come from the so-called kamikaze truck but from an underwater drone or a small boat filled with explosives.\"\n\nVerdict: Unsubstantiated.\n\nThe video posted in the tweet is surveillance footage of the Crimea bridge showing the car bridge from the direction of Kerch on the right side of the image. At 00:03 in the video, a wave-like movement is visible on the water. However, it's not possible to make out what exactly caused the water to move because just a second later, the explosion obscures the view.\n\nMany other users on social media also used the video clip to claim a boat caused the explosion. Here for example, people allege that a boat is recognizable in slow motion. DW's fact-checking team found no evidence of a boat at the time of the explosion. Nick Waters, a digital image analysis expert at Bellingcat, an investigative organization, can't see a boat in the image either. In his Twitter thread on the Crimea bridge, Waters writes: \"Some have claimed a boat is visible in this still. If there is, I can't see it. I can see some waves, which might or might not be indicative of something, but I can't see a boat.\"\n\n\n\nThe surveillance camera footage doesn't prove that there was a boat under the Crimea bridge at the time of the explosion.\n\nA dashcam filming the explosion?\n\nClaim: \"The moment of the strike on #Crimea bridge,\" writes one user about a video that quickly went viral on Twitter.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nThe 12-second footage of a car driving on the Crimea bridge appears to show the car being hit by a blast. At the 00:05 timestamp, a cloud of smoke can be seen rising in the background. Many users doubt the authenticity of this video, as the lighting conditions in the video (a bright day) don't match those during the explosion at 6 a.m. local time on October 8, 2022, which was in the dark morning hours, as the surveillance camera footage shows. This isn't the only inconsistency. When DW's fact checking team performed a reverse image search for individual keyframes of this video, we located older versions of this video that predate the blast. Among others, we found this video in a tweet from May 9, 2022.\n\nThis video appeared months before the Crimea bridge explosion and was manipulated\n\nWhen the video was tweeted in May 2022, the recording was presented as an explosion on the Crimean bridge \u2014 with success: Leading Russian media, such as the state news agency TASS and the weekly newspaper Argumenty i Fakty reported the explosion, citing eyewitnesses. But on the same day, the video recording was declared a fake by the self-proclaimed government of Russian-annexed Crimea.\n\nDigital forensics experts have also cast doubt on the video's authenticity. Analyzing the recording on behalf of AP news agency, Hany Farid from the University of California found indications of manipulation: Two individual frames of the video are almost identical, which is very unlikely given the movement in the video. Traces of manipulation of the soundtrack were also detected by Catalin Grigoras of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, according to AP.\n\nWhat is certain in any case: The video doesn't show the explosion on the Crimea bridge on October 8.\n\nThe perpetrator's ID card?\n\nAn image of a Ukrainian ID card that allegedly belongs to a suicide bomber responsible for the explosion also spread on social networks. Media such as the newspaper Euro Weekly News, the largest English newspaper in Spain, published the claim along with the picture. What's behind it?\n\nClaim: \"Russian officials reportedly have found the perpetrator behind the Kerch Bridge explosion in occupied Crimea,\" said one Twitter user.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nEverything points to a forgery. The number of the ID card in the lower right-hand corner consists entirely of zeros, just as it does on Ukrainian ID card samples. Online copies of these samples are easily found on Wikipedia and elsewhere. Additionally, the signature and the expiry date on the ID card of the alleged perpetrator are identical to the online samples. Furthermore, the upper chest of the person in the photo is naked, which would hardly have been acceptable to any authority. Also, the spelling of the surname in English does not follow tnhe Ukrainian rules for transliterating names into the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe fake ID portraying the US comedian Sam Hyde has been repeatedly circulated by trolls\n\nWhen DW's fact checking team performed a reverse image search of the ID, it found older posts on social networks that used the ID in other contexts. Sometimes the ID was said to show a fallen Azov leader, in other cases it was linked to the death of Daria Dugina, the daughter of Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. Many hits lead to meme pages.\n\nThe photo on the ID is actually of US comedian Sam Hyde.

        "doc": "The viral video shared as a warning against Covid-19 from 1956 was actually created in 2020, intended to be a satire. (Photo: Video grab) Globally, more than 100 vaccines are being tested and developed in a bid to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 11 lakh people worldwide and ravaged the global economy. The devastation caused by the pandemic this year has also been surrounded by an onslaught of fake news and conspiracy theories. Amidst it, a one-minute 58-second video purportedly from 1956 is also viral on social media. It is being said that the video, made almost 65 years ago, was a warning against the novel Covid-19 pandemic that is plaguing the world right now. The caption to one such video that combines multiple black and white frames reads, \"This recording was made on 29/2/1956. i.e. 64 years ago. Listen especially to the last 40 seconds of recording for a great surprise or shock.\" India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is misleading. The video was not made in 1956. It was made in 2020 as a satire in response to misinformation surrounding Covid-19. The extract from the voiceover played throughout the video is as follows, \"When you think about the future, you probably envision the remarkable technologies you've seen in comics and movies. You may be surprised to learn what the future really could bring...\" Further in the video one can hear, \"Perhaps worst of all will be the emergence of a deadly and potentially devastating disease Experts predict that by the year 2020, a new virus will rise, spreading from somewhere in Asia to the rest of the world...\" The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here, here, here and here. AFWA probe With the help of the InVid tool and reverse image search, we found the oldest version of the same video was uploaded on March 1, 2020, on a YouTube channel named RamsesThePigeon. The title of the video reads- 1950s PSA: \"Avoiding the Future Plague\" The description of the video says the clippings in the video were gathered from various public domains and the digital library - Archive.org. \"It's hilarious to look back on what people from the 1950s thought the future would be like! Archival and public domain footage was acquired from Archive.org. Also, yes, I only threw this together because I wanted to have a video upload on February 29th,\" reads the description to the video. A satire built around Covid-19 conspiracy theories Further search led us to a Twitter handle with the same name - RamsesThePigeon. On October 6, 2020, the handle had posted a Reddit link to an AMA (Ask Me Anything) with the caption, \"In response to my \"Avoiding the Future Plague\" piece going viral, I'm hosting an AMA on Reddit:\" In response to my \"Avoiding the Future Plague\" piece going viral, I'm hosting an AMA on Reddit:https://t.co/tffXWX8oqB? \u2014 Ramses the Pigeon (@RamsesThePigeon) October 6, 2020 The headline of the AMA reads as follows. \"I AmA writer, absurdist, and satirist who recently started a viral misinformation campaign by accident. You might know me as RamsesThePigeon. AMA!\" Hyperlinking the video in question, the person wrote that the video is a satire piece created shortly after Covid-19 started to spread. He also wrote that the video is to be recognized as a genuine threat and was \"intended to lampoon the anti-science perspectives which were arising at the time.\" The person further pointed out, in the following months of creating the video, that parts of the video were, \"ripped, cut, and shared across a variety of social media sites.\" \"Worse still, many of those individuals insisted that they were presenting \"proof\" of the pandemic having been intentionally engineered,\" the person adds. With the help of a website link provided in the Twitter bio of Ramses the Pigeon and Linkedin, we also found that the \"Ramses the Pigeon\" is the pseudonym of author and satirist Max Patrick Schlienger, who lives in the United States. Also, in an email interview with AFP which has earlier fact-checked the viral video, Max has confirmed that the video was made by him in response to the conspiracy theories surrounding Covid-19. Max also said he wrote and recorded the voiceover himself and the clippings used in the video are from a collection of public domain educational videos, commercials, and horror films from the 1950s. Hence it is clear that the viral video shared as a warning against Covid-19 from 1956 was actually created in 2020, intended to be a satire. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Viral video shows a public service announcement from 1956 warning about the Covid-19 pandemic plaguing the world in 2020. Conclusion The video was made in early 2020 in response to the conspiracy theories surrounding Covid-19. It was intended to be satirical.

        "doc": "Versions of this post\u2014about what French President Emmanuel Macron is demanding if the UK wants to stay in the EU\u2014have been shared over 16,000 times on Facebook. We can find no evidence that Mr Macron has said any of these things. The claims in the post about what the UK would be forced to do if it stayed in the EU are incorrect. The French Embassy in London confirmed to us that Mr Macron said none of these things . \"the UK will only be allowed to stay in the EU if they fully adopt all EU rules and regulations including adopting the Euro with 6 months of stopping Brexit\" We can find no evidence that Mr Macron has said anything like this. If the UK remained in the EU we would of course have to continue following EU law. Following EU rules and regulations is a necessary part of membership of the EU and we signed up to this principle in 1972. There are certain areas of EU regulation that the UK has opted out of. One of these areas is membership of the Euro currency. If we remained in the EU, we would retain all of our opt-outs. The treaty governing the UK's opt-out of the Euro says \"the United Kingdom shall not be obliged or committed to adopt the euro without a separate decision to do so by its government and parliament\". \"The UK must take its share of migrants, 300,000 now immediately and up to 100,000 every year until the situation is resolved.\" We can find no evidence that Mr Macron has said this, and it's incorrect. There is no demand on Britain to take 300,000 migrants if it remains in the EU. Nor is this demand made of any other EU member states. \"The UK must pay in full the costs involved for all other member states for Brexit, currently 39 billion euros.\" Again, there is no evidence Macron ever said this, and it's incorrect. \u00a339 billion is the estimated cost of the \" divorce bill \" we would pay the EU as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It covers things like payments to the EU budget until 2020, and other outstanding commitments and liabilities we have towards the EU until 2064. If we remained in the EU, we would pay our membership fee each year which would cover all these things. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on 10 December that the UK can revoke its Article 50 notification by itself, without requiring the agreement of other EU member states. This means that there is no clear mechanism by which other member states could impose new conditions, such as the ones suggested in this claim, on the UK for remaining in the EU.",

        "doc": "(UPDATED) Luis \u201cChavit\u201d Singson, mayor of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur and a staunch ally of Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr., claimed that the funds deposited in Swiss bank accounts of the presidential candidate\u2019s family and recovered by the Philippine government in 2003 are \u201clawfully theirs.\u201d This is false. STATEMENT In an interview with Christian Esguerra, anchor of ABS-CBN News Channel\u2019s program After the Fact, Singson said the Marcoses have long been bombarded by \u201callegations\u201d of ill-gotten wealth. Esguerra then mentioned the 2003 ruling of the Supreme Court (SC), which found that over $650 million in the Marcoses\u2019 Swiss bank deposits were \u201cunlawfully acquired.\u201d Singson replied: \u201cAng diperensya diyan, sinasabi na kasi na ninakaw (ang $650 million). Hindi naman ninakaw eh. Sa kanila \u2018yun eh. \u2018Yun ang diperensya.\u201d (The problem there is, they\u2019ve been saying these were stolen. They were not stolen. That\u2019s theirs.

Source: watch from 15:59 to 16:05 FACT In 2003, the SC, citing \u201cundeniable circumstances\u201d and \u201can avalanche of documentary evidence,\u201d ruled that the Marcoses failed to \u201cjustify the lawful nature of their acquisition\u201d of the money in Swiss banks transferred to the Philippine National Bank. The court ordered the forfeiture of these deposits, by then valued at $658,175,373.60. The magistrates based their decision on three grounds: the offender was a public official; he must have acquired a considerable amount of money or property during his incumbency; and, the amount is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as a public servant and other lawful income, plus income from legitimately acquired properties. The SC noted that the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and his wife, Imelda, \u201cadmittedly owned\u201d five account groups in Swiss banks amounting to $356 million, which was \u201cway, way beyond their aggregate legitimate income\u201d as government officials, calculated at only $304,372.43 from 1966 to 1986. The magistrates explained: \u201cConsidering, therefore, that the total amount of the Swiss deposits was considerably out of proportion to the known lawful income of the Marcoses, the presumption that said dollar deposits were unlawfully acquired was duly established.\u201d Under Section 9 of the Presidential Commission on Good Government\u2019s rules and regulations: \u201cAny accumulation of assets, properties, and other material possessions of those persons covered by Executive Orders No. 1 and No. 2, whose value is out of proportion to their known lawful income is prima facie deemed ill-gotten wealth.\u201d At least three other SC rulings affirmed the forfeiture of the Marcoses\u2019 ill-gotten wealth and transferred its ownership to the Republic of the Philippines.

        "claim": "A recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats \"say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government.\"",
        "doc": "Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., isn\u2019t as well known nationally as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, or Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. -- two lawmakers who are weighing presidential bids in 2016. But like Cruz and Paul, Blackburn recently trekked to Manchester, N.H., to address the New Hampshire Freedom Summit, a gathering sponsored by the conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United. In her speech on April 12, 2014, Blackburn -- like many of her fellow speakers -- took aim at the government and earned applause from the staunch conservatives in the audience. \"Gallup did a survey recently,\" she said, \"and what they found was that 72 percent of all Americans say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government. That is amazing. Now, the really fascinating part of this is 56 percent of all Democrats say the biggest threat to our nation is big government. Now I\u2019ve got to tell you something -- when the Democrats say the government is too big, we all know the government is too big.\" We wondered whether it was true that Gallup found that 72 percent of Americans, and 56 percent of Democrats, \"say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government.\" We didn\u2019t hear back from Blackburn\u2019s office, but we quickly found the study she was referring to. It was a poll taken in early December 2013, which we think qualifies as \"recent.\" It has a sampling error of 4 percentage points. The survey asked the Gallup question that\u2019s been asked with identical wording since 1965: \"Which of the following will be the biggest threat to the country in the future -- big business, big labor or big government?\" Gallup reported that 72 percent of all respondents said \"big government,\" calling it \"a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question. The prior high for big government was 65 percent in 1999 and 2000. Big government has always topped big business and big labor, including in the initial asking in 1965, but just 35 percent named it at that time.\" In the December 2013 version of the poll question, Blackburn\u2019s percentages were on target. Here\u2019s the breakdown by party: Party of survey respondent Big government is biggest threat Big business is biggest threat Big labor is biggest threat Republican 92 percent 4 percent 3 percent Independent 71 percent 20 percent 5 percent Democratic 56 percent 36 percent 6 percent All respondents 72 percent 21 percent 5 percent Gallup said it expects the results to continue to fluctuate as it asks the question periodically, since both parties tend to be more suspicious of government whenever the opposite party controls the White House. In general, though, Republicans have long been more wary of big government, the data shows. Democratic concern about big government maxed out at 62 percent in 2005, during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency -- a high level, but much lower than the GOP\u2019s current 92 percent rate. But what about Blackburn\u2019s talking point? Gallup\u2019s question gave respondents one of three choices -- big government, big business and big labor. Blackburn didn\u2019t mention that framing, and that\u2019s an important distinction to make. We think most listeners, when hearing someone cite results of a poll about \"the biggest threat to our nation's security\" and \"the biggest threat to our nation,\" would assume that respondents were choosing from a larger universe of possible threats. Yet the way the question was worded prevented respondents from considering any number of possible threats to the nation\u2019s security, ranging from radical Islamism to climate change to a weak economy. Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, a professor of law and public policy and director of the Marquette Law School Poll, agrees that there\u2019s a disconnect between the poll question Gallup asked and the way Blackburn framed it. \"The Gallup question is not specific as to the nature of the possible threat, and seems to imply one of these three should be selected,\" he said. \"The reason for the threat, or its nature, would almost certainly vary across partisans and lead to very different conclusions as to what should be done.\" For instance, a CBS News poll taken in March 2014 asked, \"What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?\" It left the question open-ended for the respondent to answer. The economy and jobs finished first with 30 percent, followed by health care with 7 percent, the budget with 5 percent, \"President Obama\" with 4 percent, and four topics with 3 percent -- immigration, education, \"miscellaneous government issues\" and religious values. No fewer than 37 percent split their answers among other topics in segments smaller than 3 percent. The economy topped the list in several other versions of the CBS News question asked over the previous year. And Gallup itself has asked a similar open-ended question as well, most recently in June 2013. The question was, \"Looking ahead, what is your greatest worry or concern about the future of the United States?\" The economy finished first with 17 percent, followed by \"the debt/deficit/nation\u2019s finances\" with 11 percent, \"employment/jobs\" with 11 percent, and \"wars/conflicts in other countries\" with 5 percent. The closest category to \"big government\" in this poll was \"government not working for the betterment of the people,\" with 4 percent, and government \"overreach/power\" with 3 percent. Combined, these two categories drew a distinct minority of respondents -- 7 percent, a far cry from the 72 percent \"consensus\" found in the more limited-question poll Blackburn cited. Our ruling Blackburn said a recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats \"say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government.\" She got the numbers right, but the specific poll only offered respondents three options: \"big government,\" \"big business\" or \"big labor.\" Her phrasing gives the misleading impression that there is wide consensus -- even among Democrats -- that \"big government\" is the biggest threat to the nation\u2019s security. Other polls, including Gallup\u2019s own, show that when respondents are asked an open-ended question, other issues such as the economy rise to the top of the list. So Blackburn is essentially cherry-picking among polls. Blackburn\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "Sherrod Brown \"voted six times to raise his own pay.\"",
        "doc": "As he campaigns to unseat Sen. Sherrod Brown, Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer, has worked to paint the Democratic incumbent as a free-spending Washington insider.A recent TV ad for Mandel follows that line by saying that Brown \"voted six times to raise his own pay.\"PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out that claim, expecting it would be a straightforward, but instead found it illustrates the daunting complexity of the legislative process.First, some background.Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution requires Congress to determine its own pay. It can use specific legislation to raise the pay.But there is a limitation on that created by the 27th Amendment of the Constitution, which was ratified in 1992. It says: \"No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.\"In other words, members of Congress can change the pay of the next Congress, but not their own.Seems simple enough. But, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reports -- the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 created an automatic annual cost of living adjustment.The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for members not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatically included in appropriations bills, with raises for other federal employees. So the law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system in which pay for members of Congress can increase without members having to cast a straight up or down vote on the raise.Because the pay raises are essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is vote to stop them. There are roll call votes on whether members of Congress were willing to hear amendments to suspend their pay increases. And it is those procedural votes that the Mandel ad relies on for support.Now, some specifics.The first of the votes cited by the Mandel campaign in support of its claim was one Brown cast July 17, 1996 -- when he was a member of the House of Representatives -- on the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal 1997.Brown voted \"no\" on the $23.1 billion bill, which included a pay-freeze provision to deny the automatic pay increase.\"Therefore,\" Mandel's campaign told us, \"he voted in favor of a pay increase.\"But wait.Brown's campaign, responding to the Mandel ad, said that Brown \"has voted against pay increases at least seven times.\" The first instance it cited was Brown's vote in favor of the provision denying the pay increase on July 16, 1996 -- the day before the vote on the appropriations bill.Did Brown's \"no\" vote on the appropriations bill the next day cancel that out?Not exactly. According to the Congressional Research Service, the House-passed version of the appropriations bill (H.R. 3756) was sent to conference with the Senate and was incorporated into H.R. 3610, the Omnibus Continuing Appropriations Act for fiscal 1997.The omnibus spending act included the provision denying the automatic pay raise -- and Brown voted in favor of the act when it was passed in final action by the House on Sept. 28, 1996.So using the reasoning applied in the TV ad, Brown actually voted against giving Congress a pay increase.Here\u2019s the other examples the Mandel camp cited in support of the ad claim:1997: On Sept. 24, 1997, Brown joined the majority as the House voted to \"order the previous question\" on a motion to instruct conferees (participants in the budget conference committee with the Senate) on an issue unrelated to a pay freeze. Because the House permits only one motion to instruct conferees, the Congressional Research Service said, \"this vote in effect foreclosed the possibility of instructing conferees to omit the pay adjustment from the conference report.\" As a result, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill did not include a pay freeze.1998: On Oct. 7, 1998, Brown voted in the minority against the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act for fiscal 1999, which included a provision blocking the pay raise. On Oct. 20, however, he voted with the majority in favor of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which had the provision stopping the pay raise.2000: On July 20, 2000, Brown voted with the House majority on \"ordering the previous question\" on a rule to consider the fiscal 2001 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The vote had the effect of not allowing a pay-freeze amendment, and \"was seen by some as a vote to accept a pay adjustment,\" the Congressional Research Service said.2002: On July 18, 2002, Brown voted with the House majority to order the previous question on House Resolution 488, which prevented consideration of an amendment to stop the cost-of-living raise, and allowed consideration of H.R. 5120, the fiscal 2003 Treasury Appropriations bill. The vote \"was seen by some as a vote to accept a pay adjustment,\" the CRS said.2012: The final example cited by the Mandel campaign was Brown's vote in the Senate last March against one of the many amendments proposed to the Senate highway transportation bill. The amendment would have extended the current 2-year pay freeze on the federal workforce of about 2 million, including members of Congress, to help pay for a wide range of tax deductions and credits. But the amendment also included more-controversial items. It would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, approved construction of the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and mandated a huge expansion of offshore oil-and-gas leasing.What's the take-home on the ad's claim?The Constitution doesn't permit members of Congress to raise their own pay. The raises cannot take effect until after an election selects a new Congress.Congress, though, essentially built a system, before Brown arrived, that allows for pay raises without direct votes by members. That can make it difficult to say who voted for or against raises, which were a tiny part of much larger appropriation bills.Mandel's ad exaggerates when it cites six votes to say that Brown voted six times to raise his own pay. The votes cited by the Mandel camp were procedural in nature that didn\u2019t raise the pay on their own. In two of the six cases cited, later votes on those same spending bills could be seen as Brown votes against pay raises.And in the most recent case cited, it is misleading to characterize Brown's no vote as a vote to raise the pay for Congress given the other issues that were involved. The vote came on an amendment that contained wide-ranging and unrelated provisions that had been hot points for debate.As PolitiFact Ohio has noted previously, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against something they might normally support because it is included in wide-ranging legislation that also has other provisions they cannot support.In the case of these cited procedural votes, all involved broad pieces of legislation. None were focused purely on the pay raise issue.The Mandel ad claimed that Brown voted six times to raise his own pay. On the Truth-O-Meter, that claim rates False.",

        "claim": "The folding of a U.S. flag traditionally incorporates thirteen separate folds because each of the folds has a special meaning.",
        "doc": "A much-shared item about the meanings of the folds in a flag reminds us of a joke told by deadpan comedian Steven Wright: \u201cWhy is the alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song?\u201d As often happens, a \u201cmeaning\u201d has been grafted onto some facet of everyday life, to the point that a symbolic and after-the-fact meaning has been confused with an original purpose: Have you ever wondered why the Flag of the United States of America is folded 13 times when it is lowered or when it is folded and handed to the next of kin at the burial of a veteran? Here is the meaning of each of those folds and what it means: The first fold of our Flag is a symbol of life. The second fold is a symbol of our belief in eternal life. The third fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veterans departing our ranks who gave a portion of their lives for the defense of our country to attain peace throughout the world. The fourth fold represents our weaker nature, for as American citizens trusting, it is to Him we turn in times of peace as well as in time of war for His divine guidance. The fifth fold is a tribute to our country, for in the words of Stephen Decatur, \u201cOur Country, in dealing with other countries may she always be right; but it is still our country, right or wrong.\u201d The sixth fold is for where our hearts lie. It is with our heart that we pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. The seventh fold is a tribute to our Armed Forces, for it is through the Armed Forces that we protect our country and our flag against all her enemies, whether they be found within or without the boundaries of our Republic. The eighth fold is a tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day, and to honor mother, for whom it flies on Mother\u2019s Day. The ninth fold is a tribute to womanhood; for it has been through their faith, their love, loyalty and devotion that the character of the men and women who have made this country great has been molded. The tenth fold is a tribute to the father, for he, too, has given his sons and daughters for the defense of our country since they were first born. The eleventh fold, in the eyes of a Hebrew citizen represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon, and glorifies in their eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The twelfth fold, in the eyes of a Christian citizen, represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies, in their eyes, God the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit. The thirteenth fold: When the Flag is completely folded, the stars are uppermost reminding us of our Nation\u2019s motto, \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d After the Flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a cocked hat, ever reminding us of the soldiers who served under General George Washington, and the Sailors and Marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones, who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the Armed Forces of the United States, preserving for us the rights, privileges, and freedoms we enjoy today. The next time you see a Flag ceremony honoring someone that has served our country, either in the Armed Forces or in our civilian services such as the Police Force or Fire Department, keep in mind all the important reasons behind each and every movement. They have paid the ultimate sacrifice for all of us by honoring our Flag and our Country. Traditional flag etiquette prescribes that before an American flag is stored or presented, its handlers should twice fold it in half lengthwise; then (from the end opposite the blue field) make a triangular fold, continuing to fold it in triangles until the other end is reached. This makes a triangular \u201cpillow\u201d of the flag with only the blue starred field showing on the outside, and it takes thirteen folds to produce: two lengthwise folds and eleven triangular ones. The American flag isn\u2019t folded in this manner because each of the folds has a special symbolic meaning; the flag is folded this way because it provides a dignified ceremonial touch that distinguishes folding a flag from folding an ordinary object such as a bedsheet, and because it results a visually pleasing, easy-to-handle shape. This thirteen-fold procedure was a common practice long before the creation of a ceremonial assignation of \u201cmeaning\u201d to each of the steps. An elaborate flag folding ceremony incorporating these meanings has since been devised for special occasions such as Memorial Day and Veterans Day. These associations are \u201creal\u201d in the sense that they mean something to the people who participate in the ceremony, but they are not the reason why a flag is folded in the traditional thirteen-step manner. As was the case with the candy cane, an invented (religious) symbolism has become so widespread that it is now often mistakenly assumed to have been an integral part of the origins of the item it is associated with. It is also a common misbelief that the above-quoted script originated with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and is used by default at all veterans\u2019 funerals conducted under the aegis of the U.S. military. This is not the case, as the USAF has noted: Though there are no official ceremonies in the Air Force that require a script to be read when a flag is folded, unofficial ceremonies such as retirements often do, said Lt. Col. Samuel Hudspath, Air Force protocol chief. \u201cWe have had a tradition within the Air Force of individuals requesting that a flag be folded, with words, at their retirement ceremony,\u201d he said. There is no shortage of scripts available that can be read aloud during a flag folding, but many of those scripts are religious in nature and also ascribe meaning to the individual folds put into the flag. One of the oldest of those scripts is attributed to an anonymous chaplain at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Individuals who hear those scripts end up attributing the contents of the script to the U.S. Air Force. But the reality is that neither Congress, nor federal laws related to the flag, assign any special meaning to the individual folds.",

        "claim": "Photo shows Lady Gaga attending the 2023 Met Gala",
        "doc": "\"LADY GAGA IS NOW ON THE RED CARPET IN CUSTOM CHANEL #MetGala,\" says a tweet shared May 1, 2023, as one of the year's top fashion events was underway at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Pictures and videos of Gaga wearing the same white dress spread in other tweets -- including one from a page impersonating the celebrity-focused account \"Pop Base.\" The photos also gathered tens of thousands of interactions on Instagram and TikTok. The theme for this year's gala, organized by Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, was \"In honor of Karl,\" paying homage to the Chanel designer who died February 19, 2019. Despite posts claiming otherwise, Gaga did not attend this year's event -- the image shared online has been digitally manipulated. The pop star does not appear in Vogue's livestream or in an article that includes a full list of looks. AFP's extensive coverage of the event also does not mention Gaga. A reverse image search surfaced the original photo of Gaga in the white dress, which photographer Amanda Schwab took November 21, 2011. \"Singer Lady Gaga appears at a ribbon cutting ceremony to launch Gaga's Workshop, a holiday retail experience representing Lady Gaga's reinterpretation of Santa's workshop at Barneys department store in New York,\" the caption says. Her silhouette was added on top of a photo of K-pop star Jennie Kim at the 2023 Met Gala. Gaga is a crowd favorite on the Met's red carpet. She last attended the event in 2019 when she co-chaired the gala. Other celebrities have also been the subject of manipulated images. \"Zendaya arrives at the 2023 #MetGala,\" says a May 1 tweet sharing an image of the \"Euphoria\" star. The same claim also circulated in Spanish. But Zendaya's face was added to British singer Rita Ora's body. The original, unflipped version of the picture was taken by Getty Images photographer Mike Coppola. Another May 1 tweet claims Selena Gomez made \"A SURPRISE APPEARANCE AT THE #MetGala.\" In this case, the accompanying image appears to be altered from photos of Lily James at the 2022 Met Gala. As with Gaga, AFP photos and videos confirm neither star was present on the red carpet this year. AFP has previously fact-checked other claims about Lady Gaga and high-profile celebrity events.",

        "claim": "Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased.",
        "doc": "President Barack Obama and Congress are in intense discussions on raising the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. But the negotiations aren't going so well, leaving observers -- and some participants -- to consider whether there are Plan B's, Plan C's and Plan D's if the negotiators can't reach an agreement in time. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure that bought time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. While most if not all federal accounts are affected in some way by the debt limit debate, the most urgent items for many ordinary Americans are direct transfer payments, most notably Social Security and veterans' benefits. Obama was asked about this in a July 12, 2011, interview with CBS News anchor Scott Pelley. Here's their exchange: Pelley: \"Can you tell the folks at home that, no matter what happens, the Social Security checks are going to go out on August the 3rd? There are about $20 billion worth of Social Security checks that have to go out the day after the government is supposedly going to go into default.\" Obama: \"Well, this is not just a matter of Social Security checks. These are veterans' checks, these are folks on disability and their checks. There are about 70 million checks that go out each month.\" Pelley: \"Can you guarantee, as president, that those checks will go out on August the 3rd?\" Obama: \"I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue, because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it.\" We heard from a lot of readers who wanted us to check whether that statement was factually accurate or if Obama was using scare tactics. Back in February, we examined a similar statement by Obama -- that if there's a government shutdown, \"people don't get their Social Security checks.\" We rated that Barely True. Social Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund, so Social Security benefits don't have to be formally approved by Congress every year. However, Social Security Administration employees are paid through appropriated funds. The real question about a government shutdown was whether those employees would be kept from going to work and if so, whether the checks would sit idle rather than arriving in mailboxes nationwide. The rules that cover government shutdowns provide some leeway for federal workers to carry out core Social Security functions. This flexibility allowed checks to go out during a 1995 shutdown, even as less-urgent agency functions lagged. However, the two scenarios -- a government shutdown caused by the absence of funding approved by Congress and a debt ceiling impasse that prevents new borrowing -- are different. So the consequences of one do not necessarily match the consequences of the other. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, put it this way: \"Failing to raise the debt ceiling would not bring the government to a screeching halt the way that not passing appropriations bills would. Employees would not be sent home, and checks would continue to be issued. If the Treasury was low on cash, however, there could be delays in honoring checks and disruptions in the normal flow of government services.\" This is because the government receives both cash, including tax revenue, and bills at irregular intervals. So it doesn't always have enough cash on hand to pay all its debts at any given moment. (Families and businesses will recognize this as the always-dreaded \"cash flow problem.\") The Treasury Department has argued that failure to raise the debt limit actually would have more dramatic consequences than a government shutdown. \"If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, the government would have to stop, limit, or delaypayments on a broad range of legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and many other commitments,\" the department said in a statement. How broad would the impact be? The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached. When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion. With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments, and we'll say more on that later -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion), and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion. But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion), and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion). If the government could prioritize payments to creditors it deemed most important -- bondholders, say, or Social Security beneficiaries -- it could be a viable stopgap, at least for the favored creditors. But does the government have the power to prioritize whom it pays? The answer is somewhat in dispute. Here's how CRS describes it: \"Some have argued that prioritization of payments can be used by Treasury to avoid a default on federal obligations by paying interest on outstanding debt before other obligations,\" CRS wrote in a study published earlier this year. \"Treasury officials have maintained that the department lacks formal legal authority to establish priorities to pay obligations, asserting, in effect, that each law obligating funds and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing. In other words, Treasury would have to make payments on obligations as they come due.\" But CRS added that this view contrasts with one expressed by the Government Accountability Office in 1985 (when the office, the auditing arm of Congress, was known as the General Accounting Office). The GAO found \"no requirement\" that Treasury pay its bills in a first-in, first-out fashion. \"Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States,\" the GAO concluded. Even if the government has the authority to prioritize payments such as Social Security checks, doing so would still entail some downsides, and some of these might be considered politically or practically untenable. Doing so merely kicks certain payments down the road, where they may accrue additional interest charges, worsening an already difficult fiscal climate. \"A backlog of unpaid bills would continue to grow until the government collects more revenues or other sources of cash than its outlays,\" CRS wrote. \"In some cases, delaying federal payments incurs interest penalties under some statutes such as the Prompt Payment Act, which directs the government to pay interest penalties to contractors if it does not pay them by the required payment date, and the Internal Revenue Code, which requires the government to pay interest penalties if tax refunds are delayed beyond a certain date.\" Even if payments to bondholders were prioritized, the bond market may still be spooked by the delays in other federal payments, risking harm to the nation's creditworthiness. \"If the federal government were to prioritize payments on debt obligations above other obligations, it is not clear whether financial markets would find this distinction to be significant when deciding whether and how to invest in federal government Treasury securities,\" CRS wrote. CRS added, \"if creditors lost this confidence, the federal government\u2019s interest costs would likely increase substantially, and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets.\" Delaying certain payments, even while making others, could ripple through the economy and drag down already weak economic growth. \"Removing a portion of government spending from the economy would leave behind significant economic effects and would have an effect on\" gross domestic product, CRS wrote. There are also some specific technical challenges for shifting funding into and out of the Social Security Trust Fund, which our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker column looked into here. Most of the experts we interviewed agreed that the federal government, if push came to shove, could probably find a way to prioritize Social Security or other payments, though none expressed absolute certainty. However, most of the experts also acknowledged practical challenges of using such tactics. While he thinks the GAO's green light for payment prioritization carries significant weight, Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute added that \"with so much being borrowed, it is hard simply to pick on a few programs\" to continue in the face of a debt ceiling impasse. Ronald M. Levin, a professor at the Washington University School of Law said, \"I interpret the president to be saying, 'Stopping Social Security checks would be hugely costly, but other curtailments would also be hugely costly. ... Something will have to give, and I cannot responsibly guarantee that it won\u2019t be Social Security.' That is not quite what he said, but to my mind it\u2019s close.\" Where does this leave us? The critics likely have a point when they say Obama is playing up the risk to the most sympathetic potential victims -- Social Security recipients, 23 percent of whom live in households that depend on the retirement system for 90 percent or more of their income. While it's not a certainty that the Obama administration could prioritize cutting checks to seniors, there's a reasonable shot that the administration could do it. On the other hand, doing so would likely cause a lot of collateral damage to other American creditors, federal workers, students, Pentagon vendors and countless others -- and could also hamper the broader economy at a particularly sensitive time. The president is probably justified in saying that the possibility of an un-raised debt ceiling jeopardizes Social Security checks -- after all, it hasn't happened before, so no one knows for sure. But we also think the president probably has tools at his disposal to avoid the worst-case scenario for seniors that he expresses concern about. Acknowledging that there are a lot of uncertainties, we rate his statement Half True.",

        "claim": "Says that during the first 19 months of the Obama administration, the U.S. detained people from nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism on the southwestern border.",
        "doc": "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, came to a committee hearing on homeland security armed with statistics about the nation\u2019s southwestern border. Confronting Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on March 9, Cornyn cited information that he said was from the Border Patrol about people from countries other than Mexico who have been detained near the southwestern border for illegally entering the United States. Cornyn said there were about 45,000 arrests of people from 140 different countries, excluding Mexico, in the 19 months between the start of the 2009 fiscal year \u2014 Oct. 1, 2008 \u2014 and April 30, 2010. At least four of those nations \"have been designated by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism,\" Cornyn said. \"How can you possibly claim that the approach of the administration is working when it comes to border security, in light of these statistics?\" He made a similar point the next day while questioning National Intelligence Director James Clapper at another hearing. \"Would you agree with me, Director Clapper, that an individual with enough money and enough determination can penetrate our southwestern border and make their way into the United States \u2026 and that that does represent a potential terrorist threat to the United States?\" Cornyn asked. Clapper\u2019s response: \"Yes, sir. I don't \u2014 I don't pretend, nor would, I don't think, Secretary Napolitano pretend that, you know, we've got an iron-clad perfect system.\" We wondered whether Cornyn was right. Did the U.S. Border Patrol arrest people on the Mexico border who were from nations that the U.S. labels state sponsors of terrorism? On the State Department\u2019s website, we found that the only nations currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism are Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. \"State sponsors of terrorism provide critical support to many non-state terrorist groups,\" says a 2009 department report on terrorism. \"Without state sponsors, these groups would have greater difficulty obtaining the funds, weapons, materials, and secure areas they require to plan and conduct operations.\" Next, we looked into Border Patrol apprehensions near the southwestern border. We found that nearly all are of Mexican nationals, according to information the agency publishes on its website. In fiscal 2009, their 495,582 arrests accounted for 92 percent of the total. The rest of the apprehensions on the Mexican border are of people from countries other than Mexico. The Border Patrol, which is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the Homeland Security Department, publishes data on how many of those occur \u2014 but not by individual country. According to that information, there were 45,283 arrests of individuals from nations other than Mexico in fiscal 2009 and 50,912 in fiscal 2010. (It appears that Cornyn quoted only the fiscal 2009 number during the hearing.) In Homeland Security lingo, an \"apprehension\" is an arrest for being in the United States illegally. However, the number of people actually detained is smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once, according to a June 2009 fact sheet published by the department\u2019s Office of Immigration Statistics. As support for the senator\u2019s statement during the March 9 hearing, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie sent us a chart that he said his office had received from Customs and Border Protection. Unlike the Border Patrol\u2019s published data, this chart lists a country-by-country breakdown of arrests \"by citizenship\" for illegal entry on the southwestern border during fiscal 2009 and the first seven months of fiscal 2010. That\u2019s the same time period that Cornyn noted at the March 9 hearing. The southwestern border data from Cornyn\u2019s chart show that there were 105 apprehensions of Cubans, 10 of Iranians, six of Sudanese and none of Syrians in fiscal 2009. In the first seven months of 2010, there were 48 apprehensions of Cubans, seven of Iranians, one of Sudanese and two of Syrians. All together, the apprehensions from those four countries represent 0.25 percent of the total arrests of non-Mexicans on the southwestern border over the 19-month period, according to Cornyn\u2019s chart. (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras alone accounted for 84 percent.) Add Mexican nationals to the equation, and the percentage shrinks more: According to the numbers in Cornyn\u2019s chart, apprehensions of people from the \"state sponsor of terrorism\" nations amounted to 0.02 percent of the 540,865 total arrests on the southwestern border in fiscal 2009. What about the other U.S. border areas? The Border Patrol also apprehends people for illegal entry at the northern border with Canada and in the coastal areas of Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana and other Gulf states. According to 2009 nationwide statistics that we received from the Border Patrol, there were 935 arrests of people from the four \"terrorism\" nations: 910 of Cubans, 15 of Iranians, six of Sudanese and four of Syrians. Subtract the 121 apprehensions that took place on the southwestern border that year, according to Cornyn\u2019s chart, and that leaves 814 arrests, mostly of Cubans. So, 87 percent of the apprehensions of citizens from terrorism-sponsoring countries occurred away from the southwestern border. We asked the Border Patrol to confirm the information in Cornyn\u2019s chart, but the agency declined. \"For operational integrity and intelligence-based targeting, the Border Patrol does not specifically list country of birth to the location of apprehension,\" Border Patrol spokesman Mark Qualia said. To try to verify that the data were authentic, we asked Cornyn\u2019s office to show us the accompanying e-mail from the agency; Brandewie declined. For a fact-checking outfit, that\u2019s an impasse. However, Border Patrol statistics that the agency either publishes online or confirmed for us lend statistical support to Cornyn\u2019s claim. For instance: The vast majority of apprehensions of people from countries other than Mexico occur on the southwestern border, 86 percent in fiscal 2009. So it\u2019s statistically likely that some of the apprehensions of people from countries that sponsor terrorism take place there, too. And while total nationwide Border Patrol apprehensions have dropped 72 percent over the past decade, arrests of people from nations other than Mexico increased 49 percent. Have arrests of people from the \"state sponsor of terrorism\" nations also gone up? Not as far as we can tell. We asked the Border Patrol for a country-by-country breakdown for fiscal 2005, midway through the Bush administration and one of the peak years for total apprehensions in the past decade, as well as other years. All we received was the data for 2005, when six nations had the \"terrorism\" label: Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Nationwide in 2005, there were 3,309 apprehensions of people from terrorism-sponsoring countries out of a total of 1,189,000. That compares to the 935 apprehensions in 2009 out of a total of 556,041. In fiscal 2010, the nationwide apprehensions of people from the four terrorism-sponsoring countries dropped again, to 736. What of Cornyn\u2019s larger argument: that the arrests of people from Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria show that the federal government\u2019s approach to security on the southwestern border is not working and that the border is vulnerable to penetration by terrorists crossing illegally? We\u2019re not going to tackle the first point, which is a political bone of contention. We\u2019re also mindful of the logic that any arrests are evidence that border security efforts are working. But we wanted to find out whether there is evidence of would-be terrorists entering the U.S. illegally through Mexico. Matthew Chandler, press secretary for the Homeland Security Department, told us that \"at this time, DHS does not have any credible information on terrorist groups operating along the southwest border.\" Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, echoed that thought in a March 17 Texas Tribune news article, saying that the State Department\u2019s most recent report on terrorism gave no indication that Mexico has become a launch pad for terrorists crossing the border illegally. \"I suppose anyone that hates the U.S. would find a way to get in,\" he told the Tribune. \"But so far, most of the cases (of those visitors who have sought to harm the U.S.) have been overstayed visas. They come in through the front door, not the back door.\" David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute, which studies border-related topics such as the cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico on security initiatives, told us that although the U.S. has been arresting people at the border from countries associated with terrorism, that doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that those individuals were would-be terrorists. But Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, told us that Cornyn\u2019s comments are \"spot-on\" and that there is reason to be concerned about potential terrorists coming across the southwestern border. As an example, he pointed to a June 3 Stratfor assessment noting that in late May, the Homeland Security Department \"issued a lookout to authorities in Texas, warning that \u2026 (a) Somali purportedly linked to al Shabaab was believed to be in Mexico and was allegedly planning to attempt to cross the border into the United States.\" Al Shabaab, an Islamist militant group based in Somalia that has fought the nation\u2019s transitional government for years, has been on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations since early 2008. Where does that leave us? Cornyn\u2019s claim \u2014 that people from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism have been arrested on the Mexican border for illegally entering the U.S. \u2014 relies on Border Patrol statistics that the agency won\u2019t confirm or deny. However, they appear to be consistent with broader data the agency has made public. And we have no reason to question the authenticity of the information we received from Cornyn\u2019s office. But in the larger context of Cornyn\u2019s concerns about security on the Mexican border, his own numbers show that 87 percent of the apprehensions of people from \"terrorism\" countries took place elsewhere. And our spot-check found that the Border Patrol made three times as many of those arrests in 2005, during the Bush administration, than in 2009. Because Cornyn's statement leaves out key details, we rate it Half True. UPDATE, 1:00 p.m., April 11: On Friday, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed March 25, we received information from Customs and Border Protection confirming Cornyn's data on the number of apprehensions of Cubans, Iranians, Sudanese and Syrians that took place on the southwestern border between Oct. 1, 2008, and April 30, 2010.",

        "claim": "\"Of the R18 billion spent on service delivery in the City of Cape Town, R11billion is spent on the poor communities. #DAdelivers\"",
        "doc": "In February 2014, Africa Check published a column which questioned the sourcing of various pre-election claims being made on Twitter by South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). The DA's then social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the party strives to ensure that any claims its makes are accurate and added that if Africa Check \"finds that any of these statistics are inaccurate, we will gladly rectify them.\" Many of the DA's claims relate to its performance in the Western Cape, the only province in the country that is not held by the governing African National Congress. This report - the first of two on the DA - evaluates a number of key claims made by the party on Twitter using the hashtag #DADelivers. It forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on May 7 2014. Claim \"In the 2nd half of 2012/13, the WC Provincial Govt. created 60,000 work opportunities via the Expanded Public Works Projects. #DAdelivers\" Verdict incorrect The DA's former social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the claim was based on the Expanded Public Works Programme's second quarterly report for 2012/13 .  But according to that report,  68,044 work opportunities were created in the Western Cape in the first half of 2012/13, not the second half as stated in the DA's tweet. If the claim was based on the first half of the year, then it understated performance. The third and fourth quarterly reports - which cover the second half of the year - have yet to be released and it is unclear how many work opportunities were created then. Claim \"@DA_News municipalities have created 31,000 job opportunities in the past year. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven This claim appears to have first been tweeted by Gavin Davis, the DA's communications director, on 1 March 2013 . It was then recycled by the DA which tweeted it on several different dates including 18 September , 2 October , 18 November and 30 December 2013. The claim was also included in the party's 2014 election manifesto , which was launched in February 2014. It is therefore unclear whether the claim refers to a calendar year, a financial year or a specific 12 month period. If it was the latter, then - given the fact that the tweet was used on several different dates - which 12 month period did it refer to? According to the DA, the claim is supported by the Expanded Public Works Programme's second quarterly report for 2012/13 .  But that report states that 18,104 work opportunities were created in Western Cape district and metropolitan municipalities between 1 April 2012 and 30 September 2013. A further 7,491 work opportunities were created during the same period in Western Cape local municipalities. Add them together and you get a total of 25, 595. Claim \"W Cape has best delivery record in SA: 99.1% of households access piped water, 93.4% electricity & 96.9% have toilet facilities. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct According to the DA, the claim is supported by data collected during South Africa's 2011 national census . The census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water. According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng. However, when it came to accessing toilets, the Western Cape slipped from first place. According to the census, 98.9% of Gauteng households had access to a toilet. In the Western Cape 96.9% of households had access to toilets. (An earlier Africa Check report evaluated similar claims about water access made by the national government.) Claim \"The City of Cape Town delivers more to poor residents than any other city in the country. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven The DA says the claim is supported by a 2011 report on household access to basic services which was compiled by the national government's Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs. The report, which in fact used data from 2009, ranked the City of Cape Town first in the country for providing services to households. It stated that 90% of households there had achieved basic service levels and 88% had achieved higher service levels. It's important to note that the report referred to \"the levels of household access to basic service\" throughout the city and did not refer specifically to poor residents. Andre Bothma, the DA's marketing director,  told Africa Check that the claim was also supported by the City of Cape Town's Mid-Year Review (2011-2013) which stated that \"[t]he City of Cape Town has the best record of any metro in the country for providing basic services, and providing financial relief to the poor\". However, the review provided no evidence or data to support the claim and it is unclear how it arrived at its conclusion that the city had the \"best record of any metro in the country\". The 2012 non-financial census of municipalities revealed that the Western Cape has the highest percentage of households in the country receiving free basic water, electricity and sewerage and sanitation. Claim \"The [South African] gap between the 'haves' & the 'havenots' is smallest in City of Cape Town. It has the highest level of equality in SA. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct The DA based the claim on the 2010/2011 State of the World's Cities report produced by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. The report, which used the Gini coefficient to compare inequality between cities, suggested that East London and Johannesburg were some of the most unequal cities in the world. While Cape Town was found to have high levels of inequality by world standards, it was found to be the least unequal of the South African cities examined for the report.  Of the South African cities analysed, Cape Town had the lowest Gini coefficient at 0.67 while East London and Johannesburg had the highest Gini coefficients at 0.75. The 2012/2013 State of the World's Cities report found that Cape Town was a more broadly prosperous city than Johannesburg, the only other South African city examined. Claim \"Of the R18 billion spent on service delivery in the City of Cape Town, R11billion is spent on the poor communities. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven Andre Bothma, the DA's marketing director, said the claim was based on a 2012 City of Cape Town expenditure analysis. He told Africa Check the document is not publicly available. (This contradicts a statement by Molteno, the DA's former social media manager, who told us that the DA keeps a database of \"DA delivery facts, each accompanied by a reference to a source for it that is publicly available \".) Bothma also referred us to a September 2012 speech by Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille in which the claim was made. But De Lille made no reference to the source of the claim. Her spokesman, Solly Malatsi, said the claim was taken from the City of Cape Town's 2012/13 budget using \"data analytics models\". \"Using the basis of service delivery departments as the quantum of focus, we then tabulate expenditure patterns using a ward analysis of geographical income distributions in the City matched against a formula of total spending amounts to arrive at the percentage-based figure,\" he explained. Africa Check has been unable to independently verify the accuracy of claim. Claim \"80% of the R2 billion spent by the Western Cape Government on tenders during 2012/2013 was paid to #BEEbusinesses. #DAdelivers\" Verdict correct The DA says the claim is based on a Western Cape government analysis of expenditure .The analysis states that '[i]n the 2012/13 financial year, the majority of tenders over R100 000 were awarded to BEE firms. In total, bids worth R1.6 billion went to BEE firms\". This amounts to 80% of the total. Claim \"65% of the Western Cape Govt's senior management are previously disadvantaged South Africans. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven The DA claims that the tweet was sourced from the 2013 \"Western Cape Human Resource Database\". Bothma told Africa Check that the database was not publicly accessible. When asked if there were other documents that supported the claim, Bothma directed us to a Times LIVE article and a City Press article in which the Western Cape premier and DA leader, Helen Zille, claimed that \"77 percent of our 50,521 senior employees fell within the designated 'black group'\". No source for that claim was provided. We have been unable to independently verify the accuracy of the claim. Claim \"76% of the Western Cape Government's budget is redistributed to poor communities. #DAdelivers\" Verdict unproven Bothma referred Africa Check to a presentation compiled by Western Cape Premier Helen Zille's office on provincial ' expenditure on the poor '. However, the source provided does not support the claim. The presentation, delivered by Helen Zille in August 2012, claims that an analysis of a representative sample of departments revealed that 76% of their budgets were redistributed to poor communities. Only the departments of health, education, human settlements, social development and cultural affairs and sport were considered in the analysis. Expenditure in eight other provincial departments was not analysed. Claim \"8 of the top 10 South African municipalities in the Municipal IQ's Productivity Index are governed by @DA_News. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct This claim has been tweeted a number of times since November 2013 and is said to have been taken from Municipal IQ's 2013 Productivity Index. Municipal IQ is an independent data service that monitors and assesses South Africa municipalities. The claim is not strictly correct (though it is close) as the index shows that six of the ten top-performing local municipalities are run by the DA and one is run by a DA-Cope coalition. Claim \"In its first four years in government, the DA-governed City of Cape Town tripled the number of houses delivered per year. #DAdelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct The DA said that the claim was sourced from the Cape Town Story , a booklet published by the DA in March 2011. It claimed that \"the post-2006 City government has built three times the number of houses its predecessor managed\". Frouwien Bosman, a DA policy researcher, told Africa Check that the claim was based on comparing the average number of houses delivered under the ANC to the number delivered under the DA in 2008/09 and 2009/10. In 2003/04 , 2004/05 and 2005/06 , the last three years the ANC ran the City of Cape Town, an average of 3,287 housing opportunities were provided, according to the city's annual reports. Under the DA , 9,576 housing opportunities were delivered in the city in 2008/09 and 8,950 housing opportunities were delivered in 2009/10. In 2010/11 and 2011/12 , the number of housing opportunities delivered dropped to 7,472 and 7,141 respectively. Claim \"The W Cape Govt spends R33.6mil on its Premier's Advancement of Youth Project & its youth wage subsidy programme every year. #DADelivers\" Verdict mostly-correct Bothma told Africa Check that the \"youth wage subsidy programme\" that the tweet refers to is the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism's \"Work and Skills Programme\". Bronwynne Jooste, a spokesperson for the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, told Africa Check that R10-million was spent each year on the programme in 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. Expenditure decreased to R8.9-million in 2012/13 and R13.4-million was spent on the programme in 2013/14. Jooste couldn't provide a document or an audit to support the figures. She said that the Work and Skills Programme's expenditure was not accounted for separately in the department's financial statements and was included under the broader category of \"workforce development\". The Premier's Advancement of Youth Project started in 2012/13. Zak Mbhele, Zille's spokesman in her capacity as Premier,  told Africa Check that R23,1-million is spent every year on the Premier's Advancement of Youth Project. This, he said, was based on paying 750 interns R2,400 per month for 12 months. An annual amount of R1,5-million is also allocated for administrative costs. But Mbhele was unable to provide documentation to support the figure.  \"\u2026[T]he remuneration expenditure on the [Premier's Advancement of Youth Project] is part and parcel of personnel costs across all departments and is not reflected in a separate, collated document,\" he explained via email. If the figures provided by Jooste and Mbhele are correct, it would appear that a combined total of R32-million was spent in 2012/13 financial year and  a further R36.5 million in 2013/14. These figures are close to, but not in line with, the R33.6-million per year that the DA's claim refers to. It is unclear how the DA calculated that figure.

For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100.When Kenyatta came to power in 2013 there were 75,325 police officers in Kenya, according to the national police service.

The population was 45.4 million, for a ratio of 1:502.In 2017, Africa Check found that the president had incorrectly claimed that there was one police officer for every 390 people. The ratio was between 1:448 and 1:489.And in 2018, there were 105,867 officers serving a population of 46.4 million, for a ratio of 1:439.The most recent economic survey put the number of police officers at 100,481 in 2020. The estimated population was 48.7 million, for a police-to-population ratio of 1:485. The survey, published in September 2021, gave its source as the police service.

        "doc": "Deaths among children and young people due to MIS are rare and arise from complications caused by COVID-19 and other illnesses, not vaccines. An article on the fake news site \"Humans Are Free\" states that thousands of young children are becoming seriously ill, or are dying, from Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) brought on by COVID-19 vaccines. It states that 17 children died in a hospital in Jaipur and that 2000 others across India are suffering from \"an excess of antibodies\" due to MIS. There are no reliable reports of the incidents mentioned. The Hindustan Times reports that 17 children died in the JK Lone hospital in Rajhastan due to MIS. Crucially, however, the article explains that MIS was due to complications caused by COVID-19 itself, not the vaccine. According to the Hindustan Times piece, MIS causes inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction and typically occurs two weeks after a child has recovered from COVID-19. Early symptoms include chest pain, abdominal pain, and vomiting, and can lead to respiratory problems. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) noted that in a review of 26 countries there was a 0.14 percent chance of MIS among children who were unwell with COVID-19, although it notes this figure may be slightly higher due to inaccurate data on cases among children. The Humans Are Free piece also links to an article on GreatGameIndia, which reports on the death of a 13-year-old boy resulting from heart problems after he'd received a second Pfizer shot. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was investigating the death and other instances of myocarditis following the vaccine. On its website, the CDC stressed that these instances were extremely rare and that \"CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older, given the risk of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death. \" GreatGameIndia provides a link to a tweet on the article, but the page no longer exists. The boy's aunt, Tami Burages, deleted a Twitter thread on the incident, as she claimed that while she believes her nephew's death should be investigated, Fox News and other far right networks had \"politicized\" the tragedy as a means of undermining public trust in the vaccine, and clarified that she is \"pro-vaccine.\" As such, we can confirm that the incident described on Humans Are Free is false, as children are far more likely to become fatally ill due to complications caused by COVID-19 than vaccines. While there have been isolated reports of deaths among young people after the vaccine, these instances are rare and their circumstances are still being investigated by authorities.

        "claim": "\"During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans, but because of the way districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did.\"",
        "doc": "The Democratic member of Congress from Austin, otherwise represented in Washington, D.C. by Republicans, says Democrats nationally got more votes in 2012 yet Republicans ended up with their House majority. \"During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans,\" Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a Nov. 4, 2013, talk at the University of Texas at San Antonio. \"But because of the way\" House \"districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did.\" The first part of his claim sounded familiar, but is it right that this outcome arose from the way House districts were designed? In every state, districts must be redrawn every 10 years to adjust for population changes as measured by the decennial U.S. census. Each state has its own method for drawing districts. And Texas, like most states, entrusts most of the line-drawing to state legislators. Over the past dozen years or so, Doggett pointed out in his talk, he has represented a variety of communities--at one time holding a district that stretched from the Texas-Mexico border north into Austin--largely due to how districts were drawn by the state\u2019s dominant Republicans. Nationally, he said, the redistricting process \"has had a significant impact on more than me and indeed on the whole framing of the national debate that is going on right now.\" His lecture later touched on the influence of money in politics. Doggett, who currently represents a district snaking south from Travis County into its base in San Antonio, told the university audience that Republican domination of redistricting in statehouses effectively helped the GOP maintain its House majority. To our inquiry, Doggett said by email: \"I spoke about a number of factors that explain the composition and conduct of the current Congress. Redistricting looms large among them as a very significant factor. Gerrymandering,\" district-drawing to partisan advantage, \"has only reinforced obstructionists.\" Doggett\u2019s spokeswoman, Kelsey Crow, sent an email pointing out an Oct. 14, 2013, NBC News report stating: \"When Republicans won the majority of statehouses in 2010, it ensured they would be redrawing the maps in those states. And lo and behold, it paid off in 2012. Nationwide, Democrats running for Congress got 1.1 million more votes, but Republicans sent 33 more members to the House.\" It\u2019s helpful to remember that the Republican margin of 33 seats means Democrats fell 17 victories short of capturing the House majority. Doggett\u2019s raw numbers were accurate. Democrats outpolled Republicans in the 2012 House races, but Republicans ended up with a 33-seat House majority. A December 2012 analysis by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan D.C. publication, said House Democrats out-drew their Republican counterparts by more than 1 million votes--1.37 million votes to be precise, Cook\u2019s House editor, David Wasserman, later calculated. Between the two parties, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the vote while winning 46 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. The Republican advantage was a decrease from the party\u2019s 49-seat majority in 2011-12; Democrats held House majorities from 2007 through 2010. But political scientists quibble over whether how districts were redrawn entirely explains the GOP majority. (This is a good time to take a gulp of water/beverage of your preference). Writing in December 2012, Wasserman pointed to two \"unprecedented\" factors that explained the GOP\u2019s House grip: the thick concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and the GOP\u2019s wide control of drawing congressional districts. Other analyses similarly support redistricting as a reason, but some political scientists suggest other factors were more significant such as the advantages enjoyed by Republicans seeking re-election as incumbents. Even before the 2012 elections, Republican influence over redistricting looked likely to be significant. A George Mason University political scientist, Michael McDonald, who later worked as an expert in a Texas Democratic Party challenge to how Republicans drew districts in Texas, noted in a April 2011 article published by the American Political Science Association that thanks to election results in 2010 and earlier, Republicans would dominate redistricting in more states than Democrats. Among the 43 states with more than one congressional district, he wrote, six would rely on bipartisan commissions to draw new districts, 16 would have Republicans in control, six would have Democrats in charge and 15 would act as a divided government. But different sometimes complex methods of analyzing the 2012 results generate different conclusions about the effects of the line-drawing, though all point to Republicans benefiting most: --On Nov. 8, 2012, Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog compared how well Democratic President Barack Obama fared in 2012 in most of the states where Republicans controlled redistricting leading up to the election year compared with how Democrats running for House seats came out. In Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Pennsylvania, Matthews wrote, Democrats won clutches of seats as Obama prevailed statewide: \"In Virginia, for instance, 27 percent of seats went to Democrats, while Obama got 52 percent of the vote. In Pennsylvania, 28 percent of seats went to Democrats, and Obama won 53 percent.\" There was balance in two states, Matthews wrote: \"Utah gave a quarter of its vote to Obama and a quarter of its House seats to Democrats and New Hampshire sent two Democrats to the House despite Obama's only having a six-point margin there.\" --Just before the 2012 elections, an Oct. 25, 2012, preliminary study by the Brennan Center for Justice, part of the New York University School of Law, concluded that the way districts were drawn would give Republican hopefuls six seats more than they would have won if the election was carried out under the previous district lines. After the elections, a center analyst, Sundeep Iyer, wrote that the prediction mostly held up because five seats flipped from a Democrat to a Republican due to redistricting, he wrote, while six Republican-held seats were saved by redistricting. \"In states where Republicans controlled redistricting,\" Iyer said, \"Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats.\" Then again, Iyer wrote, \"even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats.\" Still, Iyer said, where Democrats held redistricting sway, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, while Republicans lost five additional seats. --Another proponent of the \"redistricting matters\" school, Princeton University neuroscientist and election forecaster Sam Wang, described how partisans can make the line-drawing work to their partisan advantage in a Feb. 2, 2013, opinion column in the New York Times. \"Gerrymandering is not hard,\" Wang wrote. \"The core technique is to jam voters likely to favor your opponents into a few throwaway districts where the other side will win lopsided victories, a strategy known as \u2018packing.\u2019 Arrange other boundaries to win close victories, \u2018cracking\u2019 opposition groups into many districts.\" By his own methodology, Wang estimated that redistricting cost Democrats 15 House seats in the 2012 elections. --Earlier, Washington University post-doctoral student Nicholas Goedert, said in a Nov. 15, 2012, post on the Monkey Cage blog, founded in 2007 to publicize research by political scientists, that redistricting most likely cost Democrats seven races nationally. Likewise, political scientists John Sides and Eric McGhee said redistricting cost Democrats seven seats, writing that they reached their figure by looking at what would have happened if the election took place in the pre-2012 House districts. \"This\" seven \"is not nothing, but it\u2019s far less than what the Democrats needed to take back the House,\" the two wrote in a Feb. 17, 2013, commentary on the Wonkblog. Sides and McGhee concluded that once they considered the effect of incumbency on the 2012 results, the seeming pro-Republican impact of gerrymandering vanished. \"That is, the ability of Republicans to retain the House majority may have been due to incumbency advantage, not new and more favorable districts,\" they wrote. Conversely, they wrote, removing the percentage point gains attributable to incumbency generated results indicating that Democrats would have won 219 seats, \"virtually eliminating\" any GOP advantage traced to redistricting. By telephone, McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, said Republicans nationally pulled off \"spectacular gerrymanders\" before the 2012 elections. \"But there\u2019s no clear evidence that there\u2019s been this systematic ability of Republicans to draw better districts going way back on a national scale,\" McGhee said. With help from Keesha Gaskins of the Brennan Center, we queried others who have weighed in on redistricting and the 2012 results, among them University of Chicago law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, who said by email that he thinks Doggett got it right, but reaching that conclusion depends on whether one interprets his statement as speaking to redistricting over more than the past couple years. \"It's clear that the party preferred by a minority of voters won a majority of seats in 2012,\" Stephanapoulos said. \"Whether this is because of redistricting depends entirely on what your benchmark is. If your benchmark is proportional representation for each party, then it's clear that redistricting (together with single-member districts) is to blame. If your benchmark is the districts that were in place before the latest round of redistricting, then redistricting may only have won the Republicans 11 seats\u2026.But the districts in place before 2012 themselves were drawn by legislatures, and most observers thought the pre-2012 districts already favored Republicans in several states.\" Next, we ran the range of these analyses past Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff, who has advised legislative leaders about redistricting issues since the 1970s. Bickerstaff said by phone that the Republicans\u2019 majority isn\u2019t due solely to how districts were designed. \"It\u2019s more complicated,\" Bickerstaff said. Our ruling Doggett said Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans in 2012 but because of the way districts are designed, Republicans got 33 more House seats. Democratic House nominees drew nearly 1.4 million more votes than Republicans and the GOP landed a 33-seat House majority. Redistricting was a major factor in that result, but experts also diverge over whether how districts were designed was the key driver. Incumbency and the concentration of Democrats in congested cities also have been aired as significant. We rate Doggett\u2019s statement, which lacks this clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",

        "doc": "Update (28 November 2022): Another video is being shared on social media, which is a commercial for a hair growth serum. According to the video, the serum contains ginger extract, which stimulates the hair follicles and encourages hair growth. Let\u2019s fact-check this claim through this article. Claim: \u2018King of Ginger\u2019- a hair serum containing ginger extract stimulates the hair follicles and encourages hair growth. Fact: Although ginger is used in East Asian medicine to treat hair fall, There is no scientific evidence that ginger helps the growth of hair. On the contrary, a study suggested that it can suppress human hair growth. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. Searching on the internet with relevant keywords to find the claim\u2019s veracity led us to a scientific research article. This study was performed by researchers on the effect of 6-gingerol, the main component of ginger, on human hair growth. It was found that 6-gingerol does not promote hair growth, but on the contrary, it can suppress human hair growth. Regarding the side effects of using ginger as a remedy for hair loss, Healthline states, \u2018Despite the fact that ginger is a natural substance, it can present side effects in some people. It\u2019s always a good idea to check with a doctor beforehand, especially if you take medications or have any pre-existing conditions.\u2019 You can find their full article titled \u2018Can Using Ginger on Your Hair or Scalp Improve Its Health?\u2019 here. To sum up, there is no conclusive evidence to prove that Ginger promotes hair growth. Published (17 May 2022): A social media post claiming that the use of ginger oil on belly button would reduce fat and helps in weight loss is being widely shared. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Applying ginger oil on belly button would burn fat ten times faster and eventually help in weight loss. Fact: Experts have clarified that there is no scientific evidence to say that ginger oil would help in weight loss. There are reports and research papers which state ginger water helps in weight loss. Gingerol, a bioactive compound in ginger has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which help in weight loss. However, there are no reports or research studies to say applying ginger oil on naval would reduce belly fat or helps in weight loss. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. According to reports, gingerol, a bioactive compound in ginger has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which help in weight loss. \u2018Ginger aids in colon cleansing, helping you to get rid of harmful toxins while promoting healthy digestion. By increasing digestive efficiency with diet, you can shed extra fat and boost metabolism, and thus make weight loss much easier and effective\u2019 reported the article. However, in order to avail the weight loss benefits of ginger, these reports suggest intake of ginger water rather than applying ginger oil as claimed in the post. Further, preliminary research on rats revealed that ginger water would reduce body weight gain and improve energy expenditure. Ginger possesses various therapeutic properties, such as antioxidant effects and anti-inflammatory impacts. As far as applying ginger oil is concerned, experts have clarified that application of ginger oil on naval is unlikely to show any impact. Earlier speaking to experts, AFP debunked a similar claim saying there is no scientific evidence to prove ginger oil would help in weight loss. \u2018Donna Ryan, a researcher on obesity and professor emerita at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, said there is \u201cnothing in the scientific literature\u201d to support the claim that it can eliminate cellulite, or subcutaneous fat that creates dimples under the skin\u2019, reported AFP. While there are reports of ginger water helping in weight loss, we could not find any reports regarding application of ginger oil on belly button helping weight loss. To sum it up, there is no scientific evidence to state that applying ginger oil on belly button can help weight loss.",

        "claim": "Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson \"opposes faster broadband internet in small towns\" and \"got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests.\"",
        "doc": "In June 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson aired a TV ad emphasizing his humble beginnings as a dishwasher and machine operator. The next day, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin released a radio ad arguing just the opposite. The ad painted the Republican Johnson as a \"multi-millionaire CEO turned Senator\" out of touch with the needs of Wisconsinites living in rural areas. \"Living in the country doesn\u2019t mean we should have fewer opportunities,\" the speaker says. \"Unfortunately, that\u2019s what Wisconsin gets with Sen. Ron Johnson.\" Later the speaker says: \"He opposes faster broadband internet in small towns. Maybe because he got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests.\" Former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, running against Johnson, has argued for rural broadband to be more like a public utility. Johnson opposes that idea. But that doesn\u2019t mean he opposes bringing faster broadband to rural areas. Let\u2019s examine the two parts of the claim one at a time. Faster internet in rural small towns Many Wisconsinites in rural areas lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. While the Federal Communications Commission has said maximizing access to broadband internet is a priority, there is widespread disagreement about how to pay for the infrastructure upgrades needed to make it a reality. Harry Hartfield, communications director for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Johnson\u2019s voting record demonstrates he opposes to faster broadband in rural areas. He pointed to two votes in particular: In 2012, Johnson voted for a Senate bill amendment that would have eliminated the authority of the Agriculture Department to increase the amount of federal grants to provide broadband access in rural areas. In 2013, Johnson voted against a Senate bill amendment that established a pilot program to expand high speed broadband service to rural areas. \"If (Johnson) supported faster internet in rural communities, he would have supported legislation that did just that,\" Hartfield said. Hartfield also noted Johnson and five other Republican senators argued the definition of broadband was \"too fast\" in a 2016 letter to the FCC chairman, since few applications require download speeds of 25 Mbps, the new standard. They gave the example of Netflix, which recommends download speeds of 5 Mbps to stream high-definition video. The letter\u2019s authors said they worried increased regulation as a result of the standard would disincentivize telecommunications companies to offer higher speeds. Barry Orton, a professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that most households have more than one person using the internet at once, which makes faster speeds necessary. \"Why are they writing a letter saying don\u2019t expand the broadband definition?\" said Orton, who helped Feingold\u2019s campaign develop its broadband materials. \"Because expansion of the broadband definition doesn\u2019t help existing providers that are offering less than that.\" For its part, Johnson\u2019s campaign says he supports increased broadband connectivity \u2014 but wants the private sector deliver the services. \"Ron has worked on a bipartisan basis to create an environment where more broadband companies can invest and innovate to provide better internet access and more choice across Wisconsin,\" Johnson\u2019s campaign said in an April statement. Campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger provided two additional letters to support this stance. A 2013 letter signed by Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, urged the FCC to finalize its plan to distribute funds for deployment of broadband to rural areas. A 2014 letter signed by more than 40 senators asked the FCC to carefully update rules governing broadband in rural areas to encourage competition. So, while the party cited two votes, it did not give a full picture of Johnson\u2019s record on the matter. Indeed, there may be multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Contributions from telecom special interests The ad also claims Johnson\u2019s campaign got \"nearly $90,000\" in contributions from telecommunications special interests. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin cited OpenSecrets.org, a website that pulls from Federal Election Committee data, which shows Johnson received at least $95,000 in contributions since 2010 from political action committees representing \"telecom services\" companies, including AT&T, Charter and Comcast. Our rating The Democratic Party\u2019s radio ad said Johnson \"opposes faster broadband internet in small towns\" and he \"got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests.\" Johnson\u2019s voting record shows he opposed two particular proposals to grow faster broadband in rural areas and one signed letter to the FCC showed he was against a faster definition of broadband. But two other letters to the FCC suggest he\u2019s in favor of faster rural broadband \u2014 but concerned with its execution. Johnson\u2019s campaign has said he supports using the private sector to grow rural broadband. The second part of the claim is on point \u2014 Johnson actually received somewhat more from the industry than the ad claimed. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",

The widget in turn leads to a website which states that users will receive a phone call from an \"account manager\" and asks them to \"keep your preferred deposit method ready\".

Jai Shri Ram Jai Shri Ram Jai Shri Ram!!\" By Dheeshma Puzhakkal: Did Mark Zuckerberg say \"Jai Shri Ram\" is written on Facebook more than 200 crore times each day? This is what is being claimed by social media users as they share a picture collage of Zuckerberg and Lord Ram. One such claim posted on Facebook reads, \"Mark Zuckerberg claims that each and every day at least 200 CRORES \"Jai Shri Ram\" are written on Facebook. Let's add a few more thousands here please. Jai Shri Ram Jai Shri Ram Jai Shri Ram!!\" advertisement India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The Facebook CEO has not made any such comment regarding \"Jai Shri Ram\". Similar claims were made by multiple social media users earlier this month around the time of Ram temple bhoomi pujan in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the temple on August 5. The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. AFWA probe We could not find any credible source reporting that Zuckerberg made such a statement on \"Jai Shri Ram\". Also, neither Facebook's blog newsroom, which updates the social media giant's latest announcements, nor Zuckerberg's official social media accounts, made a similar remark regarding the popularity of \"Jai Shri Ram\" on Facebook. We also checked the virality of \"Jai Shri Ram\" on Facebook over the past 12 months using social media monitoring platform 'CrowdTangle'. According to 'CrowdTangle', this phrase was most popular on Facebook in the first week of August around bhoomi pujan. A sharp decline in mentions was witnessed before and after the first week of August. According to 'CrowdTangle', \"Jai Shri Ram\" found 18,763 mentions in English in the past 30 days, and 55,186 mentions in the past 12 months. Hindi numbers were more impressive, with 5,77,604 mentions in the past 30 days days, and 17,21,155 mentions in the past 12 months. Google Trends also showed a similar variation before and after the first week of August. However, it is clear that Zuckerberg never said \"Jai Shri Ram\" is being written more than 200 crore times every day on Facebook. Also, in 2020, this phrase was popular only in the first week of August, but the numbers were far less than what is being claimed. --- ENDS --- Edited By: Nayanika Sengupta Published On: Aug 28, 2020",

        "doc": "Under pressure of a lawsuit, the Obama administration recently released memos on the interrogation of terror suspects during the Bush administration. The memos detailed techniques that included waterboarding, a simulated drowning maneuver widely considered to be torture. Some torture opponents have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials. Republicans, meanwhile, are firing back at Democrats in Congress, saying that they implicitly condoned the actions. Democrats \"had control since January of 2007,\" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a television interview. \"They haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law.\" There is a grain of truth in his claim, but he conveniently ignores the actions of the Democratic Congress. Democratsdidpass legislation in 2008 that would have had the effect of outlawing waterboarding by restricting U.S. agents to interrogation methods outlined in the Army Field Manual. The manual specifically forbids waterboarding. But President George W. Bush vetoed the bill and Democrats were not able to muster the two-thirds majority necessary to override the veto. This was a big issue during the 2008 presidential campaign, because Sen. John McCain opposed the bill, even though he had said waterboarding is torture. At the time, McCain said he wasn't comfortable restricting intelligence personnel to the Army Field Manual. It's worth noting that some elected officials do not believe that Congress needed to pass a law saying that waterboarding was illegal. McCain, for example, said in 2007 that waterboarding already was illegal. \"It's in violation of the Geneva Conventions. It's in violation of existing law,\" he said at a debate in St. Petersburg. After the Bush administration memos were released, McCain said the legal reasoning behind them was \"deeply flawed,\" though he did not call for prosecutions. So Democratsdidtry to change laws to end waterboarding after gaining control of Congress and initially passed the law. But they were stopped by a presidential veto. So Gingrich's statement that they \"haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law,\" is only true because of the veto. The Democrats certainly tried to pass a law that would have had the effect of outlawing waterboarding. We rate his statement Barely True.",

        "doc": "With all eyes on Iowa for the Republican caucuses, President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign reminded watchers of his own Iowa win \u2014 and what he has done to keep his campaign promises.Obama for America bought banner ads across the home page of the online Des Moines Register on Jan. 3, 2012, with a link to Obama's 2008 victory speech in the state.Music plays as candidate Obama promises action on health care, taxes, energy independence and the war in Iraq. Between clips, white text across the screen highlights Obama's policy accomplishments.For example, candidate Obama declares, \"I\u2019ll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas.\" At that point, an on-screen visual reads: \"Closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas.\"We wondered whether the ad\u2019s claim about Obama\u2019s accomplishment is justified.We asked the Obama campaign for supporting material, and they said they were referring to Public Law 111-226, a measure that was primarily aimed at providing economic aid to states. To offset the cost of new spending, however, the bill included a few provisions related to taxation of international corporations -- what a number of tax experts have told us can be fairly described as loopholes.As we explained in a previous item, Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2010. The tax provisions took away more than a half dozen existing exemptions and credits estimated to be worth $9.8 billion over the subsequent 10 years.Here\u2019s how it worked. The United States, unlike a variety of other countries, taxes its companies on the foreign profits they earn. But the companies don't have to pay taxes on their foreign earnings until they bring those profits back to the U.S. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as they can.But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments, and some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid on the same income to foreign governments. That's what the law tried to address. It said that companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until they report their income.But while there is some truth to the claim that the president signed legislation that \"closed corporate tax loopholes thta were sending profits overseas,\" we should point out a few issues.First, under the old law, companies weren\u2019t necessarily \"sending profits overseas,\" as the ad states, but may have been keeping in place profits that were already being generated overseas. Still, this strikes us as a fairly minor linguistic quibble.A more pertinent question is whether the legislation Obama signed fulfills the pledge he made in Iowa in 2008 -- that he\u2019ll \"be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas.\"H. David Rosenbloom, director of the International Tax Program at the New York University School of Law, calls the legislation \"very narrow.\"\"It addresses a specific tax planning strategy whereby foreign taxes and credits are \u2018split\u2019 from the foreign income that gave rise to them,\" he said. Left relatively unscathed is the broader \"deferral regime\" that allows companies to avoid U.S. taxes on foreign income as long as they do not \"repatriate\" -- bring home -- the money and avoid a few other hurdles.For instance, one proposal by former Walt Disney Co. executive Preston Padden, now an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado, urges a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, which would be aligned with most foreign countries, paired with stricter \"anti-deferral\" rules.\"A tax rate comparable to foreign countries would greatly eliminate the incentives to move operations and jobs offshore because of rate differentials, and the anti-deferral regime would minimize the benefits to U.S. companies from offshoring operations and jobs,\" Padden wrote in a recent op-ed.The narrower law signed by Obama, by contrast, \"will hardly prevent companies from sending profits abroad, keeping them abroad, and otherwise profiting from the current set of international tax rules,\" Rosenbloom said.Even after passage of the 2010 law, \"most experts would agree that the U.S. international tax system encourages U.S. multinationals to accumulate profits offshore,\" said Lawrence Lokken, an emeritus professor of law at the University of Florida.Our rulingWhile there is some truth to the claim that Obama signed legislation that \"closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas,\" experts say the law by itself doesn\u2019t live up to Obama\u2019s promise in Iowa to \"be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas.\" Incentives deeply embedded in the tax code still exist.

        "claim": "The Biden administration \u201chalted deportations for all illegal aliens \u2014 murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported.\"",
        "doc": "Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., criticized Democrats\u2019 immigration proposals and claimed that President Joe Biden was giving terrorists and other criminals a pass to stay in the country even if they were here illegally. \"They have halted deportations for all illegal aliens \u2014 murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported,\" Cotton told CPAC attendees Feb. 26 in Orlando. Is Cotton right about criminals being allowed to stay? No. His claim ignores the policies of the Department of Homeland Security. \"Sen. Cotton misspoke,\" with respect to terrorists not being deported, James Arnold, a spokesperson for Cotton, told PolitiFact. On Jan. 20, David Pekoske, then-acting secretary of homeland security, ordered a review of immigration enforcement practices and an immediate 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal. \"Due to limited resources, DHS cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons unlawfully in the United States,\" Pekoske said. \"Rather, DHS must implement civil immigration enforcement based on sensible priorities and changing circumstances.\" The deportation pause did not apply to people who had engaged or were suspected of engaging in terrorism or espionage, or posed a danger to national security and public safety. People were still eligible for deportation if they were in prison or jail and released on or after the date of Pekoske\u2019s memo, and if they were convicted of an aggravated felony. An aggravated felony includes murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor. Cotton also left out that a federal judge in Texas has since blocked the deportation moratorium indefinitely. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration over the deportation pause. DHS told PolitiFact that Cotton\u2019s claim was incorrect, noting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Feb. 18 issued interim operating guidance that said removal resources would focus on threats to national security, border security and public safety. \"Individuals are presumed to be a threat to public safety if, for example, they have been convicted of an aggravated felony or engaged in certain activity as part of a criminal gang or transnational criminal organization and there is reason to believe they currently pose a threat,\" ICE said. We don\u2019t have data on how many murderers, rapists, gang members or terrorists have been deported during the Biden administration. But it is inaccurate to say that their deportations were halted. Cotton said, \"They have halted deportations for all illegal aliens, murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported.\" Biden\u2019s administration ordered a 100-day deportation pause, but it did not apply to criminals such as murderers, rapists, terrorists or gang members. We rate Cotton\u2019s claim False. UPDATE, Feb. 26, 7:10 p.m.: We updated the story shortly after publication to clarify the response from Cotton's spokesman. It did not affect the rating.",

        "claim": "The number of pregnant women who have miscarried increased by \u201c366% in just six weeks\u201d as a result of their receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.",
        "doc": "An alarming article that warns of miscarriages following COVID-19 vaccinations is being widely shared on social media. The story, published by a website called The Daily Expose, claims to have calculated a significant increase in the number of recent miscarriages in the United Kingdom as a direct result of pregnant women getting the shot. The article\u2019s headline, which is circulating as an image in social media posts in the U.S., reads: \"Number of women to lose their unborn child after having the COVID vaccine increases by 366% in just six weeks.\" The article says that the miscarriages came \"as a result of the mothers receiving one of the COVID-19 vaccines.\" This is misleading and inaccurate. First, the image does not indicate that the figures the article cites come from the U.K., not the U.S., even though the widely circulated version of the post we found included the Instagram handle @antimaskNYC, an account that also shared the post. Second, U.K. health officials said the article takes the numbers out of context, as it doesn\u2019t account for the increase in vaccination rates over time, or the average number of miscarriages that occur naturally. Lastly, there is no evidence of a causal link between miscarriages and COVID-19 vaccines. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story references data from the U.K.\u2019s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\u2019s Yellow Card scheme. The reporting system releases weekly reports and monitors possible side effects of vaccines, similar to the VAERS system maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Just six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is appalling,\" the article says. It claims that between Dec. 9, 2020, and Jan. 24, 2021, a total of six women had a miscarriage \"as a direct result\" of receiving one of the COVID-19 vaccines. The story then says there were 22 more reports of miscarriages from Jan. 24 through March 7, bringing the total to 28 \u2014 a rise of about 366.6%. But the article fails to consider how many people were vaccinated during these time periods, and it overlooks the average number of naturally occurring miscarriages in the U.K. What\u2019s more, no causal link between the two has been established: reports that these incidents occurred after vaccination are not confirmation that they resulted from a vaccine. When asked about the claim, the U.K. regulator, known as MHRA, told PolitiFact that there is \"no pattern\" to suggest an elevated risk of miscarriage related to the COVID-19 vaccines. \"The number of Yellow Card reports for any suspected reaction should not be compared from one period to another or between vaccines, as this takes no account of any differences in the extent or patterns of usage between the time periods,\" the agency said. In the Dec. 9 to Jan. 24 time period when six miscarriages were reported to Yellow Card, there were roughly 7.1 million people who had been vaccinated. By March 7, the number vaccinated jumped to 22.7 million. That means that, in the later period when 22 miscarriages were reported, 15.6 million more people had been vaccinated. Based on those raw numbers, the rates of people reporting miscarriages in both periods are closer \u2014 0.000084% in the early group compared with 0.000141% in the later group, which included more than three times as many women of child-bearing age. MHRA noted that the number of people ages 18 to 45 who received a first dose increased from 1.3 million to 4.3 million in the same time frame \u2014 and with half of these expected to be women \u2014 the number of women of child-bearing age who were vaccinated is estimated to have increased 223% from 665,524 to 2,146,866. \"Sadly, miscarriage is estimated to occur in about 1 in 4 pregnancies (equal to 25 in 100) in the U.K. (outside of the pandemic), and most occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, so some miscarriages would be expected to occur following vaccination purely by chance,\" the agency wrote. \"The MHRA has received a small number of reports of miscarriage following vaccine exposure in first 12 weeks of pregnancy, which we are closely monitoring. There is currently no pattern to suggest an elevated risk of miscarriage related to exposure to the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy.\" According to the Mayo Clinic, miscarriage \"is a relatively common experience\" and occurs in about 10% to 20% of known pregnancies, with the rate increasing with age. Many reproductive health experts say the true number is likely much higher. The Daily Expose article also claimed that one stillbirth occurred following an AstraZeneca vaccination, which the MHRA disputed. The agency said some reports of events related to pregnancy later turn out to be incorrect and that \"no actual stillbirths\" have been reported so far. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the CDC have reached similar conclusions, saying that there is no evidence to date that the shots cause any problems in pregnancy. But they caution that data is still limited. The agencies are using safety monitoring systems like VAERS to collect more information and hope to have more robust results in the coming months. The U.K. government, however, does not routinely recommend the COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women. Officials there acknowledge that available data hasn\u2019t raised any safety concerns, but they say it\u2019s still too limited to recommend the shots to all pregnant women. The MHRA added that the potential benefits of vaccination may be important for those who are at high risk of getting infected, or those with clinical conditions that put them at high risk of suffering serious complications from COVID-19. The CDC, as well as many reproductive health organizations, says the vaccines should be offered to eligible pregnant and breastfeeding women, and recommend that they (and those who plan to become pregnant) talk to their doctors to weigh the risks and benefits. A claim circulating online claims that the number of pregnant women who have miscarried increased by \"366% in just six weeks\" as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. This statement takes data out of context and presents an unfounded conclusion. Health officials in the U.K. say that there is currently no evidence of an increase in miscarriages after COVID-19 immunization. The article on which the claim is based misrepresents figures from the country\u2019s vaccine reporting system, and officials say it doesn\u2019t account for the increased vaccination rate over time, or the country\u2019s average rate of miscarriages. Nor is there any evidence that has shown a causal link between the vaccine and miscarriages. We rate this False.",

        "doc": "Hundreds of people have shared hoax appeals searching for a missing man with dementia named 'George' across the UK. Full Fact has seen examples searching for 'George Smith' shared in Yeovil and Nailsea in Somerset, Long Eaton in Derbyshire and Inverclyde , Scotland. The same images and text have also been used in hoax posts claiming to search for 'George Wayne' in Winchester (Hampshire), High Wycombe (Buckinghamshire) and again in both Long Eaton and Inverclyde . Together, these posts have been shared more than 1,800 times. The posts all use near-identical text, which says: \"FLOOD YOUR FEEDS ~ MISSING!! in[location]. \"Our Dad, George Smith aged 74 drove out last night in his Toyota Hilux truck and he still hasn't returned. He doesn't know where he's going, he has dementia. \"There is a silver alert activated on him. Please help bump this post so we can get him home safely.\" They also use the same collage of three images\u2014a close-up image of a man wearing a grey hat, another of the same man with a group of children and a third image of a red truck. But the man in the picture does not go by either of these names, and is not missing in the UK. The pictures appear to have been taken from a recent appeal for a 74-year-old veteran who went missing in Brook Park, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. The man was found several days after going missing from his home \"in a confused state\"  and is expected to recover . We have not been able to trace the original picture of the red truck shown in the posts, but a UK number plate search confirms the vehicle is a Toyota and has up-to-date tax and MOT registrations. The man actually pictured in the posts was instead reported to be driving a dark blue/green 2000 Buick LeSabre. We have previously fact checked many similar posts which claimed to be searching for other elderly missing people, often also identified as having dementia. As with the hoax about 'George', many of these posts also make reference to a \"silver alert\". This is an indication that the posts are likely to have originated in the US as the \"silver alert\" system \u2014designed to notify the public about missing people, usually those who are elderly with dementia or similar conditions\u2014only operates there. We have previously checked many different posts on Facebook buy, sell or trade groups which falsely raise an alarm for missing children , abandoned infants or injured dogs. These posts are often edited later to promote things like property listings, with comments frequently disabled, so that users who see what is happening are unable to call them out publicly. This may cause local community groups to become overwhelmed with false information and potentially result in genuine appeals being ignored or dismissed as fake. We have written to Facebook's parent company Meta expressing these concerns and asking the company to take stronger action in response to this problem. It's always worth checking whether content is real before you share it. We have written a guide on how to verify misleading images which you can read here . Image courtesy of Solen Feyissa",

This works out to N1.23 trillion, of a total of N17.13 trillion.It said that an international agreement in 2021 committed countries to spend at least 15% of public funds on education.The available data shows that the budgetary allocation to education in 2022 is in fact slightly lower.The 2022 appropriation act published by the Budget Office of the Federation shows that N593.47 billion was allocated to the education ministry and its agencies for recurrent expenditure, and N159.66 billion for capital projects.N112.29 billion was also earmarked for basic education and N306 billion to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund.This adds up to N1.17 trillion, or 6.83% of the total budget.However, finance minister Zainab Ahmed\u2019s public presentation of the approved 2022 budget had the total allocation to education as N1.23 trillion, which is 7.2% of the total budget \u2013 what the paper claimed.The disparity was because the budget presentation document gave a total of N815.69 billion while the figures in the appropriation act added up to N753.13 billion.

        "doc": "Did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spend $106,000 of your money to get drunk with Hollywood elitists? No, that's not true: The story making the claim was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted. The story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on November 30, 2019, titled \"Nancy Pelosi Spent $106K of Your Money to Get Drunk With Hollywood Elitists\" (archived here) which opened: Nancy Pelosi is waking up this morning with the hangover of a lifetime after throwing a bash in Hollywood -- with taxpayer money. The event was billed as a performance of the Fundamental United Chorus of Kiwanis hosted by the Tradesman's Rights United Municipal Policy. The group's spokesman, Art Tubolls, says the festivities weren't campaign-related, so there's nothing \"illegal\" going on: 'Nancy just wanted a nice night out with her friends. As Speaker of the House, she's allowed to throw a party here and there. The way we figure it, as long as she doesn't spend more than Trump spends golfing, there's nothing to worry about.' Included in the cost of the evening were 14 cases of Wild Turkey, 14 cases of Goldshlager's, 10 cases of Hennessey, and a bottle of Frangelico because Nancy 'really likes that French stuff.' Users on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail: Nancy Pelosi Spent $106K of Your Money to Get Drunk With Hollywood Elitists She didn't even bother trying to hide her corruption. The two organizations cited in the story, the \"Fundamental United Chorus of Kiwanis\" and the \"Tradesman's Rights United Municipal Policy,\" do not to exist. The listed \"spokesperson,\" Art Tubolls, is actually a \"Propagandist for America's Last Line of Defense,\" according to their Twitter bio. \"America's Last Line of Defense,\" a network of satire websites which includes Daily World Update, is run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. The site that originally published the story is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere. Every site in the network has an about page that reads (in part): About Satire Before you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire \u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r noun The use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing. Articles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.

        "claim": "The Ninth Circuit has an overturned record \"close to 80%.\"",
        "doc": "President Donald Trump, upset by a district judge\u2019s decision to temporarily block one of his immigration orders, went on Twitter to criticize the court. \"First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court! First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!

Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the \"ban\" case and now the \"sanctuary\" case is brought in ... ...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this \u2018judge shopping!\u2019 Messy system.\" ...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this \"judge shopping!\" Messy system. District judges within the 9th Circuit have halted two versions of executive orders signed by Trump seeking to temporarily halt the U.S. entry of refugees and nationals from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. On April 25, another judge within the 9th Circuit granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against a different Trump order, one aiming to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. Given Trump\u2019s record in the 9th Circuit, we wondered if his tweet was accurate \u2013 does the circuit have an overturn rate close to 80 percent? There are at least two ways to calculate that record, and by one metric the answer is yes. By another, it\u2019s far less than 1 percent. The 9th Circuit Broadly speaking, the 9th Circuit includes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and district and bankruptcy courts in 15 federal judicial districts (among them Hawaii, and districts in Washington, California). It was a district judge in Hawaii who on March 15 blocked Trump\u2019s revised travel ban. On Feb. 3, a district judge in Seattle granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on the first version of Trump's travel ban. Trump\u2019s Justice Department filed a motion appealing that district court's decision \u2013 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motion but asked for more information. On Feb. 9, in a 3-0 decision the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Seattle judge's decision. An overturned record is a reflection of cases in which the Supreme Court ruled contrary to a lower court. The 80 percent Trump tweeted about was in reference to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 record, and does not exactly apply to the district courts. The Supreme Court typically only hears 100 to 150 of the estimated 7,000 cases it\u2019s asked to review per year. At least four of the nine Supreme Court judges must agree to hear a case, which come from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there\u2019s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court\u2019s decision was wrong. We previously looked at the 9th Circuit\u2019s record when Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity falsely claimed it was the most overturned in the country. Here\u2019s what we found then, using data from SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Supreme Court statistics archive on circuit scorecards. The Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit\u2019s reversal rate is higher than average, but it\u2019s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit placed third. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. The 9th Circuit overturned rate is similar to the findings of a 2010 analysis by Roy E. Hofer, a former president of the Federal Circuit Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association. Hofer found that from 1999 to 2008, the Supreme Court reversed or vacated (ruled null or void) 80 percent of the cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit. But he pointed out that the percentage of reversed or vacated cases for each circuit would be significantly lowerif calculated in a different way. \"Reversal rates for each court of appeals would be very small, in the range of a tenth of a percent, if calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of appeals terminated by that court,\" Hofer wrote in his article published by the American Bar Association. \"Conversely, if the reversal rate is calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, the ratio increases dramatically.\" In comparing courts\u2019 \"performance,\" it makes more sense to compare reversal rate in terms of the ratio of cases reversed over cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, Hofer said. Over the 10-year period analyzed by Hofer, the 9th Circuit terminated 114,199 cases, in comparison, the 1st Circuit had 16,620, he found. It\u2019s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more \"outlier decisions,\" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits \u2014 leading to a higher reversal rate, University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt previously told us. Our ruling Trump tweeted, the 9th Circuit has an overturned record \"close to 80%.\" An overturned record can be calculated in at least two ways. By one measure, Trump\u2019s tweet is correct if examining only cases reviewed by the Supreme Court. But by factoring in cases reversed over the total number of cases ruled by the circuit court, then the percentage is significantly smaller, far less than 1 percent. We rate Trump\u2019s claim Half True.",

        "claim": "Lithium leach fields, such as the one shown in a viral photograph circulating in 2022, pose hazards to the environment and human health.",
        "doc": "The photograph in question is genuine. It is also true that there is evidence lithium leach fields can be damaging to the environment and pose potential health threats to both birds and humans. However \u2026 The toxicity levels of the substances contained in such locations are uncertain, as is the potential for the secondary contamination of human water supplies, etc. At present, the scientific literature is limited and data is not widely available, particularly in foreign countries. A photograph shared to Twitter on Aug. 6, 2022, authentically showed a lithium leach field used in the mining and extraction of the silvery-white metal, which is a core component of batteries used in both cell phones and electric vehicles. \u201cThis is what your Electric Car batteries are made of. It is so neuro-toxic that a bird landing on this stuff dies in minutes. Take a guess what it does to your nervous system? Pat yourself on the back for saving the environment,\u201d wrote Keith Dickie on Twitter. As of this writing, the photograph had been retweeted more than 22,400 times, and reposted by other profiles on Twitter and other digital platforms. This is a Lithium leach field. This is what your Electric Car batteries are made of. It is so neuro-toxic that a bird landing on this stuff dies in minutes. Take a guess what it does to your nervous system?Pat yourself on the back for saving the environment. pic.twitter.com/HRVClWXSU3 The picture itself is authentic, but we have only been able to partially verify the other claims made in the tweet. A reverse image search led us to the website of German photographer Tom Hegen, who featured the photograph as part of \u201cThe Lithium Series 1.\u201d It appears to have been taken in Chile in 2021 near the Salar de Atacama salt flats, where a lithium extraction field is situated, south of the town San Pedro de Atacama. In an email to Snopes, Hegen confirmed that he had taken the photograph, but that he had not given permission to Dickie to republish it on Twitter and could not confirm the validity of the other comments made in the tweet. Hegen\u2019s photographs were featured by Euronews.com in February 2022, which described his work as providing \u201can overview of places where we extract, refine and consume resources with his latest series exposing the \u2018Lithium Triangle.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis region rich with natural deposits can be found where the borders of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia meet. And roughly a quarter is stored in the Salar de Atacama salt flats in northern Chile,\u201d wrote the publication in its eco news section. More than half of lithium extracted is used in the production of car batteries, according to the Minerals Education Coalition. Not only do such photographs show the extent of environmental destruction related to lithium extraction, but they also highlight other potential detrimental impacts from lithium leach fields. This is particularly true given that industrial demand for lithium has significantly increased in the last two decades, in large part to support the growing demand of electric vehicles. The Lithium Triangle of the Chilean Andes region contains more than half of the world\u2019s supply of lithium, and in March 2022, a study published in the peer-reviewed journal The Royal Society Publishing highlighted the potentially negative impacts of lithium extraction, and provided evidence to suggest that \u201cefforts to slow the expansion of mining and the impacts of climate change are, therefore, urgently needed to benefit local biodiversity and the local human economy that depends on it.\u201d This is due in large part to the arid environment of the area. Though it\u2019s rich in lithium, it is one of the driest places on Earth, and to extract lithium, miners need a lot of water, reported Wired in 2018. \u201cTo extract lithium, miners start by drilling a hole in the salt flats and pumping salty, mineral-rich brine to the surface,\u201d wrote the publication. \u201cThen they leave it to evaporate for months at a time, first creating a mixture of manganese, potassium, borax and lithium salts which is then filtered and placed into another evaporation pool, and so on. After between 12 and 18 months, the mixture has been filtered enough that lithium carbonate \u2014 white gold \u2014 can be extracted.\u201d An estimated 500,000 gallons of water is used for every metric ton of lithium, which totals around 65% of the water supply. This can have an impact on local farmers, and also has the potential for toxic chemicals from the evaporation pools to leach into local water supplies. That said, it is difficult to quantify whether the potential environmental impacts caused by lithium mining practices outweigh the long-term benefits of electric vehicles, which have been shown to cut down on fossil fuel production and greenhouse gas emissions. Just how toxic the photographed lithium leach field ponds are is a difficult question to answer, so we have contacted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in hopes of clarifying. We do know that lithium can be used as a medication, but at certain exposure levels it can have negative health impacts, including nose and throat irritation when inhaled; a buildup of fluid in the lungs; and headache, muscle weakness, confusion, seizures, and coma. It may also affect the thyroid gland, kidneys, and heart function, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. In the U.S., waste can be tested for toxicity by the EPA. But as Boston University noted, lithium mining is \u201cparticularly difficult to oversee environmentally.\u201d A 2008 review of lithium toxicity found that at least in some cases, \u201clithium is not expected to bioaccumulate and its human and environmental toxicity are low.\u201d But without seeing toxicity reports of the lithium leach field featured in the photograph, we cannot definitively say just how toxic it may be, what chemicals may be present, or whether the ponds might specifically contain a \u201cneurotoxin,\u201d as the social media post claimed. Simply put: It\u2019s very likely that they are toxic to some degree and potentially harmful to humans or birds, but we just don\u2019t know to what extent. A 2021 study published in the journal The Extractive Industries and Society similarly concluded that there is a \u201cscarcity of information\u201d available, but that it is \u201cpossible to envisage\u201d potential ecological toxicity and health hazards: However, the impacts of lithium mining have been rarely addressed in the literature. Agustinada et al. (2018) followed a bibliometric analysis related to lithium mining and impacts, remarking that studies are scarce, especially from countries producing lithium, representing about 2% of total publications \u2026 [and] the lack of investigation is mainly because sites are in distant locations and data is not available. Whether it\u2019s for copper or lithium, leach pits are indeed a challenge for migratory birds, which have been known to mistakenly land on the large bodies of chemical runoff, mistaking them for lakes or rivers. In Butte, Montana, the Berkeley Pit is a former pit copper mine that today measures one mile long by a half-mile wide. Though the pit went out of commission in 1982, its tailing pond still poses a risk for migratory snow geese. In 2016, tens of thousands of birds landed in the pit and were seen dropping dead from the sky, reported BBC at the time. Today, cannons, sirens, and drones are employed to deter birds from mistakenly landing on the toxic lake, reported Montana Public Radio. But such deterrents are a luxury not available to tailing ponds in some areas of the world, particularly in countries that do not have extensive environmental protections in place. Some argue that in addition to extracting precious minerals for battery production, there should also be a renewed focus on recycling programs, concluded a report by the environmental group Earthworks.

        "claim": "\"My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.\"",
        "doc": "Attacking a political rival when one of their donors runs into trouble is a campaign tactic that\u2019s as old as dirt.Republican Rep. Jim Renacci tossed plenty of that dirt two years ago when the incumbent Democrat he defeated, former Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance, hung onto campaign cash he got from veteran New York Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel after the House Ethics Committee chided Rangel for taking a Congressional Black Caucus trip that was improperly funded by corporations.\"As if John Boccieri\u2019s voting record isn\u2019t troubling enough, the fact that his campaign coffers have been fueled by the fruits of Washington\u2019s culture of corruption raises further questions about his judgement and his ethics,\" said a March 1, 2010 statement from Renacci\u2019s campaign.Similar attacks have been leveled at Renacci since a May 18 article in The New Republic revealed that federal law enforcement authorities were examining donations that Renacci\u2019s campaign got from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries.Federal agents sought contribution records from the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after the Toledo Blade published a report about large donations Suarez employees made to the two campaigns.Wealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt limits on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal. The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns. Mandel subsequently returned the money. But Renacci held on to the cash, pending the investigation\u2019s outcome, and that has prompted the same sort of attacks as this year\u2019s election looms that Renacci directed at Boccieri two years ago.\"Since news broke that over $100,000 in questionable donations to Congressman Jim Renacci\u2019s re-election campaign are the focus of a federal investigation, Jim Renacci has yet to do the right thing and return or donate them,\" says a notice on the campaign website of Renacci\u2019s Democratic election rival, Rep. Betty Sutton of Coply Township, near Akron..Renacci was queried about the controversy at a June 14 town hall meeting in Rocky River. He responded with an attack against Sutton: \"My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.\"Sutton, he said, \"kept them for two years until there was a final decision made, and then she returned them.\"PolitiFact Ohio wasn\u2019t aware that the federal government had investigated political contributions that Sutton received, so we asked Renacci\u2019s campaign to explain his assertion.Campaign spokesman James Slepian said the congressman misspoke, and that he instead meant to reference a past investigation into Rangel, her campaign donor. Slepian said Renacci accidentally referred to Sutton\u2019s campaign \"contributions\" rather than using the word \"donor.\"\"When he said \u2018contributions\u2019 under investigation in reference to Sutton, what he clearly meant to say was \u2018donor\u2019 under federal investigation,\" said an email from Slepian. \"As you know, Jim has issued numerous statements to the press (including The Plain Dealer) that one of Sutton\u2019s donors was under investigation for two years and that he is following the same course she took by waiting for the outcome of the investigation before deciding whether or not to return the donations. That is what he was trying to communicate.\"Slepian also blasted Sutton and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House of Representatives\u2019 Democrats, for stating that Renacci himself is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The DCCC made that claim in a June 1 press release. PolitiFact Ohio rated that it False after the head of the FBI\u2019s Canton office debunked the accusation.Sutton was among dozens of Democratic office holders to whom Rangel donated money. It is true that allegations about Rangel began to surface in 2008, when The New York Times ran a series of articles about Rangel that suggested irregularities.Allegations in those articles included abuse of rent-stabilized apartments and failure to report $75,000 in income, as well as his protection of a tax loophole that favored one of his donors. Within a week of the House Ethics Committee's Feb. 25, 2010, report on Rangel\u2019s improper junket, Sutton announced that she was giving the $7,000 she got from Rangel to charity. Sutton subsequently called on Rangel to resignfrom the House of Representatives.Slepian says Renacci\u2019s decision to wait until the FBI probe is complete before deciding whether to get rid of the the Suarez money parallels Sutton\u2019s decision to wait. But does it?The Rangel conduct under investigation had nothing to do with Sutton or the donations Rangel made to her campaign. The FBI\u2019s investigation specifically involves donations made to Renacci.Also, Rangel was being probed by the House Ethics Committee for violating House of Representative rules. The FBI is probing donations to Renacci as potential crimes.And the amounts of money involved are significantly different: $7,000 from Rangel to Sutton\u2019s campaign; more than $100,000 from Suarez employees to Renacci\u2019s campaign. Data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics says Suarez is Renacci\u2019s biggest political donor.Regardless, the claim on the Truth-O-Meter is Renacci\u2019s statement to the town hall audience that \"my opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.\"PolitiFact Ohio doesn\u2019t play \"gotcha\" games. To their credit, the folks in the Renacci camp acknowledged he provided incorrect information to the crowd in Rocky River.But to those in attendance, the information they have to go on is what Renacci told them that night. That\u2019s why the comment merits a check from PolitiFact Ohio.On the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci\u2019s statement rates False.",

In an op-ed announcing the effort, Bloomberg \u2014 who has since entered the Democratic presidential primary race \u2014 touted an existing partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Sierra Club that has \"shut down 289 coal-fired power plants since 2011.\" The new initiative would build on this effort and also \"work to stop the construction of new gas plants,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"By the time they are built, they will be out of date because renewable energy will be cheaper.\" Justice, a Republican whose state is a leading producer of coal and other carbon-based energy, said the effort could be \"catastrophic\" to West Virginia. (Justice himself also inherited a coal mining business and continues to own several mines.) At one point in the press conference, Justice was asked about the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. He responded by questioning the value of the United States cutting back if China is using carbon-based fuels on full blast. \"How does it make sense that in China, they\u2019re burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we\u2019re burning in the United States?\" Justice asked. Is his comparison accurate? Justice\u2019s ratio is not far from the reported data, though it\u2019s worth noting that the reason for the discrepancy has a lot to do with the fact that China has a much larger population. (His office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) There\u2019s little doubt that, as a whole, coal consumption by China is several times larger than it is in the United States. According to the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, China\u2019s coal consumption was 1.91 billion tons of oil equivalent in 2018. In the same year, the United States consumed 317 million tons. That means China consumed about six times as much coal as the United States did. Another data source, the Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2019 published by Enerdata, an energy intelligence and consulting firm, found a nearly identical difference \u2014 China was about six times larger than the U.S. in consumption of coal and lignite (a low-efficiency type of coal). Justice didn\u2019t mention it, but another country, India, also consumes more coal than the United States does \u2014 452 million tons of oil equivalent, according to the BP review. We\u2019ll note that the difference in coal consumption between China and the United States is partially explained by the two countries\u2019 difference in population \u2014 China has about 4.3 times higher in population than the United States. However, adjusting for population is less significant in this case than it often is, given Justice\u2019s point. Justice is arguing that greenhouse gases do not stay within national borders; they spread everywhere in the atmosphere. So any decreases in carbon emissions made in the United States will be a relatively small factor compared to China in the global context \u2014 regardless of which country has a bigger population. Indeed, according to the BP data, China accounted for just over half of the world\u2019s coal consumption in 2018. In addition, the same data shows that China\u2019s coal consumption increased by 1.8% between 2007 and 2017, whereas U.S. coal consumption declined by 4.9%. Unlike the United States, which has a lot of economically competitive natural gas under development, China doesn\u2019t, said Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow in energy studies at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. \"China has to go against the economic calculus to retire at least some of the coal if it wants to lower emission levels,\" she said. \"This is why we see China still consuming so much.\" Mikulska added that the current trade friction with China \"does not help, as China turns more to domestic or regional resources due to energy security concerns. One of them is coal.\" That said, the Paris-based International Energy Agency, has projected that China\u2019s coal consumption will indeed decline over the next two decades. \"This new direction will have consequences that are no less significant for China and the world than its earlier period of energy-intensive development.\" Justice said that China today is \"burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we\u2019re burning in the United States.\" The actual number is a little bit less than that \u2014 China consumes roughly six times the amount of coal as the United States does. But that\u2019s pretty close. We rate the statement Mostly True.",

(Photo: India Today/Riddhish Dutta) Communal violence occurred during a Hanuman Jayanti procession in northwest Delhi's Jahangirpuri area on April 16. According to the police, nine people, including eight police personnel and a resident, were injured. Police arrested fourteen people for rioting and attempting to murder, among other charges. Following this, a photo has gone viral with claims it showed the violence in Jahangirpuri. It showed a policeman lying on the road, possibly injured, and a man appearing to aim a stone at him. People shared the photo on Twitter alongside hashtags like #DelhiRiots and #Jahangirpuri. Archived versions of similar posts can be seen here and here. The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral image was almost three years old and not from Delhi. It was from an anti-CAA protest in Ahmedabad. AFWA Probe Reverse-searching the photo led us to a December 20, 2019, Tweet by IPS officer Pankaj Nain. The photo in the old tweet proved it did not belong to the recent Jahangirpuri clash. The reverse image search also led us to a report from the news portal Desh Gujarat from December 20, 2019. The report carrying the photo was about a protest that broke out in the Shah Alam area of Ahmedabad. Further searches led us to a Times of India report that carried the same image on December 20, 2019. The caption said, \"People attack a policeman in Shah-E-Alam area in Ahmedabad on Thursday.\" The report noted that a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) turned violent in Ahmedabad. It resulted in at least 30 people getting injured, including 12 cops. So, while cops were injured in the Jahangirpuri violence on April 16, we concluded that the photo shared on social media did not capture that. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Photo shows a mob in Delhi's Jahangirpuri attacking a cop during the communal clashes during a Hanuman Jayanti procession on April 16. Conclusion Although there are reports of policemen getting injured during the clash, the viral image captured violence at an anti-CAA protest in Ahmedabad in December 2019.

In late August 2021, numerous news reports surfaced claiming zoologists in Michigan were giving COVID-19 vaccines to some animals. The reports were true. In a news release available on the website of the Detroit Zoo, the state\u2019s biggest zoo, which is located in a Detroit suburb, administrators announced the following on Aug. 30: The Detroit Zoological Society (DZS) has begun to vaccinate animals who are believed to be most susceptible to COVID-19. Use of the special vaccine, which was developed exclusively for animals by veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis, has been authorized on a case-by-case basis by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers and lions are the first to receive doses. \u201cThe animals routinely get other vaccinations. Many of the mammals are trained to present themselves to our animal care staff for minor medical procedures, including vaccinations. We\u2019re both thankful and relieved a special vaccine is now available to protect against COVID-19,\u201d said Scott Carter, chief life sciences officer for the DZS. Since the early months of the pandemic, zoo animals have caught SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, though instances of such infections are rare. Humans can pass the virus to animals, especially if they\u2019re in close contact with each other, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For example, tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo became infected in April 2020, and a gorilla troop at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park tested positive shortly after that, according to National Geographic. No animal at the Detroit Zoo had tested positive, as of the news release\u2019s announcement, which meant the vaccinations aimed to prevent possible future outbreaks. \u201cMuch like we vaccinate dogs for things like parvovirus, distemper or rabies, this is needed to protect animals at the zoo,\u201d said Dr. Ann Duncan, the society\u2019s director of animal health, in the release. Mahesh Kumar, a leader of global biologics at Zoetis, told National Geographic for an Aug. 20 story that he was was overseeing dozens of agreements with zoos (including the Detroit Zoo\u2019s) and requests to the USDA and state veterinarians to inoculate animals against the virus. (National Geographic was the first to report on Zoetis\u2019 first vaccine recipients \u2014 great apes at the San Diego Zoo \u2014 in February.) According to Science Magazine, the company\u2019s vaccine works similarily to the Novavax vaccine for humans by inoculating animals with an antigen that gets their immune systems to fight SARS-Co-V-2 upon infection. Meanwhile, scientists were urging for more research to determine the full extent to which COVID-19 threatened the animal kingdom. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know all of the animals that can get infected,\u201d the CDC stated. \u201cMore studies are need to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.\u201d So far, positive COVID-19 reports included the following, according to the CDC: Sources: \u201cFirst Great Apes at U.S. Zoo Receive COVID-19 Vaccine Made for Animals.\u201d Animals, 3 Mar. 2021, https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/first-great-apes-at-us-zoo-receive-coronavirus-vaccine-made-for-animals.

The U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard Richard and Mildred Loving\u2019s case and ruled state statutes banning interracial marriage unconstitutional.But, \"in 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married,\" Oliver (D-Essex) said on Jan. 9. \"Without question, Senator (Stephen) Sweeney said it best: this is a civil rights issue. It is a snapshot in time in the history of our country issue. And I think for those of us that believe in equality, equality, equality, marriage equality represents the third leg on the stool of civil rights and equality in this country.\"A spokesman said Oliver based her statistic on a New York Times article published earlier this month. It put the number of states where interracial marriage was illegal in 1958 at 16.It\u2019s actually more than that, PolitiFact New Jersey found.Oregonrepealed its law in 1951, becoming the first state to do so since Ohio in 1887. Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota followed suit.By 1958, two dozen states still prohibited interracial marriage: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.Although California still technically had a miscegenation law on its books in 1958, \"once the state Supreme Court declared the law invalid in the 1948 Perez V. Sharp case, it was no longer legally enforceable. So from 1948 on, California is put into the \u2018legal column,\u2019\" Renee Romano, the author of \"Race Mixing: Black-White Marriage in Postwar America\" and an associate professor of history at Oberlin College in Ohio, said in an email.\"The Speaker was responsibly relying upon the data graphic included in that New York Times [article],\" Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, wrote in an email. \"The Speaker\u2019s overall point was to note that same-sex couples continue to suffer from the same wrongful discrimination that interracial couples such as the Lovings and many, many others endured until the Supreme Court rightly put a stop to it.\"By the time the Supreme Court unanimously ruled miscegenation laws unconstitutional in 1967, 16 states still had such statutes.\"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State,\" then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the opinion for the court for the Loving v. Virginia case.Romano said the analogy between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage isn\u2019t exactly parallel, but it\u2019s powerful.If you can make the case that 50 years ago people supported bans on interracial marriage, but \"now, we know that it goes on and it\u2019s no big deal, you can sort of use that,\" she said, to say in another 50 years, people may ask \"what the hullabaloo is about. It\u2019s a really powerful analogy. There\u2019s a lot of richness there politically.\"Our rulingOliver claimed that 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958.

        "doc": "In an effort to limit southwest border crossings, U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, proposed a bill that would require authorities to deny U.S. entry to migrants seeking asylum as long as the U.S. doesn\u2019t have space to detain them. Roy bashed President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of border crossings, saying most people encountered by border authorities have settled in the United States. \"Under Biden, we have seen over 4.6 MILLION encounters at our southern border. Most have been released into the interior and will stay here indefinitely,\" Roy said in a Jan. 23 Twitter thread. \"This is no accident. Biden has shown the world that our borders are open and vulnerable to exploitation.\" PLUS, Under Biden, we have seen over 4.6 MILLION encounters at our southern border. Most have been released into the interior and will stay here indefinitely.This is no accidentBiden has shown the world that our borders are open and vulnerable to exploitation U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows Roy is close on the encounters figure. But his claim that most people are staying here indefinitely is unsupported. Roy\u2019s office did not respond to our request for evidence supporting his claim. CBP did not comment on the record, and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to our query. From February 2021, Biden\u2019s first full month in office, to December 2022, the latest month with available data, there were 4.5 million encounters with migrants at the southern border. This includes encounters recorded by border officers at official ports of entry, and by Border Patrol agents stationed between those ports of entry. Roy's count includes encounters in January 2021, even though Biden was not president for most of that month. Border encounters data represent the number of times officials stopped immigrants, not the number of individual immigrants stopped. If one person tries crossing the border three times, for example, that\u2019s recorded as three encounters. Roy\u2019s claim that most of the immigrants encountered were released into the U.S. isn't accurate, immigration experts told PolitiFact. When immigrants are stopped at the border by Border Patrol, they are either immediately expelled under Title 42, a public health order, or they are apprehended under immigration law. Some people are sent to a detention facility, some are released into the U.S. to await asylum proceedings, and some are forced to leave the country. Theresa Cardinal Brown, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior adviser on immigration and border policy, told PolitiFact that Roy\u2019s claim about immigrants staying here indefinitely \"certainly wasn\u2019t true,\" in fiscal year 2022 (Oct. 1, 2021, to Sept. 30, 2022). Most people were either expelled under Title 42 or deported under immigration law, she said. A PolitiFact analysis found that about 53% of the encounters during the Biden administration resulted in immigrants being sent out of the U.S. About 2.1 million of those encounters led to expulsions under the Title 42 public health order. Under Biden\u2019s administration, at least 500,000 immigrants have been detained as they await their court hearings, said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Others who have been let into the country and applied for asylum may ultimately be deported if they can\u2019t persuade an immigration judge to let them stay. Asylum approvals are \"not guaranteed and would be false to state that most will stay indefinitely,\" Ruiz Soto said. Some people let into the U.S. are enrolled into programs under the Alternatives to Detention umbrella; these usually require that they check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement via a phone app as they await their court hearings. Others have been given a notice to appear at immigration court at a later date. Officials decide enrollment case by case. Immigration authorities also let in some people under parole, which allows immigrants to stay in the U.S. temporarily. Once in the U.S., parolees can try to adjust their status for lawful permanent residency. Recently, the Biden administration created a parole program for immigrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela to enter the U.S. and work for two years. Because encounters data represent events, not individuals, it\u2019s difficult to know precisely how many people attempted to come into the country. Roy tweeted that \"under Biden, we have seen over 4.6 MILLION encounters at our southern border. Most have been released into the interior and will stay here indefinitely.\" He is basically right about the number of encounters: There were about 4.5 million immigration encounters at the southern border from Biden\u2019s first full month in office to December 2022. But most of these immigrants have not been released into the U.S. At least 2.1 million encounters ended in immediate expulsions under a public health order. Among the people allowed in, about 500,000 immigrants were detained while they await immigration court hearings. The rest were released into the country. These numbers also represent initial outcomes. Just because immigrants are released into the U.S. to seek asylum, does not mean they will stay indefinitely.

        "claim": "A video shows Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.",
        "doc": "We\u2019ve seen ads that support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president employ artificial intelligence to malign DeSantis\u2019 opponents and boost DeSantis. But a recent anti-DeSantis video used AI to do the opposite. \"BREAKING NEWS: Governor Ron DeSantis drops out of the 2024 Republican presidential primary,\" proclaimed a Sept. 1 post on X, formerly Twitter, that showed a two-minute video in which DeSantis sat at a desk and appeared to announce he was terminating his campaign. In the clip, DeSantis appeared to be saying, \"After the last week\u2019s events, including my poor performance at the debate as well as President Trump rejoining X, I\u2019ve realized I need to drop out of this race immediately.\" The X account that posted the clip goes by \"Steven Savage,\" a self-described digital creator. A day later, the account told its followers the video was \"obviously a #DeepFake meme, and was created for entertainment purposes only. Laugh, retweet, and like! \ud83d\udc4d\" DeSantis spokesperson Bryan Griffin also confirmed to PolitiFact that the video is fake. Experts say there were some telltale signs that would have tipped people off to the video\u2019s inauthenticity. But in an era in which deepfakes are gaining prominence in politics, it\u2019s worth identifying those signs and explaining how such a video entered the political discussion. Deepfakes are machine-generated audio or video that alter faces, bodies or voices to make people appear to do or say things they never did or said. It appears that the DeSantis deepfake video was originally posted Sept. 1 by the X account \"C3PMeme\" \u2014 a self-described \"meme making droid\" \u2014 with the caption, \"What Ron DeSantis should say but won't ... #deepfake.\" What Ron DeSantis should say but won't... #deepfakeCollab w @Ramble_Rants & @LEAHmemes pic.twitter.com/gKvU3XQJC2 It tagged two accounts, Ramble_Rants and LEAHmemes, as collaborators. C3PMeme and Ramble_Rants have blue check marks. The marks previously proved that account owners were who they said they were. But today they are available only to X Premium subscribers who pay $8 per month, entitling them to display the check mark (or not) and receive other benefits such as higher post visibility and the ability to post longer videos and edit posts after publication. X says it reviews subscriber applicants to ensure they don\u2019t have signs of inauthenticity, but critics have said the system doesn\u2019t do enough to discourage imposter accounts. C3PMeme and Ramble_Rants appear to be part of a network of accounts supported by the \"Dilley Meme Team,\" owned by Counter Productions Digital Media, which lists \"deepfakes & shallowfakes\" among its services. Its site says, \"From head swaps and CGI shallowfakes to elaborate Al infused deepfakes, no one will ever know the difference but us!\" CGI stands for computer-generated imagery. Shallowfakes are doctored videos made with simple video editing software; deepfakes, by contrast, require artificial intelligence technology. The other tagged collaborator, LEAHmemes, is a private account with no followers. It seems to be a mistag of \"itsreallyleah,\" another self-described meme account supported by the same digital media company. C3PMeme has tagged itsreallyleah in a past collaboration. The three accounts posted the video around the same time Sept. 1 and collectively gained over 100,000 views. Only C3PMeme\u2019s post labeled it as a deepfake. A YouTube channel with the same name, C3PMeme, also posted the video on the same day. Its caption said it was \"a deepfake of what Ron DeSantis might say if he dropped out of the race (which he should).\" We also looked for the original source video, and a reverse-image search of the video\u2019s frames showed that it matched an Aug. 15 virtual press conference DeSantis held with local media in New England. During the briefing, DeSantis did not say anything about exiting the presidential race \u2014 a significant development that would have generated news headlines ahead of the 2024 elections. But there were no such credible news reports. University of California, Berkeley professor Hany Farid and University at Buffalo professor Siwei Lyu, who both teach computer science courses, told PolitiFact they concluded that the video is a deepfake. Farid said it combined an AI-generated voice and a stock video of DeSantis, with a mouth and lower jaw generated to match the new audio track. Lyu said the audio was likely created with a text-to-speech synthesis method. Farid detected that the audio to video sync was misaligned in multiple places. Lyu pointed out that the voice lacks breathing sounds and that the teeth are \"often blurry and inconsistent across frames.\" Farid and Lyu said creating this type of deepfake is \"fairly easy.\" The tools needed to make such a video are available online, some low-cost or free. \"It is fairly clear that this video was not explicitly intended to be deceptive: the YouTube channel clearly labels it as a fake. However, once this video is taken from YouTube (where it is clearly labeled) and starts making the rounds on Twitter/TikTok, etc. this disclosure may be lost,\" Farid said in an email. \"I think we should be concerned about the rapid development of deepfake technology because it is going to make it more difficult for voters to reason about what candidates did and did not say.\" As Farid predicted, the video spread on social media platforms, including Twitter and TikTok, without any label identifying its original context as a deepfake. These misrepresented videos gained thousands of views. A video of DeSantis supposedly showed him announcing that he is dropping out of the presidential race. But it was originally posted by a meme account that labeled it as a \"deepfake.\" The source video is from an Aug. 15 press briefing, in which DeSantis doesn\u2019t mention dropping out of the race. We rate this claim False.",

        "claim": "Says President Donald Trump is \"waging a trade war against WI farmers --forcing >1600 dairy farms to close.\"",
        "doc": "It\u2019s a tough time to be the Dairy State. The family farms that long formed the backbone of the state\u2019s milk production are increasingly being forced out of business. And the U.S. agriculture secretary came to town andcast doubt on the future viability of any small dairy farms. U.S. Rep.Mark Pocan, D-Madison, says Wisconsinites should lay the blame at the feet of President Donald Trump. In a Dec. 2, 2019, tweet, Pocan said Trump is \"waging a trade war against WI farmers \u2014 forcing more than1600 dairy farms to close.\" Trade tensions are certainly having an impact, but is it reasonable to blame them \u2014 and Trump \u2014 for that many closures? Pocan\u2019s is roughly correct on the number of closures. Wisconsin had 9,288 dairy farms on Feb. 1, 2017 \u2014 about two weeks after Trump was sworn in. By Dec. 1, 2019, that number dropped to 7,337, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That\u2019s a loss of 1,951 farms, even more than Pocan referenced. But Wisconsin dairy farms closing is hardly a new trend. The number of milking operations here has plummeted by more than half in the last 15 years, from 15,000 at the end of 2004 to about 7,300 as of December 2019. That trend has indeed worsened under Trump, however. In the 34 months since Trump\u2019s election Wisconsin has lost an average of 57 dairy farms per month. In the 34 months before that, the monthly average was 33 farms. Pocan blamed the closures not only on Trump, but specifically on the president\u2019s trade wars. Defending the claim, Pocan spokesman Usamah Andrabi pointed to a category of Chinese dairy exports that dropped from mid-2018 to mid-2019 amid retaliatory tariffs. \"That being said, I think we can reasonably attribute the majority of these farm closures to the effects of China\u2019s tariffs/Trump\u2019s trade war,\" Andrabi said. That\u2019s simply not accurate. Pocan\u2019s claim \u2014 and his spokesman\u2019s defense \u2014 oversimplify an industry facing a complex set of economic pressures. How do Wisconsinites feel about President Trump? Well, he's:\u2716\ufe0f Waging a trade war against WI farmers--forcing >1600 dairy farms to close\u2716\ufe0f Refusing to protect workers or enact environmental standards in the USMCA\u2716\ufe0f Undermining folks' healthcare access.How do you think? pic.twitter.com/bjN7hL2Wn1 Low milk prices, historic levels of oversupply and changing consumer demand were dealing devastating blows to dairy farmers long before Trump picked a fight with China. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel summarized the demand struggles this way as part of its Dairyland in Distress project, an exhaustive examination of the state\u2019s trademark industry. Sales of milk as a beverage have fallen steadily since the 1970s, with fewer parents encouraging their children to drink milk than ever before. Soy milk and almond milk \u2014 which dairy farmers point out aren't real milk \u2014 and scores of sports drinks have flooded the beverage market. And although consumption of cheese, yogurt and butter have all increased, they've not always kept pace with runaway production. Today, for instance, U.S. commercial and government cheese stockpiles are at about 1 billion pounds \u2014 the highest level in a century. At the same time, foreign markets for American dairy products have shrunk in response to tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on foreign steel and aluminum. Cheese shipments to China have fallen almost 65 percent, according to industry figures, and exports to Mexico are down more than 10 percent. So tariffs are a factor in limiting demand, but far from the only one. And supply is a major problem as well. Advances in genetics and feed science mean the average cow today produces about four times more milk than it would have in the 1950s. This leads to a market saturation that both generates waste \u2014 some farmers are forced to dump milk down the drain for lack of a buyer \u2014 and contributes to reduced prices. Milk prices have nudged up in recent months but before that went through a yearslong downturn that often left prices below the break-even point for farms. \"There were four years of the depressed milk prices before the trade war started,\" Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition, told PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"If you go back and you look, we've always had attrition going on.\" Pocan said Trump is \"waging a trade war against WI farmers\" that has forced more than 1,600 dairy farms to close. Setting aside the rhetorical overreach of calling it a trade war \"against\" state farmers, Pocan\u2019s finger-pointing is off the mark. Wisconsin has lost that many dairy farms \u2014 slightly more even \u2014 since Trump took office. Trade wars certainly haven\u2019t helped, and accordingly farm closures have increased under Trump. But it\u2019s not reasonable to attribute all the closures to Trump and trade tension when this trend dates back more than a decade. Milk prices, over-production and changing consumer demand have all played key roles in devastating the dairyland economy and shuttering Wisconsin farms. Pocan\u2019s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That\u2019s what we call Mostly False.",

        "claim": "A Republican housing finance reform bill \"would eliminate a person\u2019s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages.\"",
        "doc": "After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the federal government created entities to encourage families to buy houses and banks to make home loans. The Federal Housing Administration, founded in 1934, issues mortgage insurance to guarantee banks they will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn\u2019t make payments. That made it easier for banks to approve mortgages for people who don\u2019t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit. Fannie Mae and later Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises, were created to buy up, bundle and sell mortgages as mortgage-backed securities on the open market. That gave lenders more money to make home loans. But by 2008, Uncle Sam had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the recession took hold. And several years later, FHA was also in financial straits. Those developments helped precipitate a move in July 2013 by Republican leaders of the House Financial Services Committee. They announced they would introduce the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH), aiming at largely removing the government from the financing of home purchases. That prompted U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a member of the committee, to go on the attack. \"This radical bill would push the dream of home ownership further and further out of reach for Wisconsin families. The so-called PATH Act is, in actuality, the PATH to Nowhere,\" the Wisconsin Democrat charged in a July 24, 2013 news release. The bill, Moore continued, \"would eliminate a person\u2019s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages \u2013 the cornerstone of our housing finance system.\" Let\u2019s see if that\u2019s so. Moore's evidence Moore spokeswoman Staci Cox told us that when Moore referred to \"a person\u2019s\" ability to obtain a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, she meant the \"average American.\" To back the statement, Cox highlighted testimony made to the House Financial Services Committee by Mark Zandi, chief economist for the Moody's Analytics economic research firm. He said the PATH bill would put 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans \"out of reach for most Americans.\" Without the government guarantees, mortgage rates would increase, adding $130 per month to the cost of a mortgage for the typical borrower, Zandi said. And while three-quarters of mortgage loans currently are fixed rate, that would drop to 20 percent to 25 percent, he said. Moore also cites opposition to aspects of the bill from several major players in housing. The National Association of Home Builders, for example, said the bill would \"greatly limit homeownership\" for \"many qualified Americans\"; and the Credit Union National Association said it feared the bill could not \"ensure continuation of long-term fixed-rate mortgage products.\" So, Moore doesn\u2019t have hard evidence that the PATH bill would eliminate the ability of a person to get a traditional mortgage; that remains to be seen. But experts say such mortgages could become unavailable or unaffordable for many people. GOP response The PATH bill, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in five years and limit the focus of the FHA's mortgage insurance to first-time home buyers with moderate incomes. Jeff Emerson, a staff member of the House Financial Services Committee, gave us a response to Moore's claim. Emerson cited a Washington Post editorial that rebutted the assertion that 30-year mortgages would go away. The editorial noted that 30-year fixed-rate loans known as jumbo mortgages \"already exist without government help,\" saying: \"Presumably private-sector innovation could create loan products, with 30-year terms or otherwise, appropriate for smaller borrowers as well.\" But current jumbo mortgages require a borrower to have a higher income, a good credit score and typically a 30 percent down payment, according to Realtor.com. Emerson also said PATH \"is designed to create more opportunities for more choices, including the 30-year fixed rate loan. The market will respond to customer demand, as it always does.\" So, while there is no indication that traditional mortgages would cease to exist, neither of Emerson's points are evidence that they would remain as available as they are with today's government guarantees. Other evidence Other experts, while disagreeing on the overall impact of PATH on traditional fixed-rate mortgages, acknowledge that the elimination of government guarantees or subsidies inevitably means that the terms of such mortgages would change. Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin, whose specialties include housing finance, agreed with Zandi. He testified to House Financial Services Committee that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is \"heavily a function of federal backing of the housing finance system\" and that if PATH became law, \"it would be difficult for most American families to obtain 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages.\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, andMark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, testified that affordable fixed-rate mortgages would still be offered, but they weren\u2019t specific. Calabria noted the current availability of fixed-rate jumbo home mortgages, as well as fixed-rate auto loans. In a New York Times opinion column, University of Maryland public policy professor Phillip Swagel, who is also a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, praised the PATH bill. But he acknowledged that without government guarantees, mortgage interest rates would rise, though \"it is hard to know quite how much.\" He also stated the housing market \"is in an upswing and affordability remains high, so it seems likely that the housing sector would continue to recover even with higher rates.\" Our rating Moore stated that a Republican bill to largely privatize the nation\u2019s housing finance system \"would eliminate a person\u2019s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages.\" It's unknown how exactly the effects of the bill would play out. But there is reason to believe that without government guarantees, traditional home mortgages would become less available, less affordable, or both, for many Americans.

There is no evidence that the Maui wildfires were intentionally set \u2013 as part of an effort to convert the island into a \u201c15-minute city,\u201d \u201csmart city\u201d or otherwise. The cause of the fires has not yet been determined, but officials say red flag conditions and strong winds from nearby Hurricane Dora were likely factors.The deadliest U.S. wildfire in over a century, the fires in Maui have killed at least 115 people and destroyed upwards of 2,800 structures across the island since Aug. 8. The disaster prompted the Hawaiian government to declare a state of emergency on Aug. 9.USA TODAY previously reported that a combination of weather and climate-related factors created what the National Weather Service calls \u201cred flag\u201d conditions on the island. Those factors \u2013 which include gusting winds (fuelled by nearby Hurricane Dora), low humidity, lack of rainfall and dry vegetation \u2013 can lead to increased risk of fire danger.Fact check: No evidence Maui wildfires intentionally set in 'land grab,' contrary to postsWhile the exact cause of the fires is still being investigated, Department of Defense spokesperson Jeffrey Hickman previously told USA TODAY the claim the fires were deliberately set is a baseless \u201csocial media narrative.\u201dHawaii Gov. Josh Green\u2019s office previously told the Associated Press there is \u201cno truth to the horrendous assertion that the fires were deliberately set.\u201dThe post references the \u201c15-minute cities\u201d concept created by Carlos Moreno, a professor at the University of Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. The basic concept is that all essential services are accessible to all city residents within a 15-minute walk or bike ride.But the urban design framework has no connection to the Maui wildfires, as USA TODAY has previously reported.The post also appears to conflate the \u201c15-minute cities\u201d concept with \u201csmart cities\u201d and the JUMPSmart Maui Project.The project aimed \u201cto establish electric vehicle charging infrastructure and smart-grid EV technology,\u201d according to John Harrison, program director for the Maui Economic Development Board.But Harrison said the program, which began in 2011, \u201cconcluded successfully\u201d in 2017 and is no longer active.Furthermore, it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a goal of the project to turn Maui into either a \u201c15-minute city\u201d or a \u201csmart island,\" Harrison said.The Maui Economic Development board is \u201cnot aware of any plans to turn Maui into a smart island or 15-minute city,\u201d he told USA TODAY.Fact check: No, Maui fires not linked to energy weapons, AI, smart cities, weather modificationSome of the social media posts making this claim also mention the Hawaii International Conference for System Sciences, which has been held across the state since 1968.The event, which most recently convened in January, \u201chas been known worldwide as the longest-standing working scientific conferences in Information Technology Management,\u201d with panels and presentations featuring experts from upwards of 60 countries, according to its website.USA TODAY has previously debunked other erroneous claims about \"15-minute cities,\" including that they are actually climate change lockdowns, that they will permanently limit citizens\u2019 mobility, and that the East Palestine train derailment was designed to forcibly impose a \u201c15-minute city\u201d in Cleveland.USA TODAY reached out to the Instagram user who shared the post for comment but did not receive an immediate response.The Associated Press also debunked this claim.Thank you for supporting our journalism.

        "claim": "\"Two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the school department\" about residents in the state's sex offender registry.",
        "doc": "Rhode Island state law and state Parole Board guidelines say residents in the community must be notified if a Level 2 or Level 3 (moderate or high-risk) sex offender is living in their neighborhood. Notifications are also supposed to be sent to schools, police departments, daycare centers and community organizations that might have contact with the offender. The costs associated with that requirement were raised at an April 11 hearing before the House Finance Committee. At issue was House bill 5557, submitted at the request of the attorney general's office, which would revise the state's sex offender registry system to comply with federal guidelines. Under the bill, responsibility for notifying residents, schools, community organizations and businesses such as daycare centers about sex offenders living in the vicinity would shift from city and town police departments to the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, which includes the state police. During the hearing, two witnesses made interesting comments about how the proposal would cut notification costs for cities and towns. One was Rep. Peter Palumbo, D-Cranston, whose statement is being fact-checked separately. The other -- and the subject of this item -- was Joee (pronounced Joey) Lindbeck, a special assistant attorney general who heads the office's Legislation and Policy Unit. \"Two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the School Department\" about sex offenders. \"This act would allow for e-mail notification alone,\" she said. That seemed like a lot of money, so we decided to check that portion of her statement. Because the data came from a report from the attorney general\u2019s office, we made that our first stop. That office sent us a 2012 PowerPoint presentation that included cost estimates from several communities. There was quite a range. We've ranked the communities by the number of current Level 2 and Level 3 offenders (listed in parentheses) because a community that tends to have more offenders is going to have to spend more. It's important to note that the number of offenders may have been different when these cost estimates were developed and that some may have ended up back in the Adult Correctional Institutions on a new charge or violating probation after they registered. Per notification Per year Providence (163) $50,000 Cranston (124) $9,137 Pawtucket (39) $3,261 Woonsocket (38) $1,500 West Warwick (16) $22,784 Central Falls (16) $123 Warwick (15) $1,365 Coventry (11) $5,657 Cumberland (5) $4,000 Newport (4) $2,000 West Greenwich (4) $2,000 Johnston (3) $11,000 Hopkinton (3) $2,550 Smithfield (2) \"Minimal\" Middletown (1) $1,000 Richmond (0) $1,000 When we asked about the source of the Providence number, the attorney general's office produced a memo from Police Chief Hugh Clements reporting the cost was \"approximately $50,000 [that year] for the registry and notifications. [Detective Teddy Michael] indicated that the bulk of the cost is related to the notifications to the schools.\" Providence currently has 39 schools. So the $50,000 was not just for school notifications, although most of it was. David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Angel Taveras, said the total was $65,000 in 2009, $36,000 in 2010 and $55,000 in 2011. How much of that was spent on school notifications? Ortiz referred us to the Police Department, where Detective Sgt. Philip Hartnett, recently put in charge of Providence police's special victims unit, said firm numbers are not available. He said Detective Michael estimated that the schools took up roughly 60 percent to 65 percent of the money. The costs were high, Hartnett said, because in 2011, the department has routinely sent notices to individual homes of students, although it was not required. \"There are 26,000 students in Providence and it had to be something like that two years ago,\" he said. \"I was amazed by that myself, but it was out of an abundance of caution. The law actually says to notify the schools. They took the step to notify the parents of all the students.\" Christina O'Reilly, spokeswoman for the Providence School Department, said when it gets a notice from police, it generates labels for all the students attending each school located within a half mile of a Level 2 offender or within one mile of a Level 3 offender. The labels go to the Police Department, which sends out the mailings, 45 of which have gone out since September. Bus drivers and principals are also notified by the School Department. Hartnett said there are efforts underway to streamline the system. \"Now we are trying to set up an automated telephone system so that a call would go out to each student when we notify the school.\" The department was also trying to come up with posters, but with so many sex offenders to track in Providence, the posters quickly became outdated, he said. As Lindbeck told us, \"The real problem is, they move so much and you have to redo this every time they move.\" Our ruling Special Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck testified that \"two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the School Department\" about residents in the state's sex offender registry. She was correctly quoting a memo regarding the approximate dollar amount but incorrectly attributed all of the spending on notifications to the School Department. On the one hand, everyone we spoke with said the biggest chunk of money went for school notifications. On the other, it's clear from the people with whom we spoke that a significant chunk of that money went to notifying other entities as well. We rate her statement Half True.

        "claim": "A Republican proposal changes Medicare for those under age 55 so that they will \"participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do.\"",
        "doc": "Correction: This item was originally published at about noon on April 13, 2011, based on ABC's transcript of \"This Week With Christiane Amanpour.\" Shortly afterward, Pence's press office notified us that the transcript text was wrong -- leaving out the words \"kind of.\" Listening to the exchange on video, we confirmed the error in our original ruling. As a result, we are republishing this item at about 6 p.m. on April 13 with the correct quote from Pence and have upgraded the ruling from False to Barely True. Republicans have better proposals than Democrats to rein in future federal spending, said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., in an appearance on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. \"House Republicans under Paul Ryan's leadership have offered a vision to put America back on a pathway toward a balanced budget,\" Pence said. \"It deals with issues in entitlements. It reduces the national debt. For Americans 55 or older, we're not proposing a single change in Medicare... What we want to do for Americans under the age of 55 is make sure they can participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do.\" Pence\u2019s final claim about Medicare drew a response from Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who was also on the show. \"That is not accurate,\" Van Hollen said. \"Members of Congress have what is called a fair-share deal. We do not bear the entire risk of increased costs. They are asking seniors to bear risks (that) they are not asking themselves.\" Pence replied, \"Members of Congress have the same premium support system, Chris knows that.\" We decided to see who was right by fact-checking Pence\u2019s statement that future Medicare beneficiaries will be able to \"participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do.\" The Medicare proposal Pence and Van Hollen mentioned comes from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chair of the House Budget Committee. His 2012 budget proposal, called The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America\u2019s Promise, lays out many ways to reduce federal spending, including changes to entitlement programs including Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 or older. Right now, Medicare is a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan\u2019s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government \"premium support\" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (Ryan\u2019s plan specifically says this is not a \"voucher\" program, since the government will pay the insurance companies directly.) Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Here\u2019s how Ryan\u2019s plan explains it: \"When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.\" Ryan\u2019s proposal requires the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is how members of Congress buy their insurance. Additionally, Ryan\u2019s plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium supports to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan\u2019s proposal and found that it will save the government money.But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance. \"A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare,\" the CBO concluded. Now let\u2019s look at how whether proposal looks like what members of Congress can buy. \u2022 How the plan is like what members of Congress get. We contacted Pence\u2019s office to ask about how the Ryan proposal is like what members of Congress get, and they pointed us to the fact that Medicare plans from private insurers will be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. We should also note that seniors would be able to compare different plans and select from different insurance options, as members of Congress do. The government would pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. \u2022 How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, as Van Hollen pointed out, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise their rates, through a formula he mentioned known as \"Fair Share.\" Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan\u2019s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it\u2019s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs,\" the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report. Our ruling We should emphasize that Ryan\u2019s Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, and there are many unanswered questions about it. But what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the kind of employer-provided health insurance that members of Congress receive. At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and will likely not have the same options to buy more expensive plans.

        "claim": "Law professor Alice Ristroph wrote in the Atlantic magazine that the 2017 solar eclipse, its path, or those who viewed it, were \"racist.\"",
        "doc": "In August 2017, two right-wing web sites falsely reported that a law professor had written that a 2017 solar eclipse was \u201cracist.\u201d First, the Daily Caller published an article headlined \u201cThe Eclipse Is Racist Because It Fails to Affect Enough Black People, the Atlantic Suggests,\u201d stating that \u201cThe Atlantic, a once-great magazine, has determined that the total eclipse of the sun due to occur on Monday will fail to affect enough black people.\u201d The following day, the Conservative Tribune asserted in a similar vein: \u201cAre you looking forward to Monday\u2019s solar eclipse \u2014 the first full eclipse to hit the United States in decades? You filthy, filthy racist. That\u2019s at least the take of Brooklyn Law School professor Alice Ristroph, who used a staggering 4,544 words in The Atlantic to explaining why the phenomenon of the moon blocking the sun just wasn\u2019t diverse enough for her tastes.\u201d Both web sites were referring to an essay by Alice Ristroph, a professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York. Her essay, originally published in Democracy under the title \u201cBlackout,\u201d and republished by the Atlantic on 18 August 2017, did not state \u2014 or even imply \u2014 that the eclipse itself or the path of its totality were \u201cracist.\u201d Nor did Ristroph say or imply that the eclipse would not be visible to \u201cenough\u201d black people, or that those who chose to view the eclipse were \u201cracists.\u201d Instead, Ristroph penned a lyric essay that used the path of the eclipse as a literary mechanism to explore the United States\u2019 troubled racial history of \u201ctotality\u201d and \u201cdivision.\u201d In noting that the path of the eclipse would cross sections of the United States in which there lived \u201calmost no black people,\u201d Ristroph was clear to state that this circumstance was a coincidence (from an astronomical standpoint) but used that fact as an opportunity to examine the historical reasons why some areas of America remain predominantly non-black. Along the way, she discussed different visions of \u201ctotality,\u201d such as Oregon\u2019s original goal of being an all-white state, and General William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s vision of \u201ctotal war\u201d during the U.S. Civil War. At no point did Ristroph use the word \u201cracist,\u201d and she explicitly made the (blindingly obvious) point that the eclipse itself did not harbor any racial prejudice: It has been dubbed the Great American Eclipse, and along most of its path, there live almost no black people. Presumably, this is not explained by the implicit bias of the solar system. It is a matter of population density, and more specifically geographic variations in population density by race, for which the sun and the moon cannot be held responsible \u2026 The shadow of the moon doesn\u2019t care where it falls or who lives below. In 2015, the Daily Caller similarly prevaricated about a New York Times opinion piece on the subject of low visitation rates at national parks by minorities. Under the headline \u201cNow America\u2019s National Parks Are Racist,\u201d the Daily Caller wrote: The cozily white opinion pages of The New York Times attacked the National Park Service and America\u2019s majestic national parks as racist because way too many white people visit them. Also, the visitors are old. And about 80 percent of the park service\u2019s employees are white. Thus, \u201cminorities are unwelcome.\u201d One again, the Daily Caller completely misrepresented the thrust of a race-related discussion. The New York Times article in question, by Glenn Nelson, did not decry either America\u2019s national parks or the National Park Service as being \u201cracist,\u201d nor did that word appear anywhere in Nelson\u2019s piece. The gist of Nelson\u2019s article was that attendance at U.S. national parks by minorities was comparatively low, that a primary reason for that phenomenon was unfamiliarity with national parks among minorities, and that the National Park Service should try to encourage broader visitation through outreach aimed at clearing up such unfamiliarity. Nelson did not assert, as the Daily Caller misrepresented, that \u201cminorities are unwelcome\u201d at U.S. national parks. In fact, he argued the opposite \u2014 that the National Park Service should attempt to dispel the misperception among minorities that they were not welcome at national parks: [M]any minorities say they know little about the nation\u2019s parks or what to expect when visiting them. In the 2011 park service survey, nonwhites were more than three times as likely as whites to say that the parks provided poor service and were not safe to visit. And those responses were from nonvisitors, which means that perceptions had congealed into reality among what should be an important constituency for the parks. We need to demolish the notion that the national parks and the rest of nature are an exclusive club where minorities are unwelcome. The park service[\u2018s] \u2026 outreach should be tailored to minorities and delivered where they log in, follow, Tweet, view or listen. The park service needs to shout to minorities from its iconic mountaintops, \u201cWe want you here!\u201d On 12 January 2017, President Barack Obama took up that suggestion, issuing a memorandum on \u201cDiversity and Inclusion in Our National Parks\u201d that directed federal agencies (among other actions) to engage in conducting \u201cactive outreach to diverse populations\u201d and \u201cidentifying and making improvements to existing programs to increase visitation and access by diverse populations\u201d \u2014 \u201cparticularly minority, low-income, and disabled populations and tribal communities.\u201d",

        "claim": "Children who watch at least 30 minutes of \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d per day have a 56 percent higher probability of developing autism.",
        "doc": "On 20 October 2016, the website Morning News USA published a story(now with an editor\u2019s note that the claims have been debunked) reportingthat a popular children\u2019s television character named Peppa Pig caused children to develop autism by inspiring them to replicate her irreverent attitude toward authority. This transparent piece of clickbait, which was picked up by a number of other websites and social media accounts, cited a 2012 \u201cUniversity of Harvard\u201d study: Experts claimed that Peppa suffers from superiority complex, shows inappropriate behavior, is impolite, intolerant, disrespectful, envious, arrogant and proud. These are not the traits that children should emulate! They claimed that Peppa Pig is breeding disrespectful behavior among children. Besides, researchers from the University of Harvard published the result of an experiment that they conducted in 2012. It said that watching Peppa Pig was one of the main causes of autism among children. Marc Wildemberg, an epidemiologist who was the lead researcher said: \u201cchildren exposed to at least 30 minutes a day of the show have a 56% higher probability of developing autism.\u201d Outside of the clear misrepresentations of both autism and science, there are a number of equally obvious hints that this \u201cresearch\u201d is entirely fabricated. First of all, the \u201cUniversity of Harvard\u201d is not a real place (Harvard University is, though). Second, Harvard University has not mentioned the study on any of their webpages and a brief search of Google Scholar reveals that this is because the study itself does not exist. Third, Marc Wildemberg, who probably doesn\u2019t exist either, has never been associated with Harvard and has no web presence to speak of. The connection between autism and television was controversially suggested by an economist based solely on correlations between rain, cable televisionsubscriptions, and autism rates in three states. The study, published as a non-peer reviewed National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, has since been widely criticized: [Lead author] Prof. Waldman\u2019s findings do nothing to explain the mechanism by which television would influence autism, a gap that instrumental variables are inherently unable to fill. That\u2019s one reason many autism researchers think he shouldn\u2019t have publicized his results or made recommendations to parents. \u201cI think this is irresponsible,\u201d says [autism specialist] Dr. Klin of Yale. \u201cWe should not provide clinical advice unless there is scientific evidence to substantiate it.\u201d Further, the assertion that autism is a learned behavior is not rooted any science. While the cause is unknown, many scientists believe it is the result of a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Finally, to characterize autism as simply \u201crude\u201d behavior offensively suggests that the behavior of an autistic person is necessarily bothersome, and intentionally at that. In reality, autism is composed of a broad spectrum of conditions related to an individual\u2019s ability to interact and behave socially. As defined by the CDC: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. There is often nothing about how people with ASD look that sets them apart from other people, but people with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. The learning, thinking, and problem-solving abilities of people with ASD can range from gifted to severely challenged. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others need less. This blatant piece of viral pseudoscience fear-mongering, however, is not the kind of help people with ASD or their parents and caregivers need. Morning News USA has since cast their own (muted) doubt on the story, updating their post with the caveat that University of Harvard epidemiologist Marc Wildemberg \u201cdoes not seem [to be] a credible person to claim that watching Peppa Pig can lead to autism\u201d.",

        "doc": "As the government shutdown continues its stretch as the longest in U.S. history, claims on who is and isn\u2019t affected, and everything in between, have been called into question. If you still have some lingering questions, we tackled many of them here and here. But now, a viral Facebook post is alleging that millions of undocumented immigrants have received checks from the government while federal workers remain unpaid. One post claiming this, shared on Jan. 20, has been shared more than 4,100 times. An identical one, posted a day later, has racked up more than 3,200 shares. The full post reads: \"18 million illegal immigrants got their government checks this month\u2026 Federal works...let that sink in.\" It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to some of the people who shared this meme on their pages for evidence. One user responded in the comments of the post, pointing to a 1997 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The other, a Facebook account called \"Washington State for Donald Trump 2020,\" told us it came from comments made by U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on a Fox News segment. Jordan\u2019s spokesperson, Ian Fury, said he was not familiar with the claim, and when we searched Fox News content, we did not find evidence that the congressman said the phrase. The 1997 report only covers what types of benefits undocumented immigrants can receive, which are food programs or Medicaid through their U.S.-born children, and how much that had cost 20 years ago. While it does discuss that some of these families may misrepresent their income to receive more, it isn\u2019t relevant to the claim that \"18 million\" just received a government check. In our research we found that, no, 18 million illegal immigrants did not receive a check from the government amid the shut down. Here\u2019s how we know. First, a November 2018 study by the Pew Research Center puts the total number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. far lower than 18 million. As of 2016, the most recent data available, the report found the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country decreased to 10.7 million from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. In a fact sheet published the same month by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, they estimated the figure is closer to 11.3 million. Taking either figure into account, it would be impossible for 18 million undocumented immigrants to receive checks from the government, because there are only approximately 11 million living in the country. We spoke with Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. \"Obviously, unauthorized immigrants themselves are hardly eligible for any government assistance that it\u2019s hard to know what they would be getting checks for,\" Capps said. \"Their children who are born in the U.S. may be eligible for emergency Medicaid, but that is not the majority.... And as far as food stamps go, most illegal immigrants are ineligible for that. If they are receiving them, it\u2019s only a fraction of the population and it isn\u2019t for themselves it\u2019s for their children, and again that\u2019s not a check.\" The mathematical misstep may have stemmed from lumping the number of legal immigrants into the equation. According to a December 2018 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, 63 percent of non-citizen households use welfare programs. But the same report states, citing census data, that only about half of non-citizen households are made up of undocumented immigrants. The rest of the folks in this group include long-term temporary visitors such as guest workers and foreign students as well as permanent residents who have not be naturalized but hold green cards Then, there are also legal restrictions that limit immigrants from receiving most federal benefits. Undocumented immigrant households primarily benefit from government food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children. Undocumetedimmigrants are ineligible to receive the following federal benefits: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program), non-emergency Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and its precursor, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), according to the National Immigration Law Center. Another report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low levels of immigration, estimated that in 2012, of the number of households headed by immigrants who are in the country illegally, 4 percent used housing programs. \"While households headed by illegal immigrants make some use of housing and cash programs, their use is lower than that of households headed by the native-born for these programs,\" the study said. Viral Facebook posts are claiming that 18 million illegal immigrants received a government check this month, while federal workers remain unpaid amid the government shutdown. We could not find any evidence that supports this figure, and multiple reports put the total number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. far lower than 18 million. Moreover, illegal immigrants are barred from receiving most federal benefits, and primarily will benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s been around for at least a couple of years; Snopes checked this same claim and image in 2018. We looked at training and gun-related deaths and found that while the numbers for the Nordic countries are largely accurate, the numbers fall apart when we get to the U.S. statistics. And while the overall claim that the U.S. has less police training and more civilian deaths at the hands of police is accurate, this idea falls short in that it presumes a direct link between police training and fatal civilian encounters and does not take into consideration additional factors like each country\u2019s gun culture. The U.S. has more gun violence than any other large, wealthy country and ranks the 28th-highest rate of gun violence in the world, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The U.S. also has the highest concentration of guns owned by civilians, with 120.5 guns for every 100 residents. The second highest rate of gun ownership is in Yemen with 52.8 guns for every 100 residents. Iceland and Finland are in the top ten gun-owning countries, with a little over 30 guns for every 100 residents. Finland has the 11th highest rate of intentional homicides in Europe, which is considered average compared to other European countries but high for a Nordic country. However, in 2017, the U.S. homicide rate was four times the homicide rate in Finland. And, as of 2015,the U.S. gun-related homicide rate was more than four timesFinland's.Iceland hasn\u2019t had a gun-related civilian murder since 2007. And while Norway is known for having a high gun-owning rate, it has a low rate of gun violence compared to the rest of Europe. In a Washington Post article on police shootings, leading criminologist Geoffrey Alpert described how researchers struggle to pinpoint why the U.S. has had so many fatal police shootings. \"We\u2019ve looked at this data in so many ways, including whether race, geography, violent crime, gun ownership or police training can explain it,\" he said. \"But none of those factors alone can explain how consistent this number appears to be.\" George Washington Law Professor Cynthia Lee in the 2018 University of Illinois Law Review wrote that \"only a multiplicity of reforms\" will reduce fatal police shootings and lead to \"lasting structural changes in policing.\" The claim that Norway requires three years of training and has had four people killed since 2002 is accurate. According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which calls itself the world\u2019s largest regional security organization, basic police training in Norway includes a three-year college education at the Norwegian Police University College. Trainees study at the college in their first and third years and spend their second year in on-the-ground training. The Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs releases annual reports on police encounters they have investigated and articles on policing trends. In 2014, the report included an article on police shootings. In all 15 police shootings the bureau had investigated \"16 persons have been injured\u2026 and, in two of these cases, the injuries resulted in death.\" A European news network called The Local reported in 2016 that there had been a fatal police shooting in 2015 and another in 2016 that marked \"the fourth time that police in Norway have been involved in a fatal shooting since 2002.\" The Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs\u2019 most recent report was from 2018 and it doesn\u2019t list any fatal shootings. Searching recent news, we couldn\u2019t find another story on fatal police shootings in Norway from 2019 or 2020. The claim that Finland requires two years of training and has seven people killed since 2000 is a bit off. The country\u2019s police training program takes more than two years, and there is a little more information to be considered when calculating the number of deaths. Like Norway, Finland\u2019s Police University College has a policing bachelors program. It requires students to complete 180 credit points, which usually takes three years to complete, not two like the post claims. Snopes reviewed and shared a list of 2000-18 police-related fatalities from the Finland National Police Board. Contacted by PolitIFact, Liisa Haapanen, the board\u2019s senior communication adviser, verified the accuracy of the list and said that the numbers have not changed. The list details nine police-related fatalities, including a 2012 case in which a person died after an officer deployed a Taser; the report says it is unclear how electric shocks contributed to his death. The report also includes a 2010 incident in which a security guard was fatally shot after a police officer \"accidentally discharged\" their weapon. The post\u2019s claim that Iceland requires two years of training and that one person has been killed is right. Iceland has very little violent crime. Iceland\u2019s police university, the University of Akureyri, offers a bachelor's degree for police and law enforcement that has a two-year schedule. In 2013, Iceland\u2019s first-ever fatal police shooting generated a lot of media coverage. The police department apologized to the victim\u2019s family. The Reykjav\u00edk Police chief said the event would be thoroughly investigated and the police officers involved received grief counseling. \u00c1sgeir Sverrisson, The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, verified with PolitiFact that the 2013 shooting was the only fatal police shooting in Iceland\u2019s history but that there have been instances in which citizens died in police custody or following police confrontations. This Facebook\u2019s most misleading claims come when it summarizes police training and officer-involved fatalities in the U.S. It says the U.S. requires 21 weeks of training and has experienced \"8,000+ people killed since 2001.\" The best data suggest a number far higher than 8,000. Where the post has a point is that initial U.S. police training requirements are shorter than in these Nordic countries. U.S. police academies vary. A 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics review found that from 2011 to 2013, most academy training lasts \"an average of about 840 hours, or 21 weeks.\" Nearly all police officers completed a mandatory field training after their basic training according to that 2013 report. About 37% of field training programs are organized by academies that require an average of 500 additional hours, or over 12 weeks, to complete field training. Based on these numbers, police officers have an average of 33 weeks of training. Based on that 2016 report, U.S. police officers are trained for almost eight months, and about three months of that training is in the field. The bigger problem in analyzing the post is that there are only estimates for the number of people killed by police. The Bureau of Justice Statistics recorded arrest-related deaths from 2003-09. During that seven-year period, there were 4,813 reported deaths from \"law enforcement personnel attempting to arrest or restrain\" citizens. About 60% of those deaths, 2,931 of them, were ruled a homicide. There is no data in the report that indicates how many of these were gun-related. Though the FBI in 2019 launched the National Use-of-Force Data Collection effort, law enforcement agencies are not required to participate and the FBI has not yet released any findings. The Washington Post in 2015 started recording fatal shooting victims and found that police have shot and killed about 5,400 people in the five years since \u2014 roughly 1,000 people a year. Fatal Encounters, a database created by a journalist, tracks deaths of people killed by law enforcement with crowd-sourced information and paid researchers, using public records and news reports. The database lists over 28,000 people who have been killed while interacting with law enforcement since 2000. About 20,300 were the result of firearms. A Facebook post compared the number of fatal gun-related police encounters and the length of police training in three Nordic countries and the U.S. \"Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+ people killed since 2001.\" The numbers in this claim were partly accurate. Finland\u2019s police training takes longer than two years, and it had two more police-related deaths. The claims about U.S. policing were the most inaccurate. Police academies and departments usually require more than 21 weeks of training and estimates for fatal police shootings point to about 20,000 deaths in the past 20 years. What\u2019s missing most from the post, however, is context. The rate of gun violence and gun ownership is higher in the U.S. than in these other countries. Research has also shown that fatal police shootings are the result of a combination of factors and are not limited to time spent in police training alone. Experts say there needs to be structural U.S. policing reform, not just more time spent intraining. We rate this claim Half True. Correction, June 22, 2020:Finland has a high homicide rate compared to mostNordic countries, but it does not have the highest homicide rate in Europe. Homicides in the U.S. are four times as high as in Finland's, according to 2017 data. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on these two points.",

        "doc": "Did an 11-year-old girl shoot and kill two \"illegal aliens\" during a home invasion in Montana? No. This faux tale is more than 12years old and continues to resurface on social media even though it\u2019s been debunked several times over the years. The rumor showed up on Facebook again on Sept. 20 on the page \"Adorable Deplorables for Trump\" and has gotten over 500 comments and more than 1,500 shares. The post shared an image of a young girl holding a shotgun with text below it that recounts the story: \"11-YEAR-OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS. Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things: 1. They were in Montana. 2. Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine...\" The post goes on to say that the girl grabbed a shotgun and killed both men before police were able to arrive and that one of the immigrants had already killed another man during an earlier home invasion. At the end it asks if you ever wonder why \"good stuff\" never makes the news. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, a reverse-image search revealed the girl in the photo is actually a 14-year-old from New Jersey who was featured in a piece by the New Yorker about kids who use recreational firearms. And the story about the girl shooting intruders \"never made the news\" because it never actually happened. The account can only be found in other websites that repeat the same information, with no additional details. A search of the Nexis database surfaced a few stories where young people helped thwart home invasions by using firearms over the years, but none lined up with the post. We did find a 1988 story of an 11-year-old shooting and killing two burglars \u2013 but the child was a boy and the incident took place in Switzer, South Carolina. As well, the men were not named \"Ralphel Resindez\" and \"Enrico Garza,\" but were two ex-convicts named Danny Ray Abernathy and Broadus Petty. Some earlier versions of the rumor named the Montana town of Butte as being the location of the incident, but a 2007 story by the Montana Standard newspaper, which included an interview with the town\u2019s sheriff, called the shooting \"nothing but an urban myth:\" \"When asked about the authenticity of the events described in this story, Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh told The Montana Standard in an earlier interview that his office never investigated such an incident. \u2018This never happened,\u2019 Walsh said. The story claims the girl shot and killed the two intruders while she was home alone. The story doesn\u2019t provide a street address or attribute the information to any official sources. Walsh brushed off the story of an urban myth. \u2018It\u2019s amazing how these things get around,\u2019 he said.\" Phillip Morris, a columnist with The Plain Dealer, wrote a piece about the myth in 2013: \"There was no Ralphel Resindez, there was no Enrico Garza, and despite her elevation to heroine status with some gun rights groups, there was no little girl named Patricia who bravely defended her home with her father's shotgun. So why does this story still circulate? \"Probably, because it seems perfectly believable. For a nation that remains bitterly divided on the issues of immigration and gun control, this violent parable highlights the worst fears of what illegal immigration and stricter gun control could portend for the nation.\" We rate this old urban legend Pants on Fire!",

        "claim": "There are \"850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry.\"",
        "doc": "How do you know if a Democratic candidate is talking about the auto industry bailout in Ohio?His lips are moving.But, seriously, few issues excite party operatives more these days than the resurgence of Chrysler and General Motors, both rescued by the federal government. Democrats see it as a huge positive for President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who just so happen to be up for re-election this year, and a huge negative for their Republican challengers.And while this might make for smart politics, particularly in states such as Michigan and Ohio, sometimes the crisp talking points come at the expense of facts. With this in mind, PolitiFact Ohio chose to look at a number that the Ohio Democratic Party has seized on with gusto.The party trotted the number out in a March 13, 2012, news release targeting Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, Brown\u2019s Republican opponent in the Senate contest. The news release trumpeted criticism from Toledo-area auto workers toward Mandel, saying he would have opposed auto industry bailouts.There are \"850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry,\" the release said.That number has become key to ODP\u2019s core argument. The party used it in two other recent releases. One on March 6, the day of the Super Tuesday primary, took aim at front-running Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, an outspoken opponent of bailouts. The other on March 12 targeted Mandel.We\u2019re not addressing Mandel\u2019s position on the auto bailouts or how Romney\u2019s anti-bailout view will serve him if he faces off against Obama in November. That\u2019s a political calculation for another forum.ODP Chairman Chris Redfern and others have repeatedly claimed that the industry would have died had Romney and Mandel been calling the shots on the bailouts. That, too, is a hypothetical pretty much impossible to prove one way or the other.But what about the number?We asked Andrew Zucker, the ODP\u2019s press secretary, for the source, and he pointed us to the Center for Automotive Research, or CAR. In 2010, the independent group from Ann Arbor, Mich., published a 55-page report examining the U.S. auto industry\u2019s economic worth nationwide.Side note: We started looking into the number\u2019s accuracy after it was used in those two previous releases. By the time we had downloaded the report, Zucker had fired off the latest ODP missive, using the same statistic -- but this time with a full citation. We\u2019re using that statement for this item.An appendix on page 48 of the report provides a state by state breakdown that attributes 848,304 Ohio jobs to the U.S. auto industry. That\u2019s roughly 12 percent of the state\u2019s workforce, according to CAR.PolitiFact Ohio then took a closer look at how CAR arrived at its figures.For starters, it is important to understand what types of jobs factor into the group\u2019s analysis. CAR looks at three levels of employment: direct, intermediate and a category they call spin-off.Direct employees include those who work for automakers, parts manufacturers or car dealers. Intermediate employees work for companies that sell goods or services used by the direct employers. And spin-off jobs are the jobs created by the spending activity of employees in the direct and intermediate categories. Such employees could be a cashier at the supermarket or mall, a waiter or a bartender.In Ohio, about 149,000 jobs are attributed to direct employment, 285,000 to intermediate and 415,000 to spin-off. Half of the jobs are tied to automakers rather than suppliers or dealers.It is clear, though, that intermediate and spin-off jobs account for a majority of the estimated jobs. Those numbers, according to CAR\u2019s report, come from a \"dynamic, inter-industry model\" -- in other words, a simulation that includes multipliers. The methodology is not uncommon.We touched base with Kim Hill, one of the report\u2019s authors, who confirmed what PolitiFact Ohio suspected. These estimates include not only U.S. automakers with Ohio operations, but also foreign automakers such as Honda, which has an Ohio presence.That is a key point because the ODP has typically used the 850,000 number in a context that suggests that\u2019s how many jobs were at stake in the bailout. ODP, in the March 12 news release that also targeted Mandel, went as far as saying \"850,000 Ohio jobs \u2026 would have been in jeopardy\" had a hypothetical Sen. Mandel and his colleagues voted against the bailout.This would be more accurate if those 850,000 jobs were tied solely to Chrysler and GM, the beneficiaries of the bailout. But had these two companies failed, Ohio still would have Honda, as well as suppliers and dealers that also do business with other foreign companies and Ford.Honda employs more than 13,500 Ohioans, according to recent media statements. The company has announced more than $500 million in Ohio investment since late 2010.Hill gave the ODP a pass here and noted that industrywide fallout from the collapse of two giants would have been significant for suppliers and other service providers and thus would have impacted spin-off employment, as well.Hill also noted that those jobs are supported by the auto industry not just in Ohio but in other states, too. A generic example would be a Cleveland metals manufacturer or another Ohio company that provides some professional service (an intermediate employer) to a Detroit automaker (a direct employer). In this case, it is auto industry in Michigan that is supporting the jobs in Ohio.The ODP\u2019s claim was that \"850,000 Ohio jobs (are) tied to the auto industry.\" That is an accurate statement. While the jobs figure includes intermediate and spinoff jobs, as well as direct employment, that manner of counting is not uncommon for evaluating employment impact.On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the statement True.",

AFP has also previously debunked the conspiracy theory that global elites are using the pandemic as a pretext to control the population. The Supreme Court case referred to in the claim \"is not related to the question of determining who/what is human and what is not,\" Ana Santos Rutschman, an expert in vaccine law and assistant professor at St Louis University's Center for Health Law Studies, told AFP. \"There's no relationship between this case and any claim related to the administration of any type of vaccine, including mRNA vaccines,\" nor is there a \"case or law saying that after any type of medical intervention (including receiving a vaccine) someone ceases to be considered a human for legal purposes,\" Rutschman said. Instead, the Supreme Court found in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc that isolated segments of human DNA could not be patented. The unanimous decision on June 13, 2013 overturned exclusive rights to use genes but allowed companies to patent their developments of synthetic, so-called complementary DNA.

Experts have also repeatedly rejected the unsubstantiated claim that mRNA vaccines can modify human DNA, which AFP debunked here and here. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that mRNA vaccines are a new form of immunization designed to \"teach our cells how to make a protein -- or even just a piece of a protein -- that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.\" It adds that the shots cannot \"affect or interact with our DNA in any way.\" Jennifer Piatt, of Arizona State University Center for Public Health Law and Policy, called the social media claim \"ridiculous\" and \"a complete misstatement of how the vaccines work and what that court case said.\" First, \"there is no possibility for an altering of the human DNA via the COVID-19 vaccines like these posts would suggest,\" said Piatt, who is also a senior attorney with the Network for Public Health Law.

Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are vying in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary. The winner will take on Baldwin Nov. 6, 2018. In Baldwin\u2019s ad, released online on July 31, 2018, the narrator asserts: New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people. So, Baldwin is portraying Nicholson as being paid big money to play a role in shutting down plants and laying off people. There is a connection. But there is less here than meets the eye. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Associated Press story To back up the narrator\u2019s statement, this headline from an Associated Press news story is shown on the screen: \"Nicholson consulted for companies that shed jobs.\" The AP said in the story, posted eight days before the launch of the ad, that the story was based on information provided by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge. American Bridge also produced a video that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad. According to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas. Examples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs. To be clear: The article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns. But it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions. The article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017. But the article did not say how much he was paid for the companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns. All of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. What we don\u2019t know An executive for ghSMART, the company that employs Nicholson, told us ghSMART helps companies \"interview, evaluate and develop their senior leadership\" and \"has never advised any clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs.\" And Nicholson\u2019s campaign has reiterated those points, while also going so far in condemning the AP article as to call the reporter a \"liberal hack.\" But Nicholson and his company have also described their work as being more broad, involving more than merely advising about executive leadership. The AP pointed out that, according to the ghSMART website, the firm works with companies and investors on \"management assessment and organizational change initiatives.\" Nicholson himself, the AP noted, has said his job involves helping companies design strategies for growth, assisting with mergers and acquisitions, and problem solving. And Nicholson\u2019s campaign has described his work as \"helping companies solve their toughest problems.\" In short: We simply don\u2019t know what Nicholson may have advised the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns. Our rating Baldwin says: \"New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.\"An Associated Press report said Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states. And it says Nicholson received more than $1 million for his consulting work between January 2016 and November 2017. But it doesn\u2019t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns. In short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies. And we don\u2019t know whether Nicholson\u2019s work had anything to do with the layoffs and the shutdowns. There\u2019s simply no evidence of what he did for those companies. Baldwin\u2019s statement contains only some element of truth \u2014 our definition of Mostly False.",

        "doc": "A post claiming that this year\u2019s February month is unique in a way as all weekdays are repeated four times and that this occurs only once every 823 years is being shared on social media platforms. The calendar of February 2021 is also shared in the post in support of the claim. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. The archived version of this post can be found here Claim: February 2021 is unique as all weekdays are repeated exactly four times in this month. This occurs only once every 823 years. Fact: Except for a leap year, every weekday repeats exactly four times in every non-leap year month of February as it has exactly 28 days. Also, this is not a rare phenomenon which occurs every 823 years. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. Every weekday repeating exactly four times is not a rare phenomenon. The month of February has 28 days in every non-leap year, which implies February of every non-leap year has exactly four weeks (28/7 =4) which further implies every weekday in this month repeats exactly four times. For example, if we look at the years 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, every weekday in the month of February repeated four times in all these years. Whereas in a leap year, the weekday of 01 February repeats five times and rest of the weekdays repeat just four times. However, the claim that this happens once every 823 years, is not true. In every non-leap year all the weekdays in the month of February repeat four times. FACTLY has debunked similar claims related to the uniqueness of months before which can be read here. To sum it up, every weekday repeats four times in every non-leap year month of February, not once every 823 years.",

        "claim": "A 13-year-old boy in Thailand died from pumping air up his rectum to get high.",
        "doc": "Originally making the cyberspace rounds in mid-1997, a fancifully-embellished cautionary tale has been enshrined as one of the Internet\u2019s \u201cDarwin Awards.\u201d Though the story was often identified as an article from the 15 August 1993 Japan Times, we found no evidence that news outlet ever published it: \u201cThe government must crack down on this disgusting craze of Pumping\u201d, a spokesman for the Nakhon Ratchasima hospital told reporters. \u201cIf this perversion catches on, it will destroy the cream of Thailand\u2019s manhood.\u201d He was speaking after the remains of 13-year-old Charnchai Puanmuangpak had been rushed into the hospital\u2019s emergency room. \u201cMost \u2018Pumpers\u2019 use a standard bicycle pump,\u201d he explained, \u201cinserting the nozzle far up their rectum, giving themselves a rush of air, creating a momentary high.This act is a sin against God.\u201d Charnchai took it further still. He started using a two-cylinder foot pump, but even that wasn\u2019t exciting enough for him, and he boasted to friends that he was going to try the compressed air hose at a nearby gasoline station. They dared him to do it so, under cover of darkness, he snuck in. Not realising how powerful the machine was, he inserted the tube deep into his rectum, and placed a coin in the slot. As a result, he died virtually instantly, but passers by are still in shock. One woman thought she was watching a twilight firework display, and started clapping. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t located all of him,\u201d say the police authorities. \u201cWhen that quantity of air interacted with the gas in his system, he nearly exploded.It was like an atom bomb went off or something.\u201d \u201cPumping is the devil\u2019s pastime, and we must all say no to Satan,\u201d Ratchasima concluded. \u201cInflate your tires by all means, but then hide your bicycle pump where it cannot tempt you.\u201d As humorous as this bit of scarelore was, it fell down upon closer examination for multiple reasons: The tone of indignant moral outrage is common to such offerings; it works to highlight the humor of the situation as we find ourselves laughing even as the ubiquitous cartoonish \u201cspokesman\u201d heatedly expounds upon the latest threat to Society. We\u2019re also captured by the obligatory mental picture of the lad\u2019s inglorious yet pyrotechnic end. (\u201cOne woman thought she was watching a twilight firework display, and started clapping.\u201d) As unbelievable as this story is, it appears to be a fanciful embellishment of the 1993 death of Charnchai Puanmuangpak of Thailand. Though the 13-year-old did die from a punctured intestine brought about by compressed air being forced into his rectum, he was killed by others; there was no element of a death brought about by self-gratification gone wrong. The real Charnchai Puanmuangpak died when two of his 15-year-old co-workers at the gas station carried a prank too far. These older lads were in the habit of turning the compressed air upon Charnchai when they found him napping. Finding him deeply asleep, this time they inserted the nozzle into his bum. The boy died before reaching the hospital, and the two lads who inserted the hose were charged with carelessness resulting in death. A similar act of battery carried out upon a 13-year-old boy in Dezhou city (Shandong province), China, on 30 June 2012 left the unfortunate teen barely clinging to life. Two of Du Chuanwang\u2019s co-workers at the gas station where they all worked inserted the nozzle of an air pump hose into the youngster\u2019s anus then blew air through it, in the process damaging Du\u2019s liver, kidneys, and stomach and causing massive bleeding within the abdomen. Following a charity appeal, the boy was moved from a local hospital (Xiajin County People\u2019s Hospital) to the far better equipped Bayi Children\u2019s Hospital in Beijing.",

Running a Reverse Image Search of the video keyframes, we found a YouTube video on the official channel of ETV Andhra Pradesh, dated January 19, 2019, with a title: \u20182019 elections are to dethrone Modi, says Kejriwal\u2019. Many other opposition party leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Akhilesh Yadav, Farooq Abdullah, etc., can be seen on the stage along with Kejriwal. The keyframes starting at 5:41 match with the viral video, but we can\u2019t hear Kejriwal mentioning Pakistan anywhere in his speech, indicating that the viral video is dubbed. The part where he says \u201c\u2026.Agar Modi aur Shah 2019 me aagaye toh Pakistan nahin bachega\u201d in the viral video was overlapped on him saying, \u201c\u2026.Agar Modi aur Shah 2019 me aagaye toh yeh desh nahin bachega\u201d Going through the description of another video about the same rally on the India Today channel, we got to know that the video was from the \u2018opposition mega meet\u2019 organised in Kolkata by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. India TV\u2019s YouTube channel had also uploaded a similar video from the rally as well. Here too, we could not find any mention of Pakistan in Kejriwal\u2019s speech, proving that the viral video has been edited to spread misinformation. Therefore, we can conclusively say that the viral post\u2019s claim over Kejriwal\u2019s speech is doctored.

        "doc": "South Africans go to the polls tomorrow to elect new local governments. The country's three main parties held rallies at the weekend in a final effort to sweep up support. The party leaders made claims that raised eyebrows, however. Readers asked us to look into claims by the leaders of the ANC and the DA, President Jacob Zuma and Mmusi Maimane. We also evaluated a promise by EFF leader Julius Malema that made news headlines. African National Congress (ANC) Claim \"In 1994 we took over as the democratic government just over 50% of households had access to clean piped water and today over 95% of our people enjoy access to clean piped water.\" Verdict incorrect President Jacob Zuma made this claim in one of Johannesburg's stadiums. South Africa's most recent nationally representative survey on service delivery is the 2016 Community Survey, released earlier this month. It shows that 89.1% of households in the country has access to piped water . The rest relies on rivers, streams, boreholes, rainwater tanks or other sources of water. To find the figure for 1994 is trickier. As we've reported before , the earliest data that Statistics South Africa has is the 1995 October Household Survey , which found that 78.5% of households had access to clean water then. However, the agency's manager of service delivery statistics, Ni\u00ebl Roux, told Africa Check at the time that the particular survey was \"hamstrung by a series of methodological and practical issues\" so the data isn't often used today. A smaller nationally representative survey, carried out by the Southern Africa Labour Development Research Unit (SALDRU) in late 1993 and early 1994, found that 76.4% of households had access to piped water . Professor Ingrid Woolard, currently with SALDRU, told Africa Check previously that this survey was \"fairly reliable, but it was a small survey \u2013 less than 9,000 households \u2013 so there will be some margin of error\". The earliest credible data source from Stats SA is considered the 1996 Census , which found that 60,7% of households had access to piped water in their dwelling or yard, with 20,8% using public taps, for a total of 81.5%. READ: Zuma wrong on household electricity: about 50% of homes had access in 1994 Democratic Alliance (DA) Claim \"In Midvaal... unemployment is half of what it is for the rest of Gauteng.\" Verdict incorrect The leader of the DA, Mmusi Maimane, said this at the party's final election rally in Dobsonville on Saturday. When Africa Check fact-checked the DA's national election manifesto, we found they were correct in claiming that Midvaal had the lowest unemployment rate in Gauteng . This applies to both the narrow definition of unemployment (counting people actively looking for work) - at 18.8% - and the expanded one (including people who've given up looking for a job), at 25.5%. The rates are based on Census 2011 data which contains the most recent unemployment data available for municipalities, Monet Durieux from the labour statistics unit at Stats SA told Africa Check. However, with Gauteng's corresponding figures at 26.3% (narrow) and 32.8% (broad), unemployment in Midvaal is not half of what it is in the rest of the province. Municipality Narrow unemployment rate Broad unemployment rate Emfuleni 34.7% 41.9% Westonaria 29.5% 36.0% Ekurhuleni 28.8% 35.2% Merafong City 27.2% 33.9% Randfontein 27.1% 32.8% Lesedi 25.9% 33.6% City of Johannesburg 25% 31.3% Mogale City 24.6% 30.4% City of Tshwane 24.2% 30.7% Midvaal 18.8% 25.5% Gauteng 26.3% 32.8% Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Claim : \"I will increase [pensioners' social grants]. An elderly person will get R3,000 upwards. The child support grants... we will increase it. A child will get R600 upwards.\" Verdict : Not within a municipality's power Speaking at the Peter Mokaba stadium in Polokwane on Sunday, Economic Freedom Fighters' leader Julius Malema said people are spreading lies that the EFF would take away pensioners' social grants . \"I am not taking the older person's grant,\" Malema said. \"I will increase it. An elderly person will get R3,000 upwards. The child support grants... we will increase it. A child will get R600 upwards.\" But can a local municipality actually increase social welfare grant amounts? \"Absolutely not,\" said Dr Andrew Siddle , a researcher focusing on local government based at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Cape Town. He explained that the only way municipalities can assist the poor is with their Indigent Policies . The Municipal Indigent Policy is intended to guide the national initiative to improve the lives of poor people and to improve access to free basic services (water, electricity and sanitation). Media liaison officer Jaconia Kobue of the department of social development , which oversees policy affecting social welfare grants, told Africa Check: \"Grant values are a national government competence and neither local or provincial governments play any significant role in determining these values.\" Currently, the grant for older persons is a maximum of R1,500 while the child support grant is set at R350 . As of 30 September 2015, there were 3.1 million recipients of the old age grant and 11.9 million recipients of the child support grant. In South Africa's 2016 budget, R152.5 billion was set aside for the 7 different social grants. READ: Social grants in South Africa \u2013 separating myth from reality",

        "claim": "Says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact \"we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower.\"",
        "doc": "Gov. Scott Walker has long emphasized falling unemployment rates as evidence that Wisconsin\u2019s sluggish job growth is heading in the right direction. In his January 2013 \"state of the state\" speech, Walker highlighted the decline from 7.8 percent unemployment the month before he took office in January 2011 to the 6.7 percent figure for December 2012. Now, with the recent uptick to 7.1 percent unemployment in the first quarter of 2013, Walker has reworked his message. Asked by host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV\u2019s Upfront show about Democrats criticizing him for focusing on a potential presidential bid instead of the governorship, Walker replied: \"They can\u2019t argue with the success. We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus.\" Let\u2019s take a look at the new talking point on the unemployment rate. Walker says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact that \"we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower.\" Is he right? According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures from monthly household surveys, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate peaked as the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009. That peak -- 9.2 percent -- is the figure Walker selected as a four-year comparison point. And it did fall 2.1 points in that time, so the numbers are accurate. But the statement is complicated by other factors, especially the phrase \"when I decided to run.\" The unemployment rate was surging up in late 2008 and early 2009, so the timing makes a big difference. For instance, Walker officially announced his long-expected candidacy in spring 2009. The most recent unemployment figure at the time was 8.4 percent. But news reports as far back as August 2008 described Walker as \"expected\" to run. The latest unemployment rate at that time was 4.7 percent. When we asked Team Walker for backup, spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said, \"he is not referring to the specific moment he decided to run, but generally to the climate during the time he decided to run four years ago.\" Doyle and Walker Then there\u2019s the issue of who gets credit for the drop from 2009 to 2013; Walker couched the two-point decline as part of \"the success\" he can point to as governor. Here\u2019s the timeline: -- From its 9.2 percent peak in June-July 2009, the rate fell almost monthly during the late stages of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle\u2019s second term, dropping 1.4 points to the 7.8 percent mark in December 2010 when Doyle left office. So exactly two-thirds of the drop Walker mentions happened on his predecessor\u2019s watch. -- After Walker took office in January 2011, the rate ticked down but was essentially flat for nine months before falling slowly to 6.7. Then it reversed course early in 2013, taking some of the luster off the positive trend. That left the total drop during Walker\u2019s time at 0.7 points. So one-third of the drop compared to four years ago came during Walker\u2019s administration. We asked Webster about this, and she responded in an email: \"The Governor was providing a frame of reference for where we were and where we are now.\" A bit of perspective, before we wrap up. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than the national figure (7.1 vs. 7.6 percent). Among seven Midwest states, Wisconsin trails far behind Iowa (4.7) and Minnesota (5.3), but is well ahead of Illinois (9.3), Indiana (8.5) and Michigan (8.4). Wisconsin is fourth of the seven states in improvement in the unemployment rate since the month Walker took office in 2011. Our rating Walker said the success of his agenda is supported by the fact that \"we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower.\" Walker\u2019s numbers are on target if you go back \"four years.\" But he muddies the waters by describing that as when he \"decided to run\" -- and that skews the picture when it comes to improvement. His decision came at an earlier date, when the unemployment rate was either much lower (at the time of his official announcement) or even lower than that (when he was unofficially running). Finally, the construction of the claim is misleading in part on the issue of who gets credit for the improvement. He discloses that he\u2019s going back in time before he was governor but omits Doyle\u2019s record and claims the \"success\" as his, glossing over the fact that only one-third of the gains took place on his watch. There\u2019s an element of truth here, but critical facts are left out. That\u2019s why we\u2019re rating his statement Mostly False.",

        "claim": "Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people have over 99% chance of surviving COVID-19",
        "doc": "CLAIM Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people have over 99% chance of surviving COVID-19 more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Tomi Lahren, Facebook, Twitter, 18 Jul. 2021 DETAILS Misleading: Unvaccinated individuals are more likely to become infected and die of COVID-19 than those who are fully vaccinated. Because COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death, the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. now occur in unvaccinated people. Lack of context: The post ignored the benefits offered by COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of not only severe disease and death, but also persistent health problems in COVID-19 survivors. KEY TAKE AWAY The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are highly effective against severe COVID-19 and death. In contrast, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get infected and sick, and now account for most COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.S. Most of these deaths could be prevented by vaccination. FULL CLAIM: \u201cUnvaccinated, you can get COVID-19 and have over 99% chance of survival. Get vaccinated and you can still get COVID-19 and will still have over 99% of survival\u201d REVIEW On 18 July 2021, political commentator Tomi Lahren published this tweet claiming that vaccinated people can \u201cget COVID-19 and have over 99% chance of survival\u201d, just like unvaccinated people, suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines aren\u2019t useful. She later shared the post on Facebook, receiving more than 122,000 interactions on the platform in one day, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Claims that COVID-19 vaccines aren\u2019t useful because they don\u2019t prevent 100% of infections or because the disease has a high survival rate aren\u2019t new (see examples here, here, here, and here). In her post, Lahren further suggested that people have the same chance of surviving COVID-19 regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not. These claims are inaccurate and misleading in several ways, as we will discuss below. Unvaccinated people are more likely to become infected, develop severe COVID-19, and die It is false that unvaccinated individuals have the same chance of surviving COVID-19 as vaccinated people. Unvaccinated people are much more likely to become infected and get sick. In fact, unvaccinated people account for virtually all recent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. This was the clear message of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rochelle Walensky, in a 16 July 2021 White House briefing: \u201cThis is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk. And communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well.\u201d Besides the personal risk of infection, lower vaccination rates facilitate the transmission of the virus within the population, increasing the risk of outbreaks. Indeed, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are primarily rising in those U.S. states with lower vaccination rates, such as Mississippi or Alabama. These two states, which have fully vaccinated 33% of their population, reported 18 and 20 COVID-19 deaths respectively and almost 9,500 cases together during the last seven days. Based on the 1 April 2020 U.S. population census, these numbers represent a rate of 6 and 4 deaths per million population respectively, and 119 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in both states together. In contrast, the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut that have fully vaccinated more than 62% of their populations reported 12 and 3 deaths respectively and only 2,900 cases together during the same time. These figures represent a rate of 1,7 and 0.83 deaths per million population respectively, and 27 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In Alabama, 96.2% (509) of the 529 COVID-19 deaths from the past three months occurred among unvaccinated people, and only 3.8% (20) were in fully vaccinated people. Lahren\u2019s post implied that vaccines are useless because a small proportion of vaccinated people can still get infected. This misleading argument is also known as the nirvana fallacy. Lahren dismissed a solution because it is imperfect, even though a perfect solution is impossible. No vaccine is 100% effective, and COVID-19 vaccines aren\u2019t an exception. However, this doesn\u2019t mean we should reject them, just as we wouldn\u2019t reject a parachute before jumping from an airplane just because they don\u2019t open in 100% of the cases. Although not perfect, the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are highly effective against severe disease. Real-world studies in Israel, the U.K., and the U.S. showed that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are over 96% effective in preventing hospitalization and death, and about 90% effective against infection in real-life conditions[1,2]. Furthermore, COVID-19 infections in fully vaccinated individuals are rare and tend to produce milder symptoms than in unvaccinated individuals[2,3]. Not everyone has the same likelihood of surviving COVID-19; age, pregnancy, and certain underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes, or obesity increase the risk of death Lahren claimed that COVID-19 has a survival rate of over 99%. This claim is misleading because the likelihood of dying of COVID-19 varies greatly between individuals, depending on factors such as age or underlying health conditions, as Health Feedback explained in this review. This table from the CDC shows how the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death increases with age. Adults aged between 30 and 39 years old are already four times more likely to die than people aged 18 to 29 years old. The likelihood of dying increases up to 600 times for those aged 85 and older. Although children and young adults are less likely to die of COVID-19 compared to older age groups, there is no group that experiences the absence of risk. In the U.S., provisional death counts from the CDC as of 14 July 2021 show that people aged 0 to 17 years old accounted for 335 COVID-19 deaths, while 2,446 deaths occurred among people between 18 to 29 years old. In addition, certain medical conditions, such as heart and respiratory conditions, weakened immune system, cancer, diabetes, or obesity can increase a person\u2019s likelihood of dying from COVID-19, regardless of their age. Pregnant people are also more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people. The proportion of infected people who end up dying of COVID-19 is difficult to estimate and can vary depending on the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex, and percentage of people with underlying health conditions. Even within the same population, this proportion can change over time depending on the circumstances at that specific point in time. While the development of vaccines and effective treatments can help decrease mortality, an overloaded healthcare system due to a surge in the number of infections might lead to higher death rates. Small differences between the survival rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people might seem negligible but they still account for a high number of deaths. For instance, a difference of just 0.1% in the likelihood of death means that one more person will die for every 1,000 who become infected. Only in the past week, the U.S. reported more than 200,000 new COVID-19 cases. In this case, an increase of 0.1% in COVID-19 mortality would represent 200 more deaths in just one week. The danger of COVID-19 is not only limited to death; some COVID-19 survivors experience persistent health problems months after recovery In her post, Lahren presented COVID-19 outcomes as a dichotomy between death and survival. However, the evidence shows that such a reductive view is inaccurate and misleading. Lahren\u2019s post ignored the fact that many COVID-19 survivors continue to suffer from health problems even months after recovery. In some cases, these problems are a consequence of long hospitalization stays after severe illness. However, about one-third of people who recover from COVID-19 show persistent health problems even after mild disease[4,5]. This condition is known as long COVID. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, fatigue, cognitive problems, or joint and muscle pain. These symptoms can last at least for one year after recovering from infection[4,6]. Growing evidence indicates that long COVID causes considerable loss in quality of life and is a serious health concern. An international survey published in July 2021 in the scientific journal The Lancet found that 22% of the 3,762 recovered COVID-19 patients involved in the study reported to be unable to work seven months later, and 45% of them required a reduced work schedule[7]. In this context, COVID-19 vaccines are an essential tool that can help prevent infections and thereby minimize people\u2019s risk of developing long COVID. Many governments are anticipating the potential impact of this disabling condition by developing rehabilitation programs and promoting research on the subject. For example, the U.S. National Institutes for Health (NIH) announced in March 2021 that it would invest 1 billion dollars in investigating this condition. In the U.K., the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) will fund 15 new studies with more than 27 million dollars to understand the causes and find potential treatments for long COVID. Conclusion Lahren\u2019s claim suggested that unvaccinated individuals have similar chances of surviving COVID-19 as those who are fully vaccinated, which makes vaccines seem useless. This is inaccurate and misleading. Unvaccinated people are much more likely to become infected and get severe disease or die. Furthermore, low vaccination rates favor the spread of the virus, posing a health risk for all the individuals within the community, including those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death and also reduce the risk of infection. They reduce the spread of the virus within the population and prevent further health problems associated with COVID-19 infections, such as long COVID. REFERENCES",

        "doc": "On the night of March 25, 2021 videos and photographs of a series of fireball lights in the Pacific Northwest night sky gained traction on social media. Some users commenting on the footage claimed the images showed an \u201cUnidentified Flying Object\u201d (UFO), \u201caliens\u201d or a \u201cmeteorite\u201d. Experts said the lightshow was caused by the reentry of the second stage of a Falcon 9, a SpaceX rocket launched on March 4. A video of the event as seen in Portland, Oregon, was captured by KATU News reporter Genevieve Reaume,here. Local outlet King5 published a compilation of footage of the lights seen from the state of Washington,here \u201cSo. this UFO was just seen over Washington and Oregon. WELCOME our new ALIEN OVERLORDS!\u201d, the title of a Facebook post with a TikTok clip reads (here). Other posts (hereandhere), claim their footage showed a meteor or meteorite. On March 26 at 00:18 ET, Jonathan McDowell, astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian (here) identified the object on Twitter (here) as the second stage of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched on March 4, which \u201cfailed to make a deorbit burn and is now reentering after 22 days in orbit.\u201d The National Weather Service in Seattle also said on Twitter in the early morning of March 26 (here) that according to \u201cunofficial information\u201d, the objects in the sky were debris from the SpaceX rocket. In subsequent tweets, the office explained why the objects were not meteors, based on their reentering angle and slower speed (here). The Falcon 9 is a \u201creusable, two stage rocket\u201d (here). A diagram of the separation of the two stages can be seen in an article by USA Today,here. McDowell said the seven-meter-long stage was \u201csupposed to immolate itself over the ocean south of Australia\u201d (here). Contacted by Reuters via email, McDowell explained the orbit of the rocket, which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida (here), was tracked by the US Space Force as \u201cobject 47782\u201d and that its reentry was \u201cpredicted, although the exact time was not known in advance.\u201d \u201cA reentering rocket melts, disintegrates into many lumps which carry on parallel tracks just as observed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt that what people saw was the breakup and reentry of space debris object 47782.\u201d James Davenport, Research Assistant Professor at the Astronomy Department of the University of Washington, also attributed the event to the SpaceX rocketyoutu.be/ekJanB4cjUk?t=45, in an interview with local outlet KING 5 News (NBC Seattle). \u201cIt did exactly what it was supposed to do, it put satellites in orbit. The only failure it had is that it didn\u2019t complete deorbit burn, so it didn\u2019t come down when and where we expected it,\u201d he added. Similar images were seen in Australia in Feb. 2021 when debris from a Chinese rocket burned up as it re-entered the earth\u2019s atmosphere (here), and in May 2020 with the reentry of a Russian rocket late stage (here). \u201cRemember there is a lot of energy in a space rocket launch,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cThat energy was imparted to the stage at launch and now you are getting it all back in a brief time.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.",

        "claim": "\"In 2012, 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police. ... Same year, 326 whites were killed by police.\"",
        "doc": "Bill O\u2019Reilly made headlines this week by offering his take on a silent Ferguson protest by a few members of the NFL\u2019s St. Louis Rams, saying the decision of the players \"connotes the fact that they believe, I guess, that white police officers shoot black youths all the time.\" That\u2019s out of bounds of a fact-check. But O\u2019Reilly did present some statistics in the same argument that several readers asked us to examine. \"Let's take a good look at this plague of white cops acting violently against blacks, as (professor and liberal columnist Michael Eric) Dyson puts it,\" O\u2019Reilly said on his Dec. 1, 2014, Fox News program. \"In the past 50 years, the rate of black Americans killed by police has dropped 70 percent. In 2012, 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police. There are currently more than 43 million blacks living in the U.S.A. Same year, 326 whites were killed by police bullets. Those are the latest stats available.\" Later in the show, O\u2019Reilly said of these numbers, \"That's not an epidemic. It's not crazy. It's not a hunting-down of black youth.\" This is not the first time we have evaluated pundits\u2019 half-truths comparing black and white deaths from police killings. Like the other cases, O\u2019Reilly is citing available government statistics, but these numbers are shaky and don\u2019t paint a complete picture. Lack of national data O\u2019Reilly\u2019s team used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s fatal injury reports database. A search in the system for fatal \"legal interventions\" -- deaths caused in the course of law enforcement trying to make an arrest or quell a situation -- confirms, on the surface, the numbers O\u2019Reilly mentioned for whites and African-Americans. How does the CDC get the number? Primarily from causes of death listed in death certificates from coroners, medical examiners and physicians and demographic information provided by funeral directors. Figures are further supplemented by a violent death reporting system that includes data from 17 states. (Legal interventions include state executions.) But experts told us the data is likely incomplete because coroners and physicians are under no obligation to detail police involvement in the deaths that they encounter. \"It is not known or certain that every death certificate indicates that the death was caused by law enforcement officer in every jurisdiction,\" said Samuel Walker, retired professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. Another database, this one maintained by the FBI, attempts to get at the same figure. But it\u2019s no more solid. The FBI reports rely on self-reported data from a small chunk of the nation\u2019s more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies. The lack of a national clearinghouse for fatal police killings \"is a national embarrassment,\" said Geoffrey Alpert, a University of South Carolina criminology professor who specializes in high-risk police activities. \"I\u2019m sure one of (O\u2019Reilly\u2019s) researchers pulled a number from that database, but it\u2019s just a convenient fact, as someone used to say,\" he said. More problems with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s numbers Beyond the lack of clear national data for these deaths, experts found more problems with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s citation of CDC numbers. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s reference of the number of whites killed in legal interventions does not strictly account for non-Hispanic whites. People who identify as Hispanic are also counted in the total of 326 deaths. Running the search again for whites but excluding Hispanics leaves 227 deaths from legal interventions -- substantially fewer deaths due to the absence of 97 white Hispanics previously in the mix (in the black category, two were identified as black Hispanic). \"So if you are interested in people of color, what they list in the white data is too high,\" Walker said of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s figures. Additionally, the per capita rate of black deaths per 100,000 residents is .28, which is twice as high as the rate for white deaths of .13, Walker points out. Our ruling O\u2019Reilly said, 123 African-Americans and 326 white people were shot dead by police in 2012. He referenced recent federal numbers but failed to mention their well-documented flaws. We have not found any experts who will vouch for numbers that purport to represent annual fatal shootings by police, as there are gaping holes within each dataset. Additionally, the number of white people fatally shot by police in 2012 is substantially off if you account for white Hispanics -- a group O\u2019Reilly did not seem to have in mind during his rant about race relations between blacks and whites. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but it\u2019s not the full picture he makes it out to be. We rate the claim Mostly False.",

        "claim": "The Build Back Better Act of 2021 included proposals to introduce a \"methane tax\" that would equate to $2,600 per head of cattle and $500 per head of swine.",
        "doc": "In October and November 2021, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of social media posts that claimed that the Build Back Better Act, a major budget and infrastructure bill, contained a \u201cmethane tax\u201d of around $2,600 per head of cattle, and around $500 per swine, per year. For example, one widely-shared Facebook post claimed: \u201cWere you aware the $3.5 Trillion Human Infrastructure package includes an animal agriculture tax of $2,600!! per head of cattle? $500 for swine!!!\u2026\u201d The post contained a photograph of a column written by U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma. In the column, which was also posted to his website on Sep. 22, Mullin claimed that: In an attempt to eliminate fossil fuels, this legislation [the Build Back Better Act] would impose a \u201cfee\u201d on all methane emissions, including in our agriculture industry. We all know that a fee is just a tax and that consumers are the ones who will pay for it. The tax is estimated to cost $6,500 per dairy cow, $2,600 per head of cattle, and $500 per swine each year. That is more than what the animals are worth, it\u2019ll run ranchers out of business. Mullin\u2019s description of the provisions of the bill was inaccurate, as were the numerous social media posts based on it. At the time those claims were made, and as of Nov. 2, 2021, the Build Back Better Act did not contain a tax or fee on methane that would equate to thousands of dollars per head of cattle, or hundreds of dollars per head of swine. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cFalse.\u201d H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, is a 2,468-page budget and infrastructure bill, and has been the subject of intensive negotiations during the fall of 2021. Section 30114 of the legislation provides for a \u201cmethane fee,\u201d but it applies only to \u201cpetroleum and natural gas systems,\u201d and not the agriculture sector. Therefore, Mullin\u2019s claim \u2014 that \u201cthis legislation would impose a \u2018fee\u2019 on all methane emissions, including in our agriculture industry\u201d \u2014 is false. A spokesperson for Mullin told Politifact that the congressman was referring to an amendment to the bill, proposed by Republicans in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which would have explicitly stipulated that the methane fee does not apply to agriculture. Democrats voted down that proposal, on the basis that the text of the legislation already explicitly stipulated that the fee related only to oil and gas production. While expressing concern about hypothetical future actions on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the spokesperson effectively acknowledged that the Build Back Better Act does not currently do what Mullin claimed it did: \u201cWhile the language specifies the oil and gas industry, it also references EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas inventory and leaves too much room for the EPA to expand its regulatory reach.\u201d The same spokesperson also told Politifact that the key figures from Mullin\u2019s op-ed \u2014 \u201c$6,500 per dairy cow, $2,600 per head of cattle, and $500 per swine\u201d \u2014 came from an analysis prepared by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF). However, the AFBF later issued its own news release, clarifying that the analysis was conducted in order to address an entirely hypothetical question, namely what the effect of a methane tax would be if it were applied to the agriculture industry \u2014 a proposal that no participants in Congressional negotiations have so far made. In that Sept. 30 news release, AFBF Vice President Sam Kieffer said: Over the summer, American Farm Bureau economists conducted an analysis, at the request of Congressional committee staff, to determine thepotentialimpact if agriculture were to be included in legislation imposing such a tax. We did so based on the formula set forth in legislative proposals that impose a methane tax on the oil and gas sectors. \u2026While we oppose any tax on methane, Farm Bureau is grateful to lawmakers for recognizing the thin margins in agriculture and that such a tax would undoubtedly put family farms out of business. We are especially grateful to the Senate for passing an amendment that specifically exempts agriculture. That Senate amendment was one proposed by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and passed by a vote of 66-33 on Aug. 10. It prohibited \u201cthe imposition of new Federal methane requirements on livestock.\u201d",

It opened: Bernie Sanders said at the debate last night that he wants minimum wage to be $15 per hour. 15$ X 40 hr week = $600 600$ X 52 weeks per yr = $31,200 Bernie Sanders wants free health care for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was raise taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 per year. 52% of $31,200 = $16,224 in tax $31,200 - $16,224 = $14,976 is your pay $14,967 \u00f7 52 weeks = $288 per week $288 \u00f7 40 hr week = $7.20 per hour So much for 15$ an hour minimum wage Think before you vote people. Users on Facebook saw posts like this in their feed: This is wrong. Sanders made no such remark during the debate. For a full transcript of the debate, go here. Also, this math does not consider the standard deduction before workers would pay on differing levels of income. Under Sanders' plan on how to pay for \"Medicare for all\", he recommends reforming the personal income tax system by increasing the progressive income tax on wealthy Americans. His plan, found here, includes: - 40 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000 - 45 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million - 50 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million - 52 percent on income above $10 million. Sanders claims middle-class families would save money under his plan due to a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households: Under this option, a typical family of four earning $50,000, after taking the standard deduction, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All - just $844 a year - saving that family over $4,400 a year. Because of the standard deduction, families of four making less than $29,000 a year would not pay this premium. Sanders' plan is the most ambitious of any Democratic presidential candidate in transforming the nation's healthcare system. It has come under scrutiny, and he has received much flak for his lack of detail on how much the plan would cost American taxpayers. A good deal of this criticism was thrown at him, including from Pete Buttigieg, during Wednesday's debate. But this Facebook post, for example, includes false quotes and wrongly interprets Sanders' plan.",

        "claim": "Walmarted looted during a December 25, 2022 snow storm",
        "doc": "\"NEW: #Walmart store devastated by ongoing looting in #Buffalo, #NewYork,\" says a December 26, 2022 Facebook post. The video pans across a ransacked Walmart with boxes strewn across the floor and shelves left empty. Similar posts can be found across social media, including on Twitter and the Chinese social media platform Weibo, many having received thousands of views. A deadly blizzard hit the Buffalo area on December 25, 2022 resulting in the death of nearly 40 people. But claims that the looting was filmed during the recent weather catastrophe is false; the video predates the storm. AFP conducted a keyword search and found the same video posted on multiple YouTube channels two years before the monster storm. Examining the frames below, elements from the clip on the left -- purported to be from Buffalo -- match those from Philadelphia, on the right. The Buffalo Police Department's anti-looting detail announced 10 arrests as of December 28, but Walmart confirmed its stores were not impacted. \"I can confirm that no stores in the Buffalo, NY area reported looting during the recent storms,\" a Walmart spokesman told AFP by email. The footage was captured in the Port Richmond neighborhood in Philadelphia after the fatal shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man who was gunned down by police in October 2020 while armed with a knife. A nationwide movement protesting police brutality also saw incidents in which some businesses were looted -- including the Walmart shown in the video. The Philadelphia Police Department commented on the break-in on Twitter at the time of the event: *Alert* A large crowd of appx 1000 is looting businesses in the area of Castor and Aramingo. Avoid the area AFP has previously reported on looting footage shared out of context here and here.",

        "claim": "Video shows newly designed plastic bank notes for Pakistan in 2022",
        "doc": "\"New currency note Pakistan,\" reads the caption alongside the video. The clip -- viewed more than 1.5 million times -- was shared in a Facebook post on November 9, 2021. The video's narrator says in Urdu: \"New Year and new currency. Pakistanis will have to use plastic banknotes from the new year.\" \"The colour and design of the 50-rupee note have been completely changed. The red 100-rupee currency note will now be green and will have the photo of Islamia College Peshawar on both sides. It will be made of plastic. The 500 and 1,000-rupee notes will also be made of plastic,\" he continues. \"The new plastic notes have been designed by a Fine Arts student of Peshawar University Noor ul Hassan.\" Similar videos showing the purported banknotes circulated on Facebook here, here and here. However, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said it did not commission the notes shown in the reports. \"The design of polymer (plastic) banknotes circulating in social media is an artwork of a student of Peshawar University, which has not been commissioned by the State Bank,\" a spokesman told AFP. \"SBP is currently studying the viability of polymer notes keeping in view the use of currency notes by the general public and its overall cost. Any decision to consider polymer currency notes will be made based on the results of the feasibility study.\" The SBP also rejected the misleading reports in a Facebook post on November 9. On November 9, Peshawar University posted a video on Facebook which features the same design shown in the misleading reports. \"Designing new banknotes is Noor ul Hassan's thesis topic for the completion of his master's degree,\" the narrator says in Pashto. \"His supervisor, Assistant Professor Younas Masood says that he chose a difficult topic for his thesis but worked hard to complete it.\" Below is a screenshot comparison of the banknote featured in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and in Peshawar University's video (R): Hassan told AFP he designed the banknotes for his master's degree dissertation, which he said had \"no connection\" to the SBP. \"It was for my thesis. Every student selects a topic and has to say how useful it can be. I selected currency design and said it will not only attract tourism but will also be more secure if printed on plastic material instead of paper, to curb the menace of counterfeit currency,\" he said. \"The State Bank has no connection with my thesis.\" Hassan's thesis supervisor Younas Masood also told AFP the banknotes were designed as part of his master's course.",

        "claim": "Flag made of Iranian women's chopped hair during September 2022 protests",
        "doc": "A picture of a flag made of black hair was shared here on Facebook on September 21, 2022. Its Hindi-language caption translates as: \"World\u2019s most powerful image comes from Iran, where local women protesters have chopped off their hair and hoisted it as a flag.\" The post goes on to describe that the protests in Iran were triggered by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini on September 16, 2022, after she was detained by the country's notorious morality police for \"not wearing her hijab properly\". Iranian women, including university students and even schoolgirls, are at the forefront of the biggest wave of social unrest to grip Iran in almost three years -- they have been marching without the mandatory head covering, burning hijabs and cutting off their hair. Rights groups say at least 108 people, including children, have died in the continued crackdown on the demonstrations, AFP reported. The photo also circulated alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, as well as in an English tweet from Indian news site First Post, and in a Turkish post, which has been retweeted more than 5,500 times. A similar image also appeared on Facebook here on September 24, 2022, captioned: \"Chopped hair as a flag of protest by Iranian women!!\" It also circulated in similar Hindi posts on Facebook here, and on Twitter here and here. The claim about the \"Iranian women's hair flag\" was also tweeted by prominent figures, from artist Ai Weiwei to author Taslima Nasreen, garnering more than 1,000 shares. However, the claim is false. A Google reverse image search found that the pictures were taken from Belgian visual artist Edith Dekyndt's video installation titled \"Ombre indig\u00e8ne\" (Indigenous Shadow) in 2014. The first image appeared in a June 2020 interview with the artist here, captioned: \"Edyth Dekyndt, Ombre indig\u00e8ne, video, 2014\". The second image was published here, on the website of Wiels contemporary art centre in Brussels, on the occasion of Dekyndt's exhibition in 2016. The photo is captioned: \"Edith Dekyndt, OMBRE INDIGENE Part.2, Martinique Island, 2014.\" On the page 31 of the exhibition catalogue, the artwork's description partly reads: \"A flag made of hair was stuck in the ground and filmed on top of rocks on the Diamant coast, in Martinique. There, precisely, on the night of 8 April 1830, a clandestine slave boat transporting a hundred African captives washed up on the rocks before being entirely destroyed.\" The Caribbean island of Martinique is an overseas region of France and historically, a port of call for slave ships. In the 2020 interview, Dekyndt said the artwork was inspired by the work of author and philosopher Edouard Glissant, one of the most important writers of the French Caribbean and whose writings reflected on colonialism, slavery, racism and cultural diversity. Below are screenshot comparisons of the images shared in the misleading posts (L) and the genuine images of Dekyndt's artwork (R): Dekyndt's video installation can be seen in this footage of her 2016 exhibition at Wiels, uploaded on the artist's website. Magali Wyns, a spokesperson from Galerie Greta Meert, a Brussels art gallery which represents Dekyndt, confirmed that the piece was not related to the current protests in Iran. \"The work entitled 'Ombre Indig\u00e8ne Part 2 (\u00cele de la Martinique)' is a video installation -- not an image -- created in 2014 by Edith Dekyndt,\" Wyns told AFP in an email. AFP has debunked other false claims about the 2022 Iranian demonstrations here, here and here.",

        "doc": "\"Over 240,000 'unverified' ballots have already been sent out in Pennsylvania, a total mess,\" Trump said on October 28, 2022, on Truth Social, a platform he launched in February 2022 after being banned from Twitter. \"The Democrats are playing games again because they know they are in deep trouble after unleashing skyrocketing crime, record Inflation, a war against American Energy, etc.\" The claim has also circulated on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, with some posts sharing links to online articles. The 240,000 figure stems from a letter sent by several Republican state representatives to Leigh Chapman, acting secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \"As of October 21, 2022, records of 2022 Mail Ballot Data shows that counties have already mailed over 240,000 unverified ballots,\" the lawmakers wrote. Pennsylvania, which voted for Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, is one of the battleground states that will decide which political party controls Congress after the November 8 midterm elections. It was also the subject of debunked conspiracy theories about the outcome of the 2020 presidential contest -- including some promoted by Trump and his allies. The former president's recent claim about \"unverified ballots\" in Pennsylvania is misleading, as well, according to state officials. \"That is misinformation. Any mail-in or absentee ballot from a voter whose identification cannot be verified by the sixth day after the election is not counted,\" says a statement released by the Pennsylvania Department of State on October 27. The claims \"conflate an application for a mail ballot and an approved mail ballot,\" the statement says. County election offices are required to provide absentee ballots \"to any registered voter who requests one,\" according to the Pennsylvania Department of State. This includes voters who do not initially provide proof of identification with their application. For those who do, their identities are verified by the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors, which integrates all state-wide registration records, allowing the department to cross-reference data -- including driver's license registrations -- to verify identities. If they do not or require further verification, their application is labeled \"NV (not verified).\" That does not mean voters' identities will not be verified after they provide their state driver\u2019s license information or the last four digits of their Social Security Number. Mail-in ballots submitted by voters whose identity cannot be verified will not be included in the final vote count. As of October 28, there were fewer than 7,600 ballot applications in Pennslyvania requiring voter identity verification, according to Chapman, who responded to Republican Representative Francis X. Ryan in a separate letter. \"Please keep in mind that this is simply a point-in-time number, which will continue to decrease as the election gets closer and as voters provide required proof of identification,\" Chapman said. \"Ballots can be verified up to six days after the election.\" AFP has fact-checked other false and misleading claims about the US midterm elections here, here and here.",

        "doc": "Social media posts circulating during the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse claim his mother drove him to the town in the US state of Wisconsin where he shot three people. But the prosecutor trying the case says there is no evidence to support the claim, Rittenhouse and a friend testified about the people who accompanied them and did not list his mother, and she told a newspaper that she was in a neighboring state and did not know what her son was doing. \"Why are we just glazing over the fact that Kyle Rittenhouse's mother put her minor child in a vehicle, drove him across state lines and dropped him off in the middle of a riot armed with an assault rifle? Why is she not behind bars?\" says a November 13, 2021 Instagram post. Screenshot of an Instagram post taken on November 15, 2021 The claim, which also appeared on Facebook in 2021, circulated online in the days after the August 25, 2020 shootings in Kenosha, with some people sharing a photo of an armed woman they claimed was Wendy Rittenhouse. The photographer came forward at the time to say that the image was taken in a different town. Kyle Rittenshouse is on trial for killing two men and wounding a third during unrest in Kenosha that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. Rittenhouse faces five counts -- one count each of intentional homicide, reckless homicide and attempted intentional homicide, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety. But his mother did not drive her son to Kenosha on the day of the shootings. \"There is no evidence that Wendy drove the defendant to Kenosha on 8/25/20,\" Thomas Binger, the prosecutor in Rittenhouse's trial, told AFP. While testifying on November 10, 2021, Rittenhouse gave a detailed account of the day of the shootings, and did not list his mother among the people who were present. \"I did go downtown in the morning of August 25th,\" he said, adding after being questioned by the prosecution: \"I went there with Dominick Black, my sister McKenzie Rittenhouse, and Ray Dickhart.\" During his testimony, Black said that before noon on the 25th, \"me, him (Rittenhouse) and my brother Ray decided to go down to the lake (in downtown Kenosha) and kind of just look at how things were.\" He did not mention Rittenhouse's mother. And in an interview with the Chicago Tribune in November 2020, Wendy Rittenhouse said that she did not know what her son was doing on August 25, and that she was in the state of Illinois getting a COVID-19 test and running errands with her eldest daughter. Media reports about the shootings and the subsequent trial also did not say that his mother drove Rittenhouse to Kenosha.

        "claim": "\"The Virginia population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent.\"",
        "doc": "A conservative group says Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly have failed to harness state spending. The Virginia First Foundation is lamenting a recently revealed $1.5 billion projected budget shortfall. It posted a game show-themed video on its website. The narrator asks what\u2019s behind \"Window Number 1?\" The answer is this claim: \"The Virginia population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent,\" the group\u2019s video says. The video identifies three House Republican leaders as \"big spenders\": Speaker Bill Howell of Stafford; Majority Leader Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights; and Chris Jones of Suffolk, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We wondered whether the foundation\u2019s statistics are right. Let\u2019s start with Virginia\u2019s population increase. U.S. Census Bureau tallies show the state\u2019s population stood at nearly 7.6 million in 2005 and rose to more than 8.3 million in 2015. That\u2019s an increase of about 10 percent, a bit higher than the foundation says. Now, let\u2019s move to the foundation\u2019s claim about a 38 percent increase in state spending per capita - the amount of state spending divided by the number of people in Virginia. Steve Waters, a founding board member of the foundation, pointed to a couple of sources to show that state spending per person has spiked over the past decade. The first is a table from the 2004-06 budget which says that when fiscal 2005 ended in mid-2005, the state\u2019s per capita spending in its operating budget was projected to be $3,894. Waters also points to a chart from BallotPedia, which says that the state\u2019s per capita spending in fiscal 2015 was $5,483, a number culled from a figures compiled last year by the National Association of State Budget Officers. Those per capita figures amount to a 41 percent increase from 2005 to 2015 - a bit higher than the foundation\u2019s estimate. We also looked at state spending by examining annual reports by the state\u2019s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, a watchdog agency. Using tables on the state\u2019s annual population and overall operating expenses in a given year, we came up with a trend line similar to the foundation\u2019s. Our calculations show per capita state spending was $3,861 in 2005 and rose to $5,642 in 2015 - a 46 percent increase. So in raw dollars, the foundation\u2019s state spending figures are in the ballpark and, if anything, underestimate the increase. But there\u2019s a big factor these calculations ignore - the effects of inflation. A dollar in 2015 wasn\u2019t worth as much as a dollar in 2005. When we ran our figures through the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, we found the increase in per capita spending instead was about 21 percent - nearly half the size of the foundation\u2019s growth rate. There\u2019s another point to consider. All of the computations are based on total spending figures in the state budget. But legislators directly control only about 40 percent of the budget called the general fund. The fund, about $20.4 billion this year, is predominantly raised through state income and sales taxes and is used to pay for education, public safety and health programs. The remainder of the budget, more than $30 billion called the non-general fund, comes from sources over which legislators have limited or no control, such as college tuition, federal grants and hospital fees. These distinctions are important to note when looking at the context of the foundation\u2019s claim, which blames GOP lawmakers for poorly reining state spending. JLARC noted in a report last year that the main driver of higher state spending were non-general fund increases in federal dollars; tuition payments to colleges that set their own rates; and child support payments. So to get to the bottom on this claim, we looked at per capita spending in the general fund over the 10-year period that the foundation cited. JLARC figures show it rose by 20.5 percent in raw dollars - from $1,819 in 2005 to $2,191 in 2015. When adjusting those figures for inflation, the spending actually declined by about 1 percent - from $2,207 in 2005 to $2,191 in 2015. Our ruling The Virginia First Foundation says the state\u2019s \"population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent.\" The conservative group specifically faulted three GOP lawmakers for not holding the line. The population increase, we should note, is closer to 10 percent. In raw dollars, the increase in per capita spending is 46 percent - a little higher than the group says. But the group\u2019s calculations omit some key factors. When adjusted for inflation, the per capita increase for the entire state budget falls to 21 percent. Even then, the figure still holds state lawmakers responsible for a major portion of the state budget over which they have little or no control. If we focus on the portion of the budget that legislators fully direct - the general fund - per capita spending in raw dollars increased by 20 percent from 2005 to 2015. When adjusted for inflation, it actually decreased by about 1 percent. So the foundation\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That\u2019s makes it Half True.",

        "claim": "Eric Schmitt \u201csponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars\u201d on cargo hub for airlines \"owned by China's Communist Party\u201d and \"voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland.\"",
        "doc": "Some Republicans running for open U.S. Senate seats are being hit from the right with attack ads that accuse them of cozying up to China. One of the ads, from a conservative super PAC that is funded by a large Illinois GOP donor, used the Winter Olympics in Beijing as a backdrop to brand Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt as \"good for China, bad for Missouri.\" The TV ad from Team PAC, which is supporting former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens in the race, is called \"Mao Money.\" It aired Feb. 4 during the broadcast of the opening ceremonies of the Games. The ad opened with images of fireworks behind the words \"China 2022.\" The narrator said, \"How did China get so powerful? Friends like Eric Schmitt.\" Then it makes a two-part claim. \"Schmitt sponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars to create a cargo hub here for airlines owned by China's Communist Party to flood Missouri markets with cheap Chinese imports,\" the narrator continued, \"and Schmitt voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland.\" Both parts of the claim are rooted in bills Schmitt supported in the legislature, but they omit important context about the effect of the legislation. The first part of the super PAC\u2019s claim centers on a 2011 bill Schmitt proposed as a state senator, connected to what was known as the China Hub Project. As reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the initial bill would have offered up to $480 million worth of tax breaks over 15 years to spur foreign trade through Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The bill was proposed as St. Louis leaders entered their fourth year of negotiations with Chinese officials over a freight hub at the airport, and two months after the Chinese directed their largest freight carrier \u2014 China Cargo Airlines \u2014 to begin direct talks with the airport, the story said. Schmitt argued at the time that the tax credits would be issued only if certain investment and trade occurred. His bill called for $420 million of incentives to build warehouses and distribution centers within a 50-mile radius of Lambert; and $60 million in tax credits for companies shipping exports out of Missouri. Schmitt said facilities built under the bill could be used to store meat that could be sent to China. Without the bill, Schmitt didn\u2019t see the China hub materializing, the St. Louis Beacon reported. The Team PAC ad didn\u2019t mention the hub\u2019s potential to handle exports, but one of the articles it cited, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, said the City of St. Louis was negotiating with China Cargo Airlines \"to bring Chinese-made goods to America through Lambert and to take American goods and agricultural products back overseas.\" To back its claim that the airline was \"owned by China's Communist Party,\" the super PAC ad cited a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for 2011 by Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, in connection with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The 2011 filing does not make clear the precise level of Chinese government ownership in China Cargo. Here\u2019s what it does say: Most of the major airline companies in China were majority-owned either by the central government or by provincial or municipal governments in China. The Chinese government controlled a 59.53% equity stake in a holding company that was China Eastern\u2019s biggest shareholder. China Eastern owned 51% of \"subsidiary\" China Cargo. So the filing indicates that the Communist government had at least an indirect stake in China Cargo. Under the version ultimately approved by the Missouri legislature, Schmitt\u2019s bill would have provided $360 million in tax credits. But the bill was not signed into law, and the project was scrapped. The second part of the claim alludes to a 2013 state law, which Schmitt voted for, on the ownership of agricultural land by foreign businesses. Before the law, foreign businesses generally were prohibited from owning agricultural land in Missouri; the change loosened the prohibition, capping foreign ownership at 1% of Missouri\u2019s total agricultural acreage. The measure was approved over the veto of then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. The law allowed a Chinese company, Shuanghui International of Hong Kong, to buy Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which owned Missouri farmland at the time, the Post-Dispatch reported. But what Schmitt voted for was not approval of any specific land purchases by China. China is a recurring theme in ads for Senate contests in several states. In a race for an open seat in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz accused fellow Republican David McCormick of giving Chinese companies billions of dollars through the hedge fund he ran. A super PAC supporting Republican Josh Mandel for an open seat in Ohio claimed that Republican Jane Timken\u2019s family business moved jobs to China. Meanwhile, Alex Lasry, one of the Democrats challenging GOP incumbent Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, pledged to \"finally stand up to China.\" The Missouri race is to succeed two-term GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, who is not seeking re-election. The primary is Aug. 2 for the seat, which is rated as solid Republican. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 after facing a felony computer tampering charge, which was dropped, and allegations related to an extramarital affair. Schmitt formerly served as Missouri\u2019s secretary of state and as a state senator. The other GOP candidates include U.S. Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long; Long\u2019s campaign gained attention for running an ad claiming that Democrats \"rigged\" the 2020 presidential election. Also among the GOP candidates are state Senate President Dave Schatz and attorney Mark McCloskey, who is best known for pointing a gun at protesters when they marched past his St. Louis home. Team PAC raised $2.5 million in 2021, according to the Federal Election Commission \u2014 all of it from a suburban Chicago billionaire, Republican donor Richard Uihlein. Uihlein, who owns a giant shipping supply company, is the second-largest individual donor to outside spending groups for the 2022 campaign cycle, having contributed $10.2 million, according to the nonprofit Open Secrets. As a super PAC, Team PAC may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates. Team PAC said Schmitt \"sponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars to create a cargo hub here for airlines owned by China's Communist Party\" and \"voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland.\" Schmitt\u2019s 2011 bill initially called for $480 million in tax credits, not state expenditures, for a proposed air cargo hub to support international trade, including exports, with a Chinese airline as a potential partner; the tax credits would have been contingent on investment and trade occurring. The bill did not become law. Schmitt\u2019s vote for a 2013 bill that became law allowed for foreign businesses to own a limited amount of agricultural land in Missouri. The statement is based on bills that Schmitt supported in the legislature, but it leaves out important context about his vote and the effect of the legislation. We rate it Half True.",

        "claim": "350,000 troops being dishonorably discharged for refusing Covid-19 vaccine",
        "doc": "\"An estimated 350,000 of our military service members are being dishonorably discharged for refusing to take a completely unnecessary and experimental mRNA nanotech injection,\" the October 8, 2021 article on Substack says. The Pentagon said in August that it would make Covid-19 vaccination mandatory as infections from the Delta variant of the virus were surging. Claims that the vaccination requirement could trigger dishonorable discharges -- which result in a loss of benefits and make obtaining civilian employment difficult -- sparked outrage on social media. But no troops have been discharged for refusing the vaccine at this point, and the number who may face action is nowhere near the level suggested in the article, according to a Pentagon spokesman. \"I can tell you that 350k members are not facing dishonorable discharge,\" Major Charlie Dietz told AFP. \"I am not sure where that number came from but I can tell you that for the Active Duty service members, more than 96.79 percent have received at least one shot. As a total force, to include the National Guard and Reserves, we are over 80 percent with at least one dose,\" he said. With an active duty force of roughly 1.4 million, the Pentagon figures would mean fewer than 45,000 service members have yet to begin the vaccination process. \"I am unaware of any service members being discharged at this time because the deadline for the services has not hit yet ,\" Dietz added. Pentagon officials have said they would seek to use a variety of tools to deal with the unvaccinated and were unlikely to resort to courts martial, the step which would be required for a dishonorable discharge, for those rejecting the vaccine mandate for military personnel. \"It's a lawful order, so obviously if after all that effort the lawful order is disobeyed, there could be disciplinary action, but the secretary (of defense) believes that there's lots of tools available to leaders, short of using the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), to get these troops to do the right thing for themselves and for their units,\" press secretary John Kirby said during an October 12 briefing, referring to laws governing US military personnel. Dietz made a similar point, saying: \"If counseling and informal efforts fail to convince, a member\u2019s chain of command could, as a last resort, take appropriate administrative or appropriate disciplinary action commensurate to the alleged offense.\" \"But again, we view it as highly unlikely that commanders will find it necessary to take action under the UCMJ. They have a range of other tools available to them and will ultimately make judgments based on the circumstances of each case in consultation with legal and medical professionals,\" he said. Vaccination deadlines vary depending on the service branch. Active duty Air Force personnel must be fully vaccinated by November 2, with the Navy deadline November 28 and December 15 for the Army. Service members are able to seek vaccine exemptions for religious or medical reasons. The Navy has said that service members who refuse vaccination will be expelled, but that they would receive a general honorable discharge. The article also includes a series of other inaccurate claims that AFP Fact Check has debunked. These include assertions that the shots contain nanotechnology, that unvaccinated veterans will be denied benefits, and that vaccination increases the threat of the spread of Covid-19. Since 2020, AFP has debunked more than 1,000 false and misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic. All are available here.",

        "claim": "\"It was a 100 percent lie that (Donald Trump\u2019s) election unleashed anti-Semitism. \u2026 Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend.\"",
        "doc": "A segment hosted by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on May 18, 2017, got a little heated. Lemon and one of his guests, conservative radio host Dennis Prager, sparred over an apparent increase in anti-Semitic incidents after the 2016 presidential election, and who was to blame. Prager said there was no rise in anti-Semitic incidents, and the incidents that did occur didn\u2019t have anything to do with Donald Trump. \"It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism,\" Prager said. \"Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend.\" Is he correct? We found that Prager has a point about the bomb threats to Jewish community centers largely being the work of two suspects who have since been arrested. However, there is evidence that the number of anti-Semitic incidents other than bomb threats did increase after the election. (Prager did not respond to email inquiries.) The suspects To date, the FBI announced two arrests related to the bomb threats. (We should note that the two individuals cited below have not been tried yet.) The first came on March 3, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York announced a charge of cyberstalking against a St. Louis man, Juan Thompson. Thompson was charged with \"allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the Anti-Defamation League.\" The Justice Department said that Thompson appeared to have made \"at least eight of the JCC threats as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate\" his victim. Prager was wrong that Thompson tried to impress a girlfriend; he is charged with trying to implicate an ex-girlfriend in crimes she didn\u2019t commit. As for calling him a \"black radical,\" that\u2019s a somewhat subjective. The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis newspaper, said that as a black journalist, Thompson had filed \"searing dispatches about injustices in Baltimore, Mississippi and Chicago. He relished the opportunity to strike back at what he calls an \u2018oppressive, anti-black, racial supremacist, capitalist system\u2019 that kneecaps all but the country's rich and white in the pursuit of basic civil rights and opportunities.\" Then, on April 21, the Justice Department announced that charges had been filed against Michael Ron David Kadar, an 18-year-old resident of Israel with dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. The charges in question were for making telephone bomb threats against Jewish facilities in central Florida and for providing false information to police in Georgia. Then-FBI director James Comey said in a statement that \"this kind of behavior is not a prank, and it isn't harmless. It\u2019s a federal crime. It scares innocent people, disrupts entire communities, and expends limited law enforcement resources.\" So Prager\u2019s on target when he cites Thompson and Kadar as the two individuals charged so far with making Jewish community center bomb threats. The bomb threats Somewhat less certain is the total number of threats called in to Jewish community centers. As we noted, officials have tied Thompson to eight calls. Meanwhile, the criminal complaint against Kadar alleged that between Jan. 4 and March 7, Kadar made \"at least 245 telephone calls involving bomb threats and active shooter threats. A significant portion of the threats targeted Jewish community centers and other historically Jewish institutions such as Jewish schools and Anti-Defamation League offices.\" The FBI declined to comment further to PolitiFact, citing the ongoing investigation. So the exact number of threats the two individuals made -- once duplicate calls and calls made to non-Jewish targets are set aside -- is hard to nail down. However, the number of calls they made appears to be in the ballpark of the number of reported bomb threats. It\u2019s not certain that threats numbered in the \"hundreds,\" as Prager said, but if not, they weren\u2019t far off. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that tracks hate crimes, has tracked upwards of 170 such threats made internationally and domestically. And the Anti-Defamation League -- another group that tracks hate crimes, and which was a target of a number of the calls in question -- has identified 167 such threats in the United States in Canada. (The ADL\u2019s tally did not count other countries, as the SPLC did.) Given this data, Prager has a point that most of the bomb threats are traceable to the two individuals who have been charged so far, and he\u2019s also correct that Kadar has been charged with making many more than Thompson. Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, said that there are probably a modest number of bomb threats not traceable to either of these two suspects. \"The two individuals that Prager mentioned accounted for the vast majority of the bomb threats, but not all of them,\" Tuchman said. That said, Tuchman added one further piece of evidence that Thompson and Kadar account for the vast bulk of threats: \"Thankfully, there have been no further bomb threats recently,\" he said. Anti-Semitic incidents more broadly But if Prager has described the situation with the Jewish community center bomb threats with reasonable accuracy, he has engaged in a bit of cherry-picking by ignoring other signs of increased anti-Semitism after the election. \"Even if the bomb threats are discounted, we still saw an increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the first quarter of 2017,\" Tuchman said. \"Not including the bomb threats, there were 380 total incidents in the first quarter of 2017, up from 291 incidents in the first quarter of 2016. That\u2019s an increase of 31 percent.\" Incidents in 2016 cited by ADL include instances of harassment (such as voice mails or social media attacks), vandalism (such as graffiti) and assault (including one incident in which two shots were fired at a victim\u2019s vehicle). Tuchman added that the number of incidents in December 2016 were almost 70 percent higher than the number of incidents in December 2015. Tuchman cautioned that ADL \"believes that the presidential campaign was a factor in the increase in anti-Semitic incidents, but only one factor.\" But even if the election was only one factor among many, the rise in anti-Semitic incidents overall call into question Prager\u2019s assertion that it\u2019s a \"100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism.\" Our ruling Prager said, \"It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism. \u2026 Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend.\" He\u2019s close to the mark in describing the overwhelming role of two suspects in making bomb threats against Jewish targets earlier this year. However, Prager ignores a documented rise in anti-Semitic incidents beyond bomb threats. We rate his statement Half True.",

On 13 November, five days after a wildfire effectively wiped the entire town of Paradise off the map, egregiously faulty memes began to emerge implying that the fires were set to clear the way for the construction of California\u2019s High Speed Rail: Sure, by placing two extremely low-res images sort of near each other and hoping your readers squint their eyes, one might convince a few that the red outline purported to be the extent of the California wildfires looked similar to the proposed map of the California high-speed rail. There are, of course, several problems with the comparison presented. First and probably most significant is the fact that the map purporting to show the extent of the wildfires (which, astute observers may have noted, appears to have consumed wholesale the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco, and Sacramento) is actually a map of \u201cred flag\u201d warnings put out by Cal Fire on 11 November 2018. A red flag warning \u201cis issued for weather events which may result in extreme fire behavior that will occur within 24 hours\u201d and does not, as implied by the meme, represent areas that have burned. A #RedFlagWarning has significantly increased in size, now spanning across California through Monday, due to gusty winds and low humidity.

The meme makes use of a map presented on the website America2050.org, but below we used a more recent map produced by the California High-Speed Rail Authority in May 2016, which shows the \u201cproposed statewide alignment\u201d for the railway, and overlaid it with the (largely irrelevant) map of the red flag warning issued on 11 November 2018.

        "claim": "Allowing all Bush income tax cuts to expire on Dec. 31 \"will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America.\"",
        "doc": "In Washington, a simmering political battle is boiling over this hot summer. Some say it could hurt the checkbooks of virtually every American.The topic is taxes, specifically what will happen if the tax cuts approved under the presidency of George W. Bush expire at the end of this year.U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., offered his theory in a guest column in the July 28 edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\"Now, these tax cuts are set to expire on Dec. 31, and allowing them to do so will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America,\" Isakson wrote.Republicans are pushing to continue the tax cuts in all income categories. President Barack Obama has called for the cuts to end, but only for high-income Americans. The tax cuts would end for individuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000. Many Democratic leaders in Congress have publicly stated they support the president's proposal.Neither Democratic leaders nor Obama have said they want all of the tax cuts to expire.Some loyal AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers asked us to investigate some of the claims in the column by Isakson, who is running for re-election this November against Democrat Michael Thurmond, Georgia's outgoing labor commissioner, and Libertarian Chuck Donovan. We decided to focus on the claim whether it does amount to the largest tax increase in U.S. history, since other politicians are repeating it.PolitiFact's national website this week gave former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin a \"Pants on Fire\" ruling because she implied in a televised interview that eliminating the tax cuts for only high-income Americans would amount to the largest tax increase in U.S. history.Isakson, however, was more inclusive in his statement, which assumed all of the Bush tax cuts for all income groups could be eliminated. His argument was different than Palin's.Here's some background on the tax cuts. In 2001 and 2003, the Republican-led Congress approved a series of cuts that reduced the income tax rate in several categories. If the tax cuts expire, the 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent tax brackets will revert to 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Isakson's office argued in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia three reasons its statement is correct. The senator's office says it's the largest in terms of dollar amount, the largest in terms of how many taxpayers are affected and largest in terms of revenue effect as a percentage of the national gross domestic product.There's little research about the impact of ending the tax cuts in comparison with past tax increases or cuts.Jim Nunns, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, shared some Treasury data with AJC PolitiFact Georgia. He included a 2006 report called \"Revenue effects of major tax bills.\" The report includes a chart that shows revenue estimates of tax increases and cuts as a percentage of the gross domestic product.Most economists say that measuring taxes as a percentage of GDP is the most accurate way to compare tax increases that were passed years apart.The measure takes into account how large the taxes are in relation to the economy in which they are levied, and it eliminates the effects of inflation.The 1942 tax increase, approved to help fund America's fight during World War II, was 5 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Treasury Department data. Treasury officials say the end of all of the current tax cuts would result in 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Our own analysis also found it would be about 2 percent.Isakson's office said the 1942 tax increase should be viewed with caution because the data are inconsistent with later tax information. The 2006 Treasury Department report says a consistent source of revenue estimates was not available for all bills between 1940 and 1967. Isakson's office believes the better comparison is to a tax increase in 1982 that resulted in 0.53 percent of the gross domestic product in the first year and 1.23 percent by the fourth year, according to its analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.CBO estimates show allowing the three main provisions of the Bush administration tax cuts to expire would result in an additional $209.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 and $251.7 billion by fiscal year 2014. The 1942 tax increase resulted in billions coming in to federal tax coffers in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the 2006 Treasury Department report. That total would be about $115 billion in today's dollars.Nunns, of the Tax Policy Center, said it's fair to compare the 1942 tax increase with what would happen if the tax cuts expire. The 1942 estimate came from the Congressional Record, which is the official record of the U.S. Congress.\"If you look at the current dollar measure, you can see that would be an accurate statement,\" Nunns said of Isakson's statement. \"If you look at it from the size of the economy, then it's not.\"Georgia State University economics professor Sally Wallace said she worked with Nunns and Jerry Tempalski, the author of the 2006 Treasury Department report, and thinks it's fair to compare the 1942 tax increase with the end of the tax cuts.\"An overly conservative take on the early Treasury data would still lead to the conclusion that the 1942 act had a substantially larger impact on the economy, measured via GDP [than the end of the Bush administration tax cuts],\" said Wallace, chairwoman of the economics department.The numbers show Isakson has a strong case that allowing these tax cuts to expire would result in more revenue than at any point in U.S. history. The senator's case concerning why it is a larger percentage of the gross domestic product than the 1942 tax increase is weaker. The 2006 Treasury Department report said a consistent source for the revenue estimates was not available. It did not say that the estimates were unreliable.The GDP is considered a more accurate way to measure the economy. Isakson's statement is misleading when you base his statement on the GDP. Therefore, we rate his statement as Barely True.",

        "claim": "Says less than half of 1 percent of all the Texas legislators who ever served draw \"a benefit\" from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges.",
        "doc": "State Rep. Doug Miller declared that very few legislators, who are paid $7,200 a year plus expenses, have qualified to draw pension benefits based on the much greater salary of a state district judge. During Texas House debate May 21, 2013, the New Braunfels Republican pointed out that a legislator has to serve eight years to qualify for the pension if he or she retires at age 60, or 10 years \"if you retired at age 50.\" (Actually, a legislator needs to serve 12 years to retire with the benefits at age 50, according to a booklet from the Employees Retirement System of Texas.) Miller further declared that it takes 43 years and six months of service to qualify for 100 percent of the pension, which is equal to the salary of a state district judge. For each year of service, a legislator qualifies for a pension equal to 2.3 percent of the judicial salary, which has been $125,000 since 2005, Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman reported in a column posted online May 30, 2013. Miller wasn\u2019t done. After noting the average tenures of current lawmakers, he said, \"Less than half a percent of the people that ever served, and there have been over 5,000 people (who) served in this House, less than half a percent ever receive a benefit under this (pension) plan.\" We took that as Miller saying that less than half of 1 percent of House and Texas Senate members ever drew a pension benefit, an interpretation Miller confirmed by telephone. Is that right? To our request for backup information, Miller\u2019s office sent us a document indicating that 63 of the 181 current members of the House and Senate, 35 percent, will have served 10 years or more through 2013. This was accompanied by a 27-page document, dated May 21, 2013, and attributed to the Legislative Reference Library, listing legislators since statehood who have served 10 years or more. According to news accounts, lawmakers tied legislator pensions to the salary of a state district judge in 1975. By telephone, Mary Jane Wardlow, a spokeswoman for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, said that a 1969 law previously allowed legislators to contribute a portion of their pay check to the retirement system, which would potentially have qualified them for pensions tied to their own salaries. Unsaid: The 1975 law set in motion better long-term rewards. And according to a May 17, 2013, Texas Tribune news article, lawmakers this year were poised to increase the base salary of state district judges by 12 percent, to $140,000, which would increase the legislative pension benefit by at least $2,760 a year. \"Actual benefits vary depending on choices lawmakers make in their plans (they can opt out, though few do so), on other pensions, and non-legislative government service and so on,\" the story said, with eligible members qualifying for annual pensions of $27,760 to $140,000. The story said that former House Speaker Tom Craddick, a House member since the late 1960s, would be subject to a cap of $140,000 \"since the benefit can't exceed the amount of the judicial salary it's based on.\" Also, the story said, retired lawmakers would draw the increases in pension payments, too. \"The retired elected officials class currently includes 513 former legislators, district attorneys and others,\" the Tribune said, \"as well as 137 survivor beneficiaries, each of whom collects an average of $44,196 in annual benefits.\" Miller did not specify how he determined the number of legislators who have drawn a benefit from the pension. But by email, his chief of staff, Fritz Reinig, pointed out the reference library\u2019s online database listing every legislator since 1846. Texas joined the United States in late 1845. Working from the library\u2019s lists, we estimated the number of legislators who at least became eligible for the pension, conservatively sticking with Miller's formulation tied to 10 years of service rather than the minimum of 8 years needed to qualify. By our count, about 380 legislators served 10 years or more from 1969 through the 2013 regular session. Over those years, reference librarian Catherine Wusterhausen told us by email, 971 individuals served as legislators. Put another way, then, approximately 39 percent of legislators would have qualified for the pension benefit, though this is not to say that each one signed up for it; that\u2019s not public information, Wardlow said. Yet Miller\u2019s claim referred to all legislators since statehood. Our search of the library\u2019s database for every legislator since 1846 delivered 5,515 names, which was probably too high. Wusterhausen told us by email that, like her 971 count, this figure would include temporary acting representatives and those later removed following an election contest plus individuals elected but not sworn in. Conservatively speaking, still, our estimated 380 legislators who could have qualified for the pension comprise 7 percent of all Texas legislators through history. What gives? Miller, apprised of our analysis, said his intent was to show that few legislators serve long enough to qualify for the potential pensions. From his list, for instance, it appears that nine of the House\u2019s 150 members will have served 21 years or more through 2013. That's how long a member would have to serve to potentially draw a pension equal to half a district judge\u2019s salary. Miller agreed his \"half of 1 percent\" claim did not come out as intended. \"It\u2019s the heat of the debate,\" he said. Our ruling Miller said that \"less than half of 1 percent\" of Texas legislators through history have drawn a benefit from the pension tied to the salary of a state district judge. Granted, the state cannot reveal which legislators have qualified or chosen to take the pension. But by our reckoning based on legislative rosters, more than 7 percent of legislators through history could have qualified for the pension benefit. That\u2019s misleading in itself, though, because only about 1,000 legislators have served since the benefit was put into law. We estimate that 39 percent of actual potential beneficiaries have served 10 years or more, meaning they could have qualified for the pension. Either percentage is considerably more than \"less than half of 1 percent,\" leaving this claim as False.",

        "claim": "On its 50th anniversary, Domino's is giving away a free coupon for two large pizzas to those who share the post.",
        "doc": "A post has gone viral on Facebook with the claim that pizza chain Domino's on its 50th anniversary is giving away a free coupon for two large pizzas to those who share the post. WHO CLAIMED IT The post has been shared by Facebook page 'Dominos' on Friday. The text with the post reads: \"Domino's is now 50! To celebrate we are giving each share by 7 tomorrow evening a coupon valid for 2 large pizzas! - Domino's (Please wait 24 hours for your coupon to be sent to you via FB Messenger!)\" THE FACT India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the post is not genuine. There is no such offer from Domino's. Domino's Pizza was founded in the United States in 1960. So, the claim that the company has completed 50 years is also false. The post has already been shared more than 6,300 times at the time of filing this story. Believing the post to be true, netizens are sending birthday wishes to Domino's in the comment section. Facebook page 'Dominos' from where the post was shared is not the official page of Domino's pizza. The page was created just on Thursday and the name of the page 'Dominos' is also misspelled. NO SUCH OFFER Scanning the social media profiles of Domino's Pizza, we couldn't find any such information regarding the offer. Had there been any such offer, the official Twitter and Facebook accounts of Domino's would have certainly mentioned it. The customer care of Domino's India also confirmed to us that no such offer was put out. Fact Checker POLITIFACT also debunked this viral claim. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim On its 50th anniversary, Domino's is giving away a free coupon for two large pizzas to those who share the post. Conclusion The post is not genuine as there is no such offer being given by the company. Also, it's not the pizza chain's 50th anniversary.

        "claim": "There\u2019s been a \"20 percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo after a decade where we lost 10 percent of our young people.\"",
        "doc": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks often about his administration\u2019s efforts to revitalize Buffalo.His recent stop on Buffalo\u2019s East Side was no exception. \"Everynumber is up. Every arrow is pointed in the right direction,\" Cuomo said. \"It is undeniable. Unemployment is down, jobs are up. Young people coming back. Twenty percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo after a decade where we lost 10 percent of our young people. So a new energy. Jobs, businesses, growth. \u2026 Buffalo is a national urban recovery story.\" That's a lot to unpack, and we chose to look at the part about the young people. Is he right? Has there been a 20 percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo? Cuomo relied on the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey for population estimates for people ages 25 to 34. The governor\u2019s spokeswomanpointed to Erie County data from 2010, the year Cuomo was elected, through 2017. The estimated number of people in that age group in Erie County grew by 21 percent. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of people in that age group fell by 8.6 percent, according to the data. Cuomo said Buffalo, but he used data for Erie County. Buffalo is in Erie County, but separate population statistics are available for Buffalo. Analysis of Census Bureau data for Buffalo shows an even greater increase. The 25-34 age group increased from 38,051 in 2010 to 49,207 in 2017, a 29 percent increase, according to the U.S. Census and American Community Survey. We reached out to William Frey, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, which employs experts of different perspectives. Frey has studied the movements of different population groups, including millennials. Frey said \"some of this gain\" is because the large millennial generation that lived in Buffalo aged into this cohort, not because people returned to the area from elsewhere. Erie and Niagara counties, according to aJanuary studyby the Brookings Institution, reported a negative net domestic migration of those 25 to 34 years old between 2012 and 2017. It is possiblethat Buffalo attracted some young adult migrants from the rest of the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls metro area, or had gains from immigration from other countries, said Frey, the study's author. Looking strictly at data for Buffalo, we wanted to see if the 29 percent growthin young people was mainly from people who had aged in place.The age range we're looking at, 25 to 34, would have been ages 18 to 27 in 2010. The 2010 Census breaks out the popularion by age each year. The population of 18-to 27-year-olds in 2010 was 49,734. The population of 25- to 34-year-olds in 2017 was 49,207. The data suggest\"there is quite a bit of aging in place,\" Frey said. But some of those numbers could reflect domestic out migration countered by a similar immigration from abroad, he said.Showing similar numbers for this cohortdoes suggest that not many people left, he said. E.J. McMahon, research director of the conservative Empire Center think tank, also said that while the population of young people increased, it\u2019s unclear how many of those people came back to Buffalo. Some of the gains could be because people stayed, or they could be from refugee resettlement programs, McMahon said. McMahon, who has tracked New York's population shifts and is a frequent Cuomo critic, said that every community has some people who leave and some who stay, and that is \"clearly\" what happened in Buffalo. \"On a net basis, Buffalo is doing better with this population segment than it has in the past,\" he said.\"From this, the governor and others weave a story of millennials flocking back to redeveloped inner cities, because they are different from previous generations and don\u2019t live in suburbs. That\u2019s grossly overstated, in my view.\" Cuomo said there has been a 20 percent increase in young people \"coming back\" to Buffalo after a decade when their numbers fell by 10 percent. Census figures show a 29 percent increase in people ages 25 to 34. In the previous 10 years, the size of that age group fell by 10percent. If the governor had just said their numbers grew, he would have been generally correct. He actually understated Buffalo's increase. But he said they were \"coming back.\" The data he relied on does not prove they came back. In fact, one expert called the claim they were coming to be \"grossly overstated.\" While the number of younger people living in Buffalo increased, the cause could be a large millennial population aging into this age group, not solely because people are returning. So his statement is partially accurate but makes a sweeping, unproven conclusion.It is unclear how many young people have returned to Buffalo, or settled there after living elsewhere.

FACT CHECK NewsMobile did a fact-check and found the claim to be fake. On doing a Google Reverse Image Search, we found that the same photo has been viral on social media for a long time and has been used as a meme. A Facebook post used the same photo with a caption that reads, \u201cA mummified monk from around 100 years ago became news on websites around the world. According to some Buddhist, he\u2019s still alive and is in a deep state of meditation. The body was found in the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, China. It is believed that the cold climate of the region has preserved the body which was found in good condition, wrapped by an animal skin. Next to the body, a scoll was found with an ancient Chinese text that translates \u201d Wake me up when Arsenal wins The Champions League.\u201d A similar post can be seen here. We further found that the same image was published by Mirror.co.uk on January 22, 2018. The article associated with the image read, \u201cDead Buddhist monk \u2018smiles\u2019 as his body is exhumed two months after being buried.\u201d The article further read that Luang Phor Pian died on November 16, 2017 in Bangkok, Thailand when he was 92-years-old. He was a spiritual and Buddhist guru in Lopburi, central Thailand and was originally from Cambodia, Pian. We also found the same image was published by Times Now with a title that read, \u201cDead Buddhist monk appears to \u2018smile\u2019 as the body is exhumed in Thailand.\u201d None of the reports however mentioned anything about any note saying \u201cOnly Yogi will come in UP\u201d. Thus we can ascertain that the viral image is of Buddhist monk Luang Phor Pian who died in 2017 at the age of 92 in Bangkok. Also, the viral claim is fake and there was no slip saying \u201cOnly Yogi will come in UP\u201d as is being claimed on social media.

There is no communal angle to the incident as the accused are Hindus too. Twitter user \u201cAshish Jaggi\u201d posted the video with the caption, \u201cIn Madipur area of Delhi, three jihadists killed a minor boy in the middle of a road with a knife for a petty matter. We are fighting amongst ourselves in the name of casteism and these peacefuls are getting trained for such things? When will Hindus wake up?\u201d The video has gone viral on social media with similar claims. The archived versions can be seen here and here. AFWA investigation Using related keywords, we found multiple news reports regarding the incident. According to these reports, on July 8, three juveniles stabbed to death 25-year-old Manish Kumar in Delhi\u2019s Raghubir Nagar area. The victim worked as a driver and lived in the same area. Citing DCP (West) Deepak Purohit, Hindustan Times says Manish was attacked by three boys aged 15-17 years. Manish had earlier objected to bike stunts and racing by one of the juveniles that ended in a spat. The murderous assault was a result of that. Police inquiry revealed that Manish had thrashed the juvenile some 15 days before the incident when he didn\u2019t pay attention to his objections. To take revenge, the minor, along with two of his friends, attacked Manish and stabbed him 28 times. To verify the claim, India Today reporter Tanseem Haider reached out to Delhi Police who confirmed that all the three accused were Hindus and not Muslims. Police also told us their names, but we won\u2019t disclose them as they are minors. Hence, it can be concluded that there is no communal angle to the murder as the accused and victim are from the same community.

        "doc": "Amidst the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 in India, in a social media post, a woman is seen raising multiple questions on the nature of the virus and its authenticity while she attempts to paint a conspiracy theory picture. Let us fact-check the claims in the post. Claim 1: The World Bank exported COVID-19 Medical test kits to all the countries in 2018. Fact: While it is true that medical test kits were exported to countries in 2018, these were later in April 2020 classified and relabelled as critical to tackling COVID-19 by World Customs Organization (WCO). Prior to that, the products had been listed since 2017, but not in relation to the pandemic. Therefore, the claim is MISLEADING. The woman in the video claims that not just in India, but the leaders of all the countries in the world are inching towards depopulation. She further substantiates the claims by citing the data from World Bank Organization, an international financial institution that provides loans to the governments of low- and middle-income countries. The woman in the video is seen to read out from her notes that through the World Bank website, countries were purchasing COVID-19 test kits in 2018 implying prior knowledge of the COVID-19 crisis. The screenshots show web pages entitled \u201cCOVID-19 Test kits (382200) imports by country in 2017\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19 Test kits (300215) exports by country in 2018\u201d with a detailed list broken down by country (screenshot below) where the product description is \u201cCOVID-19 Test kits\u201d and the year is listed as 2018 or 2017. However, the World Bank has clarified that these kits exported in 2018 had nothing to do with COVID-19 and are misinterpreted as a result of the recent classification changes to Harmonized System (HS) codes in April 2020 by the World Customs Organization (WCO). Prior to that, the products had been listed since 2017, but not in relation to the pandemic. The data and tables can be found on the World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) website. WITS is a joint initiative of the World Bank, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and the World Trade Organization (WTO), among others, providing data on trade and tariffs. Screenshot of the exports details from WITS website These medical test kits used diagnostic reagents based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid test. What is PCR Test? Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is overly sensitive and is performed to detect the presence of viral RNA by targeting one or more gene fragments. The test could also detect fragments of the virus even after an individual is no longer infected. The PCR test is not specific or unique to COVID-19 but has revolutionised the laboratory diagnosis of other viral respiratory infections due to its improved detection sensitivity, rapidness, potential for simultaneous detection of 15 or more respiratory agents, and the reduced risk of carry-over contamination. It is currently used as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for diagnosing COVID-19 since it is the most accurate and reliable test. Screenshot of the World Bank statement on the label misinterpretation Therefore, in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, it was only in April 2020 that these medical kits were revised and classified by World Customs Organization as critical to facilitate monitoring their movements, as a measure to tackle COVID-19. However, it does not prove that countries were buying test kits for COVID-19 prior to the detection of Sars-Cov-2 in December 2019 in China. In fact, World Bank released a statement and clarified that COVID-19 tests did not exist before 2020. Similar fact-checks have been covered here, here, here, and here. Claim 2: The United Nations will establish a New World Order by 2030 which envisions one government, end of national sovereignty, depopulation and mandatory multiple vaccinations, end of irrigation & grazing livestock, private firms, among other goals. Fact: The United Nations official has clarified that the list of these goals is completely false and in fact, attributed these claims to far-right misinformation campaigns. Therefore, the claim is FALSE. The woman in the video continues to propagate the idea of the New World Order UN Agenda 21/2030, which she claims to have been formulated in 1990s and further attributes and links the point on multiple vaccinations to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. She further claims that this is a man-made crisis fought between the top 1% population and the rest of the population including the common man. What is the UN Agenda 21/2030? UN Agenda 21 refers to a non-binding resolution agreed to at the UN\u2019s 1992 Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. The resolution includes 31 goals and aims for nations to take a holistic approach to social, economic, and environmental change, proposes possible solutions for global problems, and aims to empower previously disenfranchised groups. However, since its inception, Agenda 21\u2019s 31 goals for sustainable development have been targeted by conspiracists. According to a 2014 report from Southern Poverty Law Centre, a US-based civil rights group, \u201cAgenda 21 has been transformed in much of the American public mind into a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government, a nefarious effort to crush freedom in the name of environmentalism\u201d In this context, the New World Order document featured in multiple fake social media posts outline 23 different mission goals attributed to the UN. However, the document was neither drafted by the UN nor do the goals align with the agendas it references. Having searched about the UN\u2019s New World Order, we have found the origins of the message to be back in May 2020 in a tweet and also found a supposed unnwo.org website. However, according to the Spanish International news fact-check, sources from the UN General Secretariat confirmed that there is no evidence to suggest that the United Nations will establish \u2018one world government\u2019 and that the website is impersonated by a private entity and is in no way linked to the official United Nations website. LAS NACIONES UNIDAS abiertamente ha adoptado el nombre de LAS NACIONES UNIDAS DEL NUEVO ORDEN MUNDIAL: \"nuevo paradigma econ\u00f3mico, pol\u00edtico, nuevo orden mundial para humanidad\" F\u00edjense por ustedes mismos en su p\u00e1gina oficial: https://t.co/1FGMPrBNRm pic.twitter.com/l5yBFH6b2N \u2014 Dannia Rios Nacif (@Rios_Nacif) May 24, 2020 According to this AFP Fact-check, Heidi Beirich, an expert of extremist movements said, \u201cThat post is filled with all the bogus claims the far right has made against [Agenda 21] for a long time now. [It is] just a false attempt to paint sensible plans for sustainable development as some sort of communist plan, which it is not.\u201d The UN spokesperson also noted that Agenda 21 and the 2030 Agenda are not legally binding. In fact, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2015 that is focused on achieving 17 goals within 15 years. For example, the U.N.\u2019s 2030 agenda proposes a goal of reducing the rates of child and maternal mortality in every country. This goal supports research and development of vaccines and medicines for diseases primarily affecting developing countries, according to the U.N. But it doesn\u2019t call for \u201cmandatory multiple vaccines\u201d, as claimed in the post. Similar fact-checks can be accessed here and here. In summary, the medical test kits distributed by the World Bank in 2018 were in no way related to the COVID-19 crisis, they were only classified in April 2020 to be used against the coronavirus. Therefore, owing to the misinterpretation of the classification of the HS codes, the claim is misleading. On the other hand, there is no evidence to prove that the United Nations is promoting a New World Order therefore, the claim is false.",

        "doc": "There\u2019s no evidence that this ever happened. We found no record of Fox News having reported the story. It also didn\u2019t show up in any newspaper archives or historical records of any kind. \u201cMontana Girl, 11 YR OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS. Thanks FOX NEWS for reporting it.\u201d These were the words that began an old and fake internet story that received a new wave of shares in June 2022. The supposed news was copied and pasted on Facebook and Twitter. We refer to these kinds of posts as copypasta. One of our readers told us that they received the story as part of an email forward. We also found evidence that the story was being shared on former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2018s social media platform, Truth Social. The fake story claimed that an 11-year-old Montana girl named Patricia Harrington stopped a home invasion while home alone by shooting and killing two immigrants who had entered the U.S. illegally named Ralphel Resindez and Enrico Garza. It also falsely claimed that Fox News reported the news and that NBC News, CBS News, PBS, MSNBC, CNN, and ABC News seemingly ignored it. The post read as follows: Montana Girl11 YR OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS. Thanks FOX NEWS for reporting it. A Shotgun-armed Preteen vs. Illegal Alien Home Invaders. Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things: 1. They were in Montana. 2. Patricia had been a clay-shooting champion since she was nine. Patricia was in her upstairs room when the two men broke through the front door of the house. She quickly ran to her father\u2019s room and grabbed his 12-gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun. Resindez was the first to get up to the second floor, only to be the first to catch a near point blank blast of buckshot from the 11-year-old\u2019s knee-crouch aim. He suffered fatal wounds to his abdomen and genitals. When Garza ran to the foot of the stairs, he took a blast to the left shoulder and staggered out into the street where he bled to death before medical help could arrive. It was found out later that Resindez was armed with a stolen 45-caliber handgun he took during another home invasion robbery. That victim, 50-year-old David 0\u2019Burien, was not so lucky. He died from stab wounds to the chest. Ever wonder why good stuff never makes NBC, CBS, PBS, MSNBC, CNN, or ABC news? An 11-year-old girl, properly trained, defended her home, and herself against two murderous, illegal immigrants and she won. She is still alive. Now THAT is Gun Control! Thought for the day: Calling an illegal alien an \u2018undocumented immigrant\u2019 is like calling a drug dealer an \u2018unlicensed pharmacist\u2019 I BELIEVE YOU\u2019LL PROBABLY PASS THIS ON!!!!!! As we previously reported in 2007, there\u2019s no evidence that this ever happened. We looked in newspaper archives and other historical records and found nothing. Further, there\u2019s no record of Fox News ever having reported the story. For some perspective as to just how long ago 2007 was, we filed our previous fact check about the fake story when former U.S. President George W. Bush was serving his second term in the White House. At the time, the first iPhone was still about two months away from being released. Somehow, the fake story still received the new wave of shares more than 15 years later, despite the fact that it had been debunked in articles that were published by multiple credible news organizations. Such articles can be found in seconds with a simple Google search. Why was the old and fake story about the 11-year-old girl shooting \u201cillegal aliens\u201d shared so many times in June 2022? The explanation appeared to be related to recent news. At the time, the debate over the role of guns in American society had been revived following several deadly mass shootings. The new wave of shares also came amid the news of a bill that would increase gun control measures. We found Facebook posts from June 2022 that copied and pasted the fake story, adding various introductions that appeared to attempt to use the false tale to justify being against the idea of increasing gun control measures. In sum, no, the \u201c11 YR OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS\u201d copypasta that\u2019s going around on social media was not a real story, nor did Fox News report about it. Note: Some past versions of the fake story about the 11-year-old girl claimed that the crime happened specifically in the city of Butte, Montana. This also was false.

        "doc": "CLAIM: A video shows an Iranian whistleblower demonstrating how they hacked a U.S. voter registration database during the 2020 election and created fraudulent overseas military ballots.AP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. A federal investigation found that the video was fabricated to make it appear foreign actors fraudulently cast overseas ballots. The falsified video was released by Iranian nationals who were later indicted on federal charges for attempting to push disinformation ahead of the 2020 election,according to court documents and statementsreleased by the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI.THE FACTS: Social media users are sharing a clip from a Florida election integrity event last month to sow doubt about election security in the days before the 2022 midterms.The clip shows a panel discussion during the Oct. 29 Florida Election Integrity Conference in Orlando, which was sponsored by several Conservative groups. The event featured a number of speakers who havepreviously spread misinformation about elections.In the clip, a panel of five speakers sit at a conference table with a red \u201cmake elections secure again\u201d banner pinned to the front. A speaker wearing a baseball cap projects a video from his laptop onscreen to the audience. The footage appears to show a first-person angle of someone extracting U.S. voter information and filling out an overseas ballot using the data.\u201cThis is an Iranian whistleblower, this just got dropped in my lap a couple days ago,\u201d the speaker says while showing the video, adding, \u201cThis is actually real. This is the whistleblower actually connecting in through a special tool that can be downloaded for free on the internet.\u201d\u201cThis is how elections are s+olen,\u201d wrote one Twitter user sharingthe videoon Wednesday, gaining thousands of likes and shares before the post was restricted.\u201cThe hacker pulled our records and used them to create a military ballot,\u201d an Instagram user who shared the same clip wrote in a caption.However, the footage displayed at the event shows a simulation intended to mislead people, not a successful attempt to cast fraudulent ballots, according to the Justice Department, which launched a joint investigation with the FBI into the scheme in 2021.As part of the conspiracy, two Iranian nationals \u201ccreated and disseminated a video containing disinformation about purported election infrastructure vulnerabilities\u201d that claimed to depict actors fabricating ballots through the Federal Voting Assistance Program for military and overseas voters, according to thefederal court indictmentunsealed in New York in November 2021.A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern District of New York confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that the video shown during the Florida election panel \u2014 which the speaker purported was \u201creal\u201d \u2014 actually used much of the same content as the falsified video at the center of the federal investigation.\u201cWe have reviewed the video and although there are slight variations it appears to contain substantially the same content as the false election video referenced in the 2021 indictment,\u201d wrote Public Information Officer Nicholas Biase.During the same cyber campaign, the hackers attempted to compromise voter websites in 11 states, and did successfully download information about more than 100,000 voters from one state. Federal officials did not publicly identify which state. But the defendants did not use that information to change vote totals, officials said andthe AP has reported.Instead, they used the information to create the video simulation, leaving the impression that election results should not be trusted because ballots could be fraudulently submitted, according to the court documents. In reality, the Federal Voting Assistance Program \u201ccould not be leveraged in the manner implied,\u201d the indictment stated.U.S. intelligence officials also emphasized ina March 2021 assessmentthat there was no evidence that Iran or other foreign actors had done anything to change 2020 election vote totals, AP reported.Members of the conspiracy posed online as a far-right group to send the hacking simulation to Republican lawmakers, advisors to then-President Donald Trump and journalists, according to the indictment. The conspirators claimed that the Democratic Party was planning to exploit \u201cserious security vulnerabilities\u201d in state voter registration websites to edit mail-in ballots and register non-existent voters in 2020.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats, among other counts.___This is part of AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",

        "claim": "\"Gonzales\u2019 losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner.\"",
        "doc": "Is Jason Gonzales a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gov. Bruce Rauner and his associates as Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan claims? Madigan, who has served as speaker for all but two years since 1983, was challenged in the 2016 Democratic primary election for the 22nd District by Jason Gonzales, an entrepreneur and high school dropout who went on to receive degrees from Duke, MIT and Harvard. Despite labeling himself as a progressive, Gonzales had the backing of Republicans and supporters of Gov. Bruce Rauner. Nearly six months after being defeated in the primary by more than 38 percentage points, Gonzales filed a lawsuit on Aug. 8 accusing Madigan -- who also is chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party -- of dozens of illegal and fraudulent acts during the election season. The 39-count suit accuses Madigan and others of defaming Gonzales by calling him a convicted felon in campaign ads and committing fraud by putting up two \"fake\" candidates on the ballot to \"dilute\" the Latino vote, among other allegations. In response to the lawsuit, Madigan issued a statement calling Gonzales\u2019 claims without merit, but one sentence in particular stood out: \"Gonzales\u2019 losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner.\" While it\u2019s no secret Gonzales was backed by Republicans and supporters of Rauner -- Madigan\u2019s biggest political foe -- is it true his campaign was funded with more than $1 million from them? Following the money Madigan spokesman Steve Brown told PolitiFact Illinois the $1 million figure came from the Illinois State Board of Elections. Campaign finance records from the State Board of Elections show Gonzales received $278,771 in individual contributions during the primary race. We found some of the top contributors to Gonzales\u2019 campaign fund also have donated to Rauner and some top contributors to Gonzales also have donated to other Democrats. In a phone interview, Gonzales acknowledged he received financial support from the governor\u2019s supporters, but said there never was a quid pro quo between him and Rauner or his allies. Gonzales pointed out many of his donors have contributed to both parties. And not all of his top contributors have donated to Rauner. Robert Hirsch, CEO of Gold Eagle, a company that manufactures automotive chemicals, donated $27,500 to Gonzales -- the largest individual contribution to the campaign -- but there is no record of Hirsch contributing to Rauner\u2019s political committees. However, Hirsch did support redistricting reform efforts backed by Rauner and opposed by Madigan in 2014 and 2016, though that is an issue that has bipartisan support. \"I had to dial for money every day, and a lot of donors I dialed on Democratic lists happened to be supporters of Bruce Rauner and there was nothing I could do about that,\" Gonzales said. Among Gonzales\u2019 top donors was Blair Hull, a wealthy Chicago businessman who unsuccessfully ran in the 2004 Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate, which eventually was won by then-state Sen. Barack Obama. Records show Hull donated $7,250 to Gonzales\u2019 campaign on March 3. He also contributed $5,000 to Rauner during the 2014 gubernatorial race. But Hull\u2019s company, Hull Investments LLC, donated $450,000 to the Illinois United for Change super PAC, which spent $506,000 in support of Gonzales and $367,000 against Madigan. Calls to Hull Investments LLC were not returned, but Hull told the Capitol Fax blog in February that Madigan\"is not a team player\" and \"does not cooperate well with others.\" Hull added that he believed \"the state of Illinois and the Legislature would be improved significantly without Michael Madigan.\" If you combine the total amount spent in the race by Illinois United for Change and individual contributions to Gonzales\u2019 campaign fund, it comes out to about $1.15 million. While Brown noted spending by the super PAC was included in Madigan\u2019s claim, it\u2019s illegal for an independent expenditure committee to contribute directly to a candidate\u2019s campaign. Kent Redfield, an Illinois campaign finance expert and professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said Madigan\u2019s statement is a \"reasonable assumption,\" but there\u2019s no evidence to suggest the super PAC coordinated with Rauner\u2019s office, his political committees or supporters. \"The statement makes it sound like it was a coordinated campaign that involved different entities,\" Redfield said. \"While it may be the case, you don\u2019t have anything on public record.\" Redfield characterized Madigan\u2019s claim as an \"overstatement.\" He added that while it \"assumes a connection that very well may be there,\" there\u2019s no definitive link. However, the issue of dark money makes it extremely difficult to determine where exactly the money is coming from, notes Sarah Brune, executive director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. For example, Illinois United for Change received $20,000 in donations from the Illinois Opportunity Project, a 501(c)4 organization that is highly critical of Madigan and supportive of Rauner. The group is led by Dan Proft, Matthew Besler and Pat Hughes, all of whom are Republicans. Non-profit 501(c)4 groups can spend unlimited amounts of money on politics without disclosing their donors, making it impossible to identify direct ties to certain politicians or their supporters. Our ruling Madigan said, \"Gonzales\u2019 losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner.\" Indeed, Gonzales\u2019 campaign received big donations from people who also gave to Rauner\u2019s campaign fund, but the speaker implies that every donation came from individuals and groups aligned with the governor. In fact, a few of Gonzales\u2019 top donors have also contributed to Democrats and one of his top five donors contributed to Gonzales and no one else. Further, Madigan\u2019s \"more than $1 million\" includes spending by the Illinois United for Change super PAC, despite the fact that super PAC money cannot be given directly to a candidate\u2019s campaign nor can it be coordinated with a candidate\u2019s campaign. We rate Madigan\u2019s claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a1d2957-50ad-4415-a9b1-895f7e25d265",

        "claim": "\"Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before.\"",
        "doc": "Many provisions of the national health care reform law have yet to take effect, but U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg recently made it sound like the landmark legislation already has brought coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans.The Democratic senator visited the Rutgers-Camden campus last week to discuss an effort to prevent student loan interest rates from increasing. But in response to a question about health care coverage, Lautenberg touted the benefits of the reform signed into law in March 2010.\"Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before,\" Lautenberg told the crowd on May 3.The number cited by Lautenberg is solid, but the timing is off, PolitiFact New Jersey found.The health care reform is estimated to provide insurance coverage to about 30 million additional people, but not until after many of the law\u2019s provisions are implemented in the years ahead.At the earliest, the number of newly insured Americans would reach 30 million in 2016, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.In a statement, Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray responded to our findings: \"The President's health care reform bill is working for millions of people. It's going to put at least 30 million people on the rolls and millions in New Jersey have already benefited from new access, lower costs and better service.\"Now, let\u2019s explain some of the major features of the health care reform.Signed into law by President Barack Obama, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes various measures to boost health insurance coverage. Some of the most notable provisions are the individual mandate; the expansion of Medicaid; and the creation of insurance exchanges.The individual mandate is the requirement that residents have health insurance, with certain exemptions. Medicaid eligibility will be expanded to individuals under 65 years of age with income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase private health insurance through the new exchanges.Each of those provisions takes effect on Jan. 1, 2014.Given the impact of those provisions, the health care reform is projected to increase the number of nonelderly individuals with health insurance by 30 million as of 2016, according to estimates released in March by the Congressional Budget Office. That number would increase to 33 million in 2021, the budget office said.However, the forthcoming decision of the U.S. Supreme Court could throw off those projections. The nation\u2019s highest court heard arguments in March about, among other issues, the constitutionality of the individual mandate.If the individual mandate is eliminated, the budget office has stated about 16 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2021.Our rulingDuring his May 3 appearance on the Rutgers-Camden campus, Lautenberg made this claim about the health care reform law: \"Just remember this: the president's health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that weren't there before.\"Based on the latest projections, the health care reform may lead to insurance coverage for about 30 million additional Americans -- but contrary to what Lautenberg suggested, that has not happened yet. The increase in newly insured people is estimated to reach 30 million in 2016.We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",

        "claim": "Microsoft's Webings and Wingdings fonts include hidden anti-Semitic and 9/11-referential messages.",
        "doc": "In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York\u2019s World Trade Center came the resurgence of some several-year-old rumors about \u201csecret messages\u201d lurking within Microsoft\u2019s symbolic Webdings and Wingdings fonts, one innocuous and the other supposedly pointedly anti-Semitic: typing the letters NYC using the Webdings font in Microsoft Word (or similar application) produced, as shown below, an image of an eye, a heart, and a city skyline, assumed to be a rebus form of the phrase \u201cI love New York\u201d (although the last image could really be any big city skyline). But switching to the WingDings font produced an image of a skull and crossbones, a Star of David, and a thumbs-up symbol, read by some conspiracy-minded folks as a symbolic approval of the killing of Jews: The images associated with the capital letters N-Y-C in the Webdings font, at least, were deliberately chosen, as Microsoft spokesperson Kimberly Kuresman explained in 2001: When Microsoft developed a new graphical font, Webdings, in 1997, Kuresman said typographers took pains to ensure that the image corresponding with the capital letters NYC was a pleasant one. Users who type in that string of letters in Webdings are greeted with graphics for an eye, a heart and a city skyline, symbols for the message \u201cI Love New York.\u201d The darker message supposedly associated with those same letters in the Wingsdings font was noted as far back as 1992, when the New York Post tabloid published an breathless article about the discovery of a \u201csecret anti-Semitic message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City\u201d: A computer consultant discovered the diabolic message while installing Microsoft\u2019s new Windows 3.1 software for a client yesterday. The consultant was testing a mailing-address use of the program when he noticed the letters \u201cNYC\u201d had been replaced by a hateful message \u2013 a skull and crossbones, the Star of David and an approving thumbs-up symbol. Microsoft strongly denies any hidden message. Others disagree. \u201cThere\u2019s no way it could be a random coincidence,\u201d said Brian Young, a friend of the consultant, who does not wish to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary. I was pretty shocked by the whole thing.\u201d Computer owners who use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word or any other Microsoft program containing a print font named \u201cWingdings\u201d can duplicate the anti-Semitic message by typing the letters \u201cNYC\u201d on their screen. Microsoft said \u201cWingdings\u201d was designed by Bigelow and Holmes, an outside vendor, and denied that Microsoft intentionally designed the secret message. Prof. Charles Bigelow confirmed that his company provided the symbols, but insisted that Microsoft made the final \u201cmapping\u201d decisions assigning his symbols to specific keys on the keyboard. But a senior Microsoft spokesman said the charge that the fonts contain a hidden message is \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like saying that if you randomly type out characters on a keyboard to spell \u2018Satan\u2019, you can do that, but it\u2019s incredible to say that there\u2019s anti-Semitism in Microsoft or one of its vendors,\u201d said Charles Hemingway. But Young, who discussed the matter with other computer consultants, isn\u2019t so sure it\u2019s just a coincidence. The \u201cWingdings\u201d font contains no letters \u2014 just 255 symbols. Young calculated the odds of three letters of the alphabet being combined with 255 symbols, and said he found that the odds of obtaining the message were less than one in a trillion. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing,\u201d said Young. \u201cSomebody\u2019s responsible for this. This is very offensive.\u201d \u201cI found it hard to believe some of the stories about the resurgence of Nazi sympathizers \u2014 but this puts things back into perspective.\u201d When this conspiracy rumor resurfaced and began to blaze its way around the Internet immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Microsoft issued a statement disclaiming any malicious intent and explaining why the font had not since been altered to put the issue to rest: We can certainly understand how people would respond with some shock to this apparent issue. We did too when it first came up nine years ago and we investigated it thoroughly in partnership with the Anti-Defamation League. The conclusion was that the sequence in the Wingdings character set is coincidental and that there was no malicious intent. In fact, it impacted several software companies at the time and continues to do so. Unfortunately, there was not an easy way to fix the problem. We understand that this requires explanation. At the simplest level, wingdings and webdings are much like an alphabet of characters and provide thousands of potential combinations from which a person could choose. Changing the character set would create an impact of unknown scale on existing data and code using the affected font. Again, using the example of the alphabet, what would happen to existing documents and applications if we switched around a handful of letters? The likely result is that we would create significant issues for people, cause some unintended humorous moments and several offensive ones. For that reason Wingdings has been left unaltered since its inception. Wired magazine also interviewed a typographer who noted that the arrangement of symbols in the Wingdings font was surely nothing more than coincidence: Don Hosek, a typographer and editor of the typeface magazine Serif, said that graphic font designers don\u2019t usually pay much attention to the way particular images correspond to letters on the keyboard. \u201cWe have enough symbols and combinations that it\u2019s almost inevitable that you\u2019ll find something that\u2019s a little sinister,\u201d he said. Although it\u2019s common for designers to include one or two deliberate messages \u2014 usually something innocent like a logo \u2014 it\u2019s safe to assume that the image strings on Wingdings were randomly generated. Hosek said he has known the creators of Wingdings \u2014 Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes of the font design firm Bigelow & Holmes \u2014 for more than a decade and is convinced that they had not intended to offend anyone. \u201cThese are two of the most peace-loving people on the face of the Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way it was anything other than an unfortunate coincidence.\u201d (Penn Jillette, of Penn & Teller fame, also penned a caustic essay on this phenomenon for PC Computing back in 1992.) The last coincidence mentioned in the example quoted at the head of this page, that the arrangements of symbols corresponding to the string \u201cQ33NY\u201d in the Wingdings font is a \u201csign that Microsoft were involved in the terrorist attack,\u201d is purely a contrived one. Although typing the characters Q-3-3-N-Y in the Wingdings font does produce the string of images shown below (an airplane, two vertical rectangular shapes, a skull and crossbones, and a Star of David), none of this has any real relevance to the 9/11 attacks: Q33NY was not the flight or tail number of either of the planes that were crashed into the World Trade Center that day, the rectangular shapes represent pieces of paper with writing on them, not buildings, and the terrorist attacks were neither perpetrated by nor targeted against Jews. The numerous suggestions that have since been offered about what \u2018Q33\u2019 really does refer to (everything from a New York bus route to a verse from the Quran) merely highlight how easy it is to find significance in anything, meaningful or not.",

The U.S. Marine Corps did not immediately respond to PolitiFact\u2019s questions about the blog post.

In reality, there\u2019s just one, and it\u2019s a mountain. \"This is just a mountain that looks like a pyramid,\" Eric Rignot, a professor of Earth system science at the University of California, Irvine, and a senior research scientist at NASA, told LiveScience in 2016. \"Pyramid shapes are not impossible \u2014 many peaks partially look like pyramids, but they only have one to two faces like that, rarely four.\" The mountain doesn\u2019t have a formal name, but it\u2019s one of many peaks in the continent\u2019s Ellsworth Mountains. Mauri Pelto, an environmental science professor at Nichols College, told LiveScience that freeze-thaw erosion likely caused the pyramid-like shape of this mountain and others, such as the Matterhorn in the Alps.

        "claim": "Says you can buy four light bulbs for $1.99 at Walmart, while a single compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) costs \"$10 a pop.\"",
        "doc": "No secret: Many a GOP congressman wants to repeal the new health care law. Also on U.S. Rep. Joe Barton's legislative bucket list? Retooling energy policy, he said during a Nov. 11 speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, where the Ennis lawmaker specified something else he'd like to repeal. \"In a bill that passed in 2007 or 2008, we prohibited in a few years the sale of incandescent light bulbs, like the one that's shining on me right now from the back of the room,\" he said. \"And I was at Walmart this weekend buying some light bulbs and the traditional incandescent light bulb I believe you can get four for $1.99. The little squiggly pig-tail ones were one for $9.99.\" Then the dig: \"Now, if you're Al Gore, you can afford $10 a pop for squiggly-pig-tailed fluorescent light bulbs. But if you're mainstream America, two or three kids, mom and dad working outside the home, that's not a very good deal. So I think repeal that law right off the bat to show that we're going to put market forces back into play. We'll show the American people that we're serious about an energy policy that actually produces energy for America.\" Since we're not Al Gore, we wondered if we're getting a bad deal: $9.99 for a compact fluorescent lamp \u2014 the squiggly pig-tailed bulb Barton mentions, also known as a CFL \u2014 versus $1.99 for a four-pack of traditional bulbs. First, some background: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. Then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (conventional light bulbs) and fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Barton voted against it \u2014 the law Barton now wants to repeal \"right off the bat.\" While running for president, Barack Obama promised to sign a measure into law that \"begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs.\" He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal has made it into law, though in June 2009, Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said those types of lamps represented approximately 45 percent of total lighting energy use. This isn't the first time Barton has spoken out against CFLs. On Sept. 16, Barton and two other representatives introduced a proposal to repeal the section of the act requiring that bulbs use 30 percent less energy than standard incandescents. In a press release from Republicans on the committee, Barton said that \"Washington is making too many decisions that are better left to people who work for their own paychecks and earn their own living.\" Nick Prelosky, an intern in Barton's office, told us that Barton's point was \"that the CFLs are more expensive... a lot more expensive than the incandescent bulbs.\" Barton's press office didn't return our calls on this topic, and after initial communications with Walmart's corporate headquarters, no one answered our queries. So we don't know which Walmart Barton shopped \u2014 there's one in his hometown of Ennis \u2014 or what the light bulb options were at the store. But at a Walmart Supercenter in Austin, we found a wide selection of bulbs and prices. We found a 15-watt dimming CFL bulb for $11.77 and a four-pack of 100-watt soft-white incandescent bulbs for 84 cents, an even greater price spread than Barton said. But a dimming CFL bulb that costs more than $10 vs. a four-pack of incandescents that costs about $2 isn't exactly apples to apples. We turned to a comparison of CFL and incandescent wattage by Energy Star, a joint federal program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. According to Energy Star, a 60 watt incandescent bulb produces a minimum light output of 800 lumens, about what a 13 to 15 watt CFL bulb produces. At the store, we found a six-pack of 13-watt CFL bulbs for $7.97. A three-pack was $4.28. Next, we went shopping online. Our \"light bulb\" search query on Walmart's website returned 136 hits. Again, bulb prices varied. A three-pack of soft-white 13-watt CFL bulbs costs $4.92, according to Walmart's website. A two-pack of soft-white 60-watt incandescents costs $2.54. That's $1.64 per CFL bulb and $1.27 per incandescent. On the pricier end was a two-pack of three-way CFLs for $19.84, which are only sold online, according to Walmart's website. That's $9.92 per bulb \u2014 the price Barton bemoans. A two-pack of three-way incandescent bulbs costs $4.26, or $2.13 per bulb. But bulb life is also a factor in cost comparisons. In August 2009, Consumer Reports reported that \"swapping regular bulbs for compact fluorescents can save you at least $30 per bulb over the life of a compact fluorescent lightbulb... Some CFLs now cost less than $2 compared with $9 to $25 in 1999. Several lasted five to 10 times as long as regular bulbs in our tests, and Energy Star-qualified models use up to 75 percent less power.\" In its October issue, Consumer Reports found that the CFL bulbs in its lab \"have been cycling on and off since early 2009, or 6,000 hours. For comparison, a typical incandescent bulb lasts only around 1,000 hours.\" Lastly, we checked in with the Light Bulb Shop on Austin's Burnet Road. When we explained the statement we were fact-checking, Martin Day, a salesman at the store, told us: \"You can get cheaper CFLs than $10.\" The cheapest CFL the store sells costs about $3 each, he said \u2014 a four-pack for $12. The cheapest incandescent: 75 cents. Let's review the math. One 13-watt CFL bulb costs as little as $1.30 (the price for a six-pack divided by the number of bulbs), compared to 20 cents for an equivalent 60-watt incandescent bulb. But it would take at least five incandescents to replace it over the average life of a CFL. However, if you want a dimmable CFL, it will definitely cost you. On their face, the prices cited in Barton's statement hold up. Yes, you can go to Walmart and buy a four-pack of incandescent bulbs for $1.88 (online) or 84 cents (at the Austin Supercenter) \u2014 prices even lower than Barton aired \u2014 and a single CFL bulb for $11.77 (even more than he said). However, Walmart also sells some CFLs for less and other incandescent bulbs for more. More importantly, Barton ignores other relevant factors \u2014 wattage and longevity \u2014 that undercut a simple price comparison and his suggestion that a \"mainstream,\" two-income family can't afford such energy-saving bulbs. We rate his statement as Barely True. This story has been updated to correct the cost of a 13-watt CFL bulb to $1.64 Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",

        "doc": "A post on Facebook claims that the Taliban survived the pandemic with \"no vaccines, social distancing, PCR testing, masks\" and were still able \"to then recapture an entire country with no mass deaths amongst their population during a global pandemic\". It's true that the Taliban did regain control of Afghanistan during the pandemic, but there's no evidence that Covid-19 didn't affect the group. This Facebook post ignores the fact that there are some areas of Afghanistan the group have controlled since before the pandemic began, and in those areas, the Taliban reportedly claimed it was distributing hand sanitiser, conducting door-to-door temperature checks and enforced a two week quarantine period on travellers from Iran. Reportedly several members of its leadership, based abroad in Qatar, became ill with the disease. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action \u2013 and get our regular free email I'm in There have been over 150,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Afghanistan We don't have figures on how many Taliban members have been vaccinated against, caught or died from Covid-19. But we do know what is happening in Afghanistan more widely. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Afghanistan has had a total 153,736 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and over 7,000 deaths, as of 8 September 2021 . There's no reason to think that members of the Taliban would not have been among those affected by the disease. Mask use and social distancing The Taliban regained control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, in mid-August. A number of photographs taken since then show some Taliban members wearing masks. As for the country as a whole though, it seems that mask-wearing and social distancing were not commonly observed. The Foreign Office's travel advice for Afghanistan says : \"WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask-wearing protocols.\" The Taliban and the vaccine The question of the Taliban's attitude to the Covid-19 vaccine is more complicated. An article for the Middle East Institute, a US think tank, said: \"The Taliban's acceptance of the Covid-19 vaccine is a departure from its usual position against immunization programs.\" It's certainly the case that the Taliban has prevented efforts to vaccinate against polio over the years. Reuters reported in 2019 that the Taliban had banned the World Health Organisation from vaccinating against polio in areas it controlled before later reversing that decision . The Middle East Institute's article goes on to say that \"in the case of Covid-19, the Taliban has responded in an unprecedented manner by facilitating public health workshops and giving permission to healthcare workers to administer the vaccine in areas under its control\". However, we also found one report from inside the country claiming the Taliban has banned Covid-19 vaccinations in one region. And UNICEF has reported that in the first week since the August takeover, Covid-19 vaccinations dropped by 80% . A spokesperson told Reuters: \"The drop is understandable, as in situations of chaos, conflict and emergency, people will prioritize their safety and security first\". Almost two million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the country as a whole, which has a population of around 40 million . There are PCR testing facilities in the country As for PCR testing, there are facilities which have been conducting PCR tests in Afghanistan. We don't know whether these have been used by the Taliban, since they took over the main cities in August. Before most flights from the country were suspended, any travellers leaving with Emirates airline (for example) had to show evidence of an \"official printed certificate\" negative PCR test.",

Anecdotal evidence and/or the existence of policies on the use of hydroxychloroquine are not adequate to indicate its widespread usage among the population. Cherry-picking: The authors conveniently excluded from the hydroxychloroquine group countries with high mortality rates such as Spain, Italy, and Brazil, and from the control group those with a low mortality rate such as Germany. Despite the authors\u2019 claim to have excluded countries with an early widespread use of face masks, they still included Indonesia, which was one of them. Misleading: The authors originally called their \u201canalysis\u201d a \u201ccountry-randomized controlled trial\u201d, which does not exist as it is not possible to randomize individuals to treatment groups based solely on the country in which they reside. Although the authors recently corrected the title, the misuse of the term attempts to give their publication the appearance of legitimacy. The analysis also misreports the results from recent clinical trials which found that hydroxychloroquine was not beneficial for COVID-19 patients. KEY TAKE AWAY Some governments have favored the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing COVID-19. However, this does not necessarily imply that the people within those countries used the drug more often than did people in countries that restricted hydroxychloroquine use. Therefore, correlating countries\u2019 mortality rates with their stance towards hydroxychloroquine use results in a spurious association that is based on flawed reasoning. In contrast, growing evidence from large randomized clinical trials suggests no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients. FULL CLAIM: \u201cMany countries either adopted or declined early treatment [of COVID-19] with [hydroxychloroquine], forming a large country-randomized controlled trial with 2.0 billion people in the treatment group and 663 million in the control group; The [hydroxychloroquine] treatment group has a 79.1% lower death rate\u201d REVIEW On 5 August 2020, an \u201canalysis\u201d comparing COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with different practices regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the disease started circulating in social media posts on Facebook and Twitter. In the middle of an intense public debate about the safety and effectiveness of the drug as a COVID-19 treatment, the analysis claims that countries that adopted \u201cwidespread use\u201d of hydroxychloroquine had a 79% lower COVID-19 death rate than those that highly limited its use. Even though this claim contradict the conclusions of the broader scientific community, they were nonetheless amplified by some U.S. news outlet with large audiences (such as Fox News) and by advocacy groups that support the use of hydroxychloroquine, resulting in the memes receiving hundreds of thousands of interactions in a single week, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. This analysis was posted on the website CovidAnalysis, which is also the name of a Twitter account created in June 2020 that advocates for the use of hydroxychloroquine as COVID-19 treatment. CovidAnalysis appears to be connected with a network of other websites and Twitter accounts, some of whom are mentioned in the Acknowledgments section. These other websites and accounts also promote the use of hydroxychloroquine. Despite stating that the authors of the analysis are \u201cPhD researchers, scientists, people who hope to make a contribution\u201d, the website does not disclose the authors\u2019 identities, affiliations, or potential conflicts of interest. The analysis was heavily criticized by scientists on social media for its flawed reasoning and biased methodology. The main flaw in this analysis is the lack of evidence supporting the underlying assumption that individuals within the hydroxychloroquine group used the drug more often than people from the control group did. Without evidence that the treatment group was indeed treated, the results and conclusions from the analysis are unreliable. The implication that policies favouring the use of hydroxychloroquine reduced COVID-19 mortality results from cherry-picking or convenient exclusion of certain countries, as detailed below. One of the challenges in evaluating the impact of hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 at the country level is the lack of studies that quantify its use in different countries. The authors claim to have included 19 countries \u201cthat chose and maintained a clear assignment to one of the groups [control or hydroxychloroquine treatment] for a majority of the duration of their outbreak, either adopting widespread use or highly limiting use\u201d. However, the assignment of each country into the treatment and control groups did not follow a standardized objective criteria, but mainly anecdotal evidence posted on social media (for example, the evidence for assigning Ireland into the control group can be seen here and here) that does not necessarily reflect hydroxychloroquine usage within those countries. In addition, over-the-counter and even online shopping make assignment of whole countries to one of the groups extremely challenging. The authors also claim to have excluded countries which adopted \u201cearly widespread use of masks\u201d in an attempt to significantly reduce COVID-19 spread. The authors state that their exclusion is based on the countries studied in this preprint (a study which has not been peer-reviewed by other scientists yet), which reported an association of lockdowns and mask-wearing with a lower country-wide COVID-19 mortality[1]. However, even though the preprint listed Indonesia among the countries with an early widespread use of masks, the analysis inexplicably included this country in the control group, when it should have been excluded based on their criteria. Also, the authors did not state the reasons for excluding countries with a population smaller than one million. The analysis contains additional significant bias and methodological flaws, as we explain below. The real sample size of the analysis is not 2.7 billion people, but rather the number of countries Sample size is the number of measurements or observations used in one study, which in this case is the average death rates from the countries included in the analysis. The sample size affects p-values and confidence intervals, which are statistical parameters that allow us to determine whether the results observed are real and did not arise by chance. The incorrect use of such a large sample size can magnify effects which are in truth very small or not clinically relevant. The authors made all of their calculations using the sample size of 2.7 billion people, based on the population sizes of countries in both groups, which invalidates all their statistical analyses and the conclusions they drew from them. This number of 2.7 billion is two orders of magnitude higher than the total number of COVID-19 cases on the planet, making it a gross and obvious over-estimation. Beyond sample size, it is not possible to assess whether the statistical analysis is correct because the authors did not include a detailed Methods section, an essential element in any scientific publication. The authors misreport the results of previous studies, which showed no benefit of hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients In the section titled Literature Review, the authors analyzed results from previous hydroxychloroquine studies in cells, animal models, and humans, incorrectly concluding that hydroxychloroquine was 100% effective to treat COVID-19 in cell cultures and as prevention or early treatment. This is false, as recent studies in cells and monkeys found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing COVID-19 infection[2,3]. Furthermore, prophylactic and early use of hydroxychloroquine did not benefit COVID-19 patients in large clinical trials, as explained in previous reviews by Health Feedback. To support this false claim, the authors misreport the findings from at least three randomized clinical trials (links here, here, and here) that reported no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine[4-6]. The authors of the analysis questioned the conclusions from these trials due to alleged methodological flaws such as fake surveys or small sample sizes, and reinterpreted the original results. Of note, those clinical trials involved hundreds of participants, a much larger sample size than 19 countries used by CovidAnalysis. The comparison should not be performed on death per capita To detect a potential influence of a drug on mortality, the authors should have compared the number of deaths per case of COVID-19 infection: that would inform us on whether the drug helped sick patients. Instead, they used the number of deaths per capita, which is misleading to compare countries since they have very different total numbers of infections. The report is not a randomized clinical trial As mentioned in a previous review by Health Feedback, randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for assessing the safety and efficacy of a new treatment. Such studies reduce potential bias by randomly assigning patients to either the control or test group, ensuring that demographics such as age, gender, disease severity, or comorbidities are equally represented in both groups. This allows us to be certain that any differences observed are the result of the different treatments provided. According to the analysis, \u201centire countries made different decisions regarding treatment with hydroxychloroquine, essentially assigning themself to the treatment or control group\u201d, which they claim is an \u201cessentially random\u201d selection. But countries have different demographic distributions that can influence disease outcome, rendering comparison of drug efficacy at the national level unreliable. The term \u201ccountry-randomized controlled trial\u201d does not exist, as the authors acknowledge in the report. The authors\u2019 co-opting of the term \u201crandomized controlled trial\u201d in this case is not only misleading but also inaccurate, as the report would be best described as an observational ecological study. Such studies analyze data at the population level, rather than at the individual level, and are generally quick, inexpensive, and easy to conduct. However, they are also particularly prone to bias and confounding effects, including a specific type of confounder called the ecological fallacy. This fallacy occurs when the relationships observed among groups are wrongly applied to all the individuals within the group, making any conclusions based on the assumption unreliable. A good example of the ecological fallacy appeared in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012 in which the author found a correlation between chocolate consumption and the number of Nobel laureates in a country (the full study can be read here)[7]. He incorrectly assumed that high chocolate consumption among the general population meant that Nobel laureates were also eating large amounts of chocolate. However, the author did not investigate whether this was actually true. Similarly, the authors of the CovidAnalysis incorrectly assumed that country policies favoring or limiting the use of hydroxychloroquine imply that all individuals infected with COVID-19 in those countries received or avoided, respectively, hydroxychloroquine treatment. In summary, the report is an observational ecological analysis that divides countries into hydroxychloroquine treatment and control groups based on anecdotal evidence in order to compare COVID-19 mortality rate per million residents. The analysis contains significant bias and methodological flaws, including arbitrary inclusion criteria, false assumptions, and inappropriate statistical analysis, which completely invalidate its conclusions. The lower mortality that this analysis associates with the use of hydroxychloroquine is further undermined by the numerous large and robust clinical trials which suggest no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients.

A March 1 Instagram post shows what appears to be a composite photo of the Statue of Liberty, one side in black-and-white and labeled \"1920\" and the other side in color labeled \"2020.\" The photo reads, \"100 years of sea level rise.\" The sea level doesn\u2019t seem to have changed from one photo to the other. But does that really mean there\u2019s been no century-long change in sea level? No. Science gives a different picture. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We were unable to track down the original source \u2014 or sources \u2014 of the post\u2019s image. But Maureen Raymo, co-founding dean of the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University, said that the post\u2019s evidence is problematic. \"The most obvious problem with the pics is that unless they were taken at the exact same point in a tidal cycle they say nothing about average sea level rise,\" Raymo said in an email to PolitiFact. Raymo said that the old photo could have been taken near high tide and the recent photo could have been taken near low tide. We just don\u2019t know. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration collects sea level data at The Battery \u2014 the park on Manhattan\u2019s southernmost tip facing New York Harbor, where ferry boats launch to take tourists to Ellis Island, where the Statue of Liberty stands. Data going back to 1856 revealed there had been a change of 0.95 feet in 100 years \u2014 or about 0.114 inches per year \u2014 the administration found. NOAA\u2019s data was also cited in the New York City Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2019 Report on sea level rise. The report said the local or relative sea level rise in New York City had averaged 0.11 inches per year from 1850 to 2017, as measured by The Battery tide gauge. The panel credited New York City\u2019s sea level changes to climate-related developments, including mounting ice losses from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the ongoing movement of land once burdened by ice-age glaciers. A post claims that photos of the Statue of Liberty taken in 1920 and 2020 show the sea level surrounding Ellis Island hasn\u2019t changed in 100 years. Without information about when exactly the photos were taken and at what point in the tidal cycle, the photos alone do not confirm anything about sea level. But NOAA data shows that the relative sea level rise in New York City averaged 0.11 inches per year from 1850 to 2017. We rate this claim False.",

FACT CHECK NewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the clipping to be old. We ran a keyword search and found similar reports that were published in December 2020. We found a report by HR Breaking News that has a similar headline. According to the report dated December 6, 2020, \u2018the Chandigarh Administration released a tender for the sale of 100% stake in the Electricity Department and Nine companies including big companies like Adani-Tata expressed their willingness to buy the power department\u2019. We also found that the same news was published in Amar Ujala on November 18, 2020. The body of the Amar Ujala article was the same as that of the clipping. This proves that the viral clip is from 2020. We also found recent reports from January 2022 stating that the Centre has approved a \u20b9871 crore bid by Kolkata-based RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group for the Chandigarh electricity department. However, according to a TOI report dated April 2, 2022, \u2018The UT administration will not issue a letter of intent (LoI) to private agency till the matter related to the privatisation of the electricity department is pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court\u2019. According to the report, \u2018UT Powermen Union had filed a petition and had challenged UT\u2019s move to privatise power services. They had argued that the policy under which the services were being privatised in the city had not got a final nod from the government and that it was a draft policy. It was also argued that if all services were to be privatised, it should be in those places, where the service providers had been running in losses, which was not the case in Chandigarh\u2019. From, the above information, it is clear that an old newspaper clipping about the privatisation of Chandigarh Electricity Department is being shared with a false claim.

Many states also use signature matching to verify the identities of voters by comparing the signatures on the mail-in ballots to signatures election officials have on file, perThe New York Times.(RELATED: No, Pennsylvania Did Not Reject 372,000 Mail-In Ballots)\n\nThe post\u2019s claim about 23% of Miami-Dade County mail-in ballots being rejected due to missing signatures is incorrect.Suzy Trutie, the deputy supervisor of elections at the Miami-Dade County Elections Department, told the Daily Caller News Foundation via email that as of Nov. 2, only 2,707 of 489,278 mail-in ballots, or about 0.55%, had issues. Of those 2,707 ballots with issues, 2,059 with no signature and 259 with signatures that did not match were preliminarily rejected, Trutie told the DCNF.\n\nFlorida law allows voters the opportunity to submit an affidavit to \u201ccure\u201d their vote-by-mail ballots if they forgot to sign the envelope or the signature does not match the one on file, according to theMiami-Dade County Elections Department website. The affidavitmust be completed and submittedto the voter\u2019s county elections department along with a copy of identification by 5 P.M. local time on Nov. 5. Trutie said nearly 2,700 mail-in ballots that were preliminarily rejected for not having a signature or not having a matching signature have been cured as of Nov. 2.\n\nThe 23% figure may stem from a misinterpretation of anOct. 16 op-edin the Tampa Bay Times written by University of Florida professor Daniel Smith and Dartmouth College professor Michael Herron. Itnoted, \u201cAlthough Miami-Dade County accounts for only 7.2 percent of mail ballots cast by Florida voters, it accounts for nearly 23 percent of the state\u2019s mail ballots received without signatures.\u201d\n\nTheop-eddid not attempt to claim that 23% of Miami-Dade County mail-in ballots have been rejected due to signature issues. Instead, itargued, in part, that the \u201cpattern of mail ballots received by Supervisors of Elections is not distributed evenly across Florida,\u201d citing Miami-Dade County and Orange County as outliers.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Ana Paulina Luna, R-Fla. The lapels were spotted by Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif.: As The Daily Beast reported,this was not the first time that such a pin appeared on a U.S representative. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., had been photographed with the pin in June 2021. In a later tweet, Clyde took credit for their 2023 appearance, announcing on Twitter that he handed the AR-15 pins out, and that he had plenty to spare: Clyde is the owner of a gun store in his home state of Georgia. As reported by the Washington Post, the AR-15 pins were not the first weapons-based souvenir promoted by some GOP members of the 118th Congress: Clyde's distribution of the gun-shaped pins comes after newly elected Rep.

        "doc": "Did an \"unnamed source\" say Jussie Smollett's phone records showed over 200 calls and texts from Kamala Harris and DNC operatives? No, that's not true: the source of this rumor appears to be a Reddit post by someone speculatively making a joke about a possible coverup but without any evidence to back up that assertion. The story seems to have originated from a Reddit thread published by Reddit user u/ShareThisMeme in Reddit's r/The_Donald subforum for Trump supporters on March 27, 2019 with a title that read: REPORT: An unnamed source familiar with Kim Foxx' thinking told me the reason she dropped charges against Smullett was because his phone records showed over 200 calls and texts from Kamala Harris and DNC operatives. Prove me wrong. (archived here). Right there in the headline there are two hints the story is not to be taken seriously: It misspells Smollett's name as \"Smullett\". It contains the phrase \"An unnamed source familiar with .... thinking\". That phrase was widely mocked on r/The_Donald after CNN used it in reporting about James Comey in May 2017: First on CNN: Comey now believes Trump was trying to influence him, source says Former FBI Director James Comey now believes that President Donald Trump was trying to influence his judgment about the Russia probe, a person familiar with his thinking says, but whether that influence amounts to obstruction of justice remains an open question. The phrase quickly became an in-joke indicating something was pulled out of thin air or came from unreliable sources making up wild conspiracy theories: r/The_Donald - BREAKING: A source familiar with Comey's thinking confirms he is in fact a retard. r/The_Donald: The_Donald is a never-ending rally dedicated to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J.

The original author of the thread also admitted as much in a comment below the post: Note that the photo used with the story is in fact real, it can be found on the website of Alamy, a stock photo service, where it is described as: U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, Jussie Smollett, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, at the 2018 Kingdom Day Parade in honoring the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at Baldwin Hills in Los Angeles, California on January 15, 2018. Credit: Faye Sadou/Media Punch/Alamy Live News But that does not prove (or disprove) anything about text messages or calls, all of that remains speculation. That didn't stop at least one website from directly copying the Reddit post and using it as a headline over an article (archived here): Report: An unnamed source close to Kim Foxx says the reason she dropped charges against Smollett was because his phone records showed over 200 calls and texts from Kamala Harris and DNC operatives. Jussie Smollett may have had all the criminal allegations against him for a supposed racial and homophobic assault dropped today, yet that doesn't mean he's blameless says the state lawyer taking care of the prominent case.

        "claim": "\"Five years ago, when I took office, our state was mired in debt - a $2.4 billion debt left over by Republicans.\"",
        "doc": "Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe loves to talk about his financial stewardship. \"Five years ago, when I took office, our state was mired in debt - a $2.4 billion debt left over by Republicans,\" McAuliffe told about 1,800 fellow Democrats during a June 15 speech at the state party\u2019s Blue Commonwealth Gala. \"...We got the state humming again and we left office with the largest surplus in state history,\" he added. He made similar statements about inheriting a $2.4 billion budget deficit during a Jan. 24 speech at the University of Virginia, Jan. 11 on WAMU radio, Dec. 30 on CNN, Nov. 12 and Sept. 26 on Bloomberg Television, and Sept. 18 to reporters in Des Moines, Iowa. The claim has been part of McAuliffe\u2019s pitch since shortly after he took office in 2014. We fact-checked it in 2015, wondering how he could have inherited a deficit from his predecessor, Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, when the state constitution requires a balanced budget. It\u2019s a good time to examine the statement again. McAuliffe plans to be in the news. With Gov. Ralph Northam sidelined by his blackface scandal, McAuliffe is vowing to raise money and campaign for Democrats this fall when all 140 General Assembly seats will be on ballots and partisan control of both legislative chambers will be at stake. The inheritance Virginia has a two-year budget cycle that beginsJuly 1 of every even year. Before the start of the first budget year, the legislature approves and the governor signs a biennial plan. After that, the governor and lawmakers negotiate budget amendments based on the needs and finances at the time. The state constitution requires that total expenditures not exceed revenues. McDonnell, in one of his last acts as governor, presented two budget bills to the General Assembly on Dec. 16, 2013. The first bill put his finishing touches on the outgoing two-year budget, set to expire June 30, 2014. The proposal, called the \"caboose budget,\" anticipated $35.4 billion in general fund revenues for the budget cycle and $34.9 billion in expenses. The second bill was McDonnell\u2019s proposal for the coming two-year budget, which began July 1, 2014. He anticipated$37.8 billion in general revenues and proposed $37.7 billion in spending. In other words, when McAuliffe took office on Jan. 11, 2014, McDonnell left two balanced budget bills on his desk. So why does McAuliffe say he \"inherited\" a deficit? Four years ago, we put that question to Brian Coy, who was McAuliffe\u2019s communications chief. Coy noted that the economy slowed during the winter and spring of 2014, causing tax revenues to fall below expectations. The McDonnell administration \"left behind a budget that had a forecast that was too optimistic for our financial situation,\" he said.\"They supported a spending threshold that was too high.\" Did that mean McDonnell should have seen the economic slowdown coming? \"With the benefit of hindsight, some signs could have been detectable and some may have not,\" Coy said. State budget analysts tied the slowdown to two factors: \u2022Tax cuts ushered in by former President George W. Bush expired in 2013, causing the capital gains tax to rise. As a result, there was a surge of people cashing in capital assets before the higher rates took effect, followed by a lull after the levy went up. The lull caused a steep dropin non-paycheck tax receipts in Virginia in 2014. \u2022Federal spending cuts hurt Northern Virginia, the state\u2019s economic engine. McAuliffe sensed the problems shortly after taking office, but initially underestimated their severity. On Feb. 12, 2014, he cut the revenue estimate in the coming two-year budget McDonnell proposed by $140 million. \"Although our underlying economic forecast has not changed,\" McAuliffe said, \"it is clear that the current revenue receipts warrant attention.\" Thetakeaway: One month into office, McAuliffe said McDonnell\u2019s revenue estimate was $140 million high, but retained\"the underlying economic forecast\" McDonnell\u2019sbudget was built on. In May, the shortfall caved to an estimated $1.5 billion. The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by cutting $800 million in spendingand drawing $700 million from the state\u2019s rainy day fund. Seven months into his term, on Aug.15, 2014, McAuliffe estimated the shortfall at $2.4 billion and ordered additional cuts to keep the new two-year budget balanced. In a speech to the General Assembly\u2019s money committees, the governor said that out of caution, his forecast was deliberately \"pessimistic.\" The surplus McAuliffe\u2019s usually adds that, under his watch, the shortfall was \"turned\" into the \"largest surplus in Virginia history.\" Although that claim doesn't factor in ourruling in this fact-check, we'll offerfootnotes on it. The record surplus claim stems from McAuliffe\u2019s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. The figure slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year that ended in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. When adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest. Some people hearing McAuliffe\u2019s statement might conclude that Virginia\u2019s budget made almost a $3 billion rebound in one year of McAuliffe\u2019s term - from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus in 2015. That\u2019s not the case. McAuliffeoverestimated the state\u2019s economic problems in August 2014 when headjusted the two-year budget to a \"pessimistic\" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe cites. Our ruling McAuliffe said, \"Five years ago, when I took office, our state was mired in debt - a $2.4 billion debt left over by Republicans.\" That\u2019s just wrong. McAuliffe inherited balanced budget proposals from McDonnell in 2014 - as required by the state constitution. Perhaps, McDonnell should have seen approaching clouds and proposed a more conservative spending plan. But financial projections are tricky. When McAuliffe sensed an economic slowdown during his first weeks in office, he made a modest $140 million cut to McDonnell\u2019s revenue forecast and said he was sticking with the \"underlying economic forecast\" predicating McDonnell\u2019s budgets. Six months later, McAuliffe was projecting a $2.4 billion shortfall. McAuliffe is hardly the first governor to accuse his predecessor of leaving behind a financial mess. But evidence shows the brunt of the shortfall, though not McAuliffe\u2019s fault, occurred during his watch. No doubt, McAuliffe faced tough financial conditions. But he did not inherita $2.4 billion deficit from Republicans, as he\u2019s been saying for years. We rate his statement False. ",

The first screenshot appeared at first glance to have been taken from a CNN article, and contained the headline \u201cDoctors encourage covid-19 vaccine injections in penis.\u201d The sub-headline was \u201cDoctors are discovering that, for male patients, the penis offers the fastest release of the vaccine throughout the body.\u201d The first line of the article was presented as: \u201cBased on findings from a University of California study involving 1,500 men who received the vaccine,\u2026\u201d The article was a fake. CNN never ran such a story, and we could find no record of any scientific study matching the description contained in the screenshot. Furthermore, the imagery featured in the screenshot originated from entirely unrelated sources. Firstly, the illustration showing the \u201csafe area for injection\u201d into a penis in fact came from an instruction manual for penile self-injection as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, taken from the website of the Kansas City, Missouri-area St. Luke\u2019s Health System. Secondly, the doctor shown in the fake CNN article is Mohitkumar Ardeshana, a Claremont, California-based doctor of internal medicine. He told the Indian fact-checking website Boom that \u201cThe article is completely fake. I have not said anything about such a study. It is a work of mischief by someone.\u201d The second screenshot appeared at first glance to be the opening page of a study presented as being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The full text of the page can be viewed here, but the title of the article is presented as \u201cSARS-CoV-2 Recombinant COVID-19 Vaccine has shown [sic] to increase penis length by 3 inches in some individuals.\u201d The \u201cBackground\u201d section of the supposed study read: In a recent meta-analysis of COVID-19 studies researchers identified that those that believed that COVID-19 was not real had a shorter penis by 2-3 inches. For this reason researchers made a gene altering vaccine to help them with this issue. The \u201cResults\u201d section read: Spouse administered 4 mg of ativan in a shot of tequila and gave it to their man. Once the conspiracty [sic] theorist was sound a sleep [sic], the vaccine was injected in the middle cerebral artery after teaching them how to do it in a pig. Of the 666 men who got the vaccine, 667 had an enlargement of their penis by a total of 2.5 +/- .8 inches. Spouses were very happy with the side effect of the vaccine. The study was a hoax. The spelling and grammatical errors and distinctly non-academic language contained in the article readily indicated that it was intended to be humorous, but definitive proof could be found in the fact that the article copied and pasted an entire section from a real study, which actually was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Dec. 10, 2020.

For years, liberal social media users have shared photographs or videos supposedly depicting former U.S. President Jimmy Carter doing woodworking with what appears to be an eye injury, apparently to emphasize that his alleged age and medical history hadn\u2019t stopped him from volunteering. One Twitter user, for example, posted the below-displayed meme about the 39th president in April 2022: A reverse-image search of the meme revealed numerous instances in which internet users promoted this underlying claim: that Carter, at age 95, fell, received stitches and then the following day helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity \u2014 a Christian nonprofit that helps low-income families build homes and pay their mortgages. [See also: Why Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?] The claim was true \u2014 though the incident had occurred more than two years ago, as of this writing. On Oct. 7, 2019, The Associated Press published the photographs featured in the meme, writing: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville. Carter fell at home on Sunday, requiring 14 stiches, but he did not let his injuries keep him from participating in his 36th building project with the nonprofit Christian housing organization. He turned 95 last Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone. The newspaper reported that he and his wife, former First Lady Rosalyn Carter, worked that day on building corbels, a type of support bracket, for a home. CNN also reported on the public appearance, including the following quote from the former president in its Oct. 8, 2019, story: \u201cI fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital. And they took 14 stitches in my forehead and my eye is black, as you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I had a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.\u201d According to the nonprofit\u2019s website, the couple formed a partnership with Habitat for Humanity in the 1980s, and they have rallied \u201cthousands of volunteers and even celebrities\u201d to join the organization\u2019s cause since then. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Habitat for Humanity paused its so-called \u201cJimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project,\u201d a reoccurring event during which the couple fundraises to build a grouping of homes somewhere.
